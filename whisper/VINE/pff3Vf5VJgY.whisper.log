[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   Thank you, Justin. Good morning, church.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.680]   As always, it's an honor to be here to talk, to share God's word with you guys,
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.600]   but we need to talk, church.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.120]   Now, these four words, "We need to talk," can strike fear into people's hearts
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.200]   because usually when you say these words within a relationship,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.560]   it means something has gone wrong, something needs addressing.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.440]   So this morning, I'm here to say, "We need to talk."
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.160]   Now, don't worry too much, okay? I'm not breaking up with you guys
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.200]   and going to Island ECC or anything like that, okay?
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.680]   Don't worry. It's not about that.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.760]   But we need to talk because as I've looked around me,
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.360]   it's obvious that relationships on every level are suffering.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.200]   The past years we've had of social and political unrest
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   added to the stress of COVID has caused some deep hurt and suffering
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.560]   and distrust amongst relationships on every single level.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.360]   Society has become divided, highly distrustful and suspicious of each other.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.280]   When we meet people, we ask questions like,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.080]   "Well, where does this person sit politically?
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.800]   Has this person been vaccinated? Are those allergies or do they have COVID?"
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.680]   And all these things added to the already cutthroat,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.720]   winner-takes-all survival of the fittest mentality
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.240]   that seems to drive our city has led to us being colder,
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.080]   more selfish and self-serving.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.320]   Of course, this isn't new.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.400]   First century Israel knew exactly what it was like to live in divided times.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.280]   Within Jewish culture was embedded a great deal of division.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.640]   Men and women would not interact with each other publicly.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.280]   Slavery and the abuse of human rights was a significant issue.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.600]   There was a massive divide between the rich and the poor.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.160]   People who were deemed as unclean were shunned
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.120]   and unable to participate with normal community activities.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.840]   Certain professions were looked down upon.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.520]   And then from a religious perspective,
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.640]   within Judaism were the sects of the Pharisees, the Sadducees and the Essenes,
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.840]   all which had slightly varieting theologies
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.240]   about what they believed about God and the afterlife and all that kind of stuff.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.840]   Then, of course, there was a division between Jews and Gentiles
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.320]   and the Samaritans, and there was so much antagonism over.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.240]   Then frame all of this with the evil Roman Empire governing their land,
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.360]   and you might begin to see why life in first century Israel
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.640]   was divided and segregated.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.360]   And this is why when Jesus began his ministry,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.560]   he caused a lot of problems because he encouraged everyone to love,
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.040]   he encouraged people to serve, to be in relationship with each other,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.280]   no matter who they were.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.480]   That was Jesus' message, constantly and provocatively, proactively,
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.560]   reaching out and loving even up to his enemies.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.640]   He showed love, he showed care unconditionally,
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.200]   regardless of race, gender, social status or beliefs.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.120]   And we, as his followers' church, have been called to do the same.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.000]   And so this is what we need to talk about.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.120]   Because as I said, at this moment in Hong Kong,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.200]   there is an opportunity.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.280]   Relationships are broken,
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   and we have been called to do for our society what Jesus did for his.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.120]   So this is why over the next six weeks,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.760]   we're going to look at different gospel messages
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.760]   to see exactly how Jesus challenged the status quo
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.520]   and how Jesus challenged people out of their comfort zones
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.160]   in order for us to learn to do the same for our city and our context.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.360]   Now, the danger, of course, is if we don't do anything about this,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.600]   these divisions settle in.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.920]   And as a result, we build up walls that are so high and so strong
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.160]   that we're unable to connect and love each other.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.600]   But as we said, this would grieve God's heart.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.280]   Because we, as his followers, as his church,
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.480]   have been called to be reconcilers, haven't we?
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.840]   To be peacemakers, to bring God's kingdom on earth as it is in heaven,
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.840]   to love as he has first loved us.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.400]   So this series is going to look at all different sections of relationship.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.360]   It's going to call and challenge us to act,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.640]   because we want to see relationships redeemed and restored
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.720]   in the name of Jesus, amen?
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.160]   We want to see a society that genuinely cares for the well-being of each other.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.280]   We want to see people being able to live sacrificially.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.440]   We want a church that truly functions as the body of Christ.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.920]   We want to see healthy, thriving families.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.000]   We want to see a church that unashamedly lives for Jesus.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.040]   And ultimately, we want to know and love,
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.720]   we want to know the love of Christ
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.640]   and be the example of how we approach and treat each other.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.960]   That is our heart for this sermon series over the next few weeks.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.640]   And so to kick things off,
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.680]   we're going to start with the story of the Good Samaritan.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.120]   Now, I know it's a well-known story,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.640]   but let's remind ourselves of it again before we carry on.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.160]   Listen carefully, Luke 10, 25 to 37,
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.640]   and you can read along on the screen or on your device,
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.760]   on your Bible, if you have one.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.400]   Luke 10, 25, it starts like this.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.680]   "On this one occasion, an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.880]   'Teacher,' he said, 'what must I do to inherit eternal life?'
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.440]   'What is written in the law?' Jesus replied.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.040]   'How do you read it?'
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.400]   He answered, 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.600]   with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.640]   and love your neighbor as yourself.'
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.440]   'You have answered correctly,' Jesus replied.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.000]   'Do this and you will live.'
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.760]   But he wanted to justify himself.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.840]   So he asked Jesus, 'And who is my neighbor?'
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.160]   'In reply,' Jesus said,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.040]   'While a man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.840]   where he was attacked by robbers,
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.920]   they stripped him of his clothes,
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.080]   beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.240]   A priest happened to be going down the same road,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.880]   and when he saw the man, he passed on by the other side.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.120]   So too a Levite, when he came to the place,
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.000]   and saw him, passed by on the other side.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.360]   But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came to where the man was,
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.560]   and when he saw him, he took pity on him.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.320]   He went to him, bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.040]   He put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.800]   and took care of him.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   The next day he took out two denarii and gave it to the innkeeper.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.120]   'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return,
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.320]   I will reimburse you for any extra expense you might have.'
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.240]   'Which of these three do you think was the neighbor
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.600]   to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?'
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.480]   The expert in the law replied, 'The one who had mercy on him.'
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.160]   Jesus told him, 'Go and do likewise.'"
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.480]   So a few years back, when Pastor Tim first arrived back into Hong Kong,
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.960]   Pastor Tim and I have known each other for some years.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.280]   We spent some time in ministry here in Hong Kong.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.920]   He went back to Germany and the US and came back.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.080]   And so when he came back to Hong Kong,
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.120]   my wife and I, Brittany, were there to welcome him at the airport.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.560]   Remember those tides when we used to welcome people at the airport?
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.040]   So we were waiting for Tim and we were looking around
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.160]   and we saw a man going, you know, we were in the arrivals hall
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.120]   and there was those escalators that go up to the departures,
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.440]   lounge, and the check-in area.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.640]   So this was a man, you know, he was standing by himself going up the escalator.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.200]   He was standing there like this with his hands by his side.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.840]   But as he was going up the escalator, he was looking a bit wobbly,
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.160]   a bit like this, you know, wobble, wibble, wobble.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.840]   And then suddenly, he face-planted, straight down, hands by his side,
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.360]   like a plank, boom, face down, making the loudest noise,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.080]   hitting the escalator, face first.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.640]   And I saw this happen in front of my very eyes, okay?
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.800]   Bang, hit the escalator.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.520]   Now, a few people around me also noticed what was going on,
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.840]   but I saw them do this and they quickly looked away,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.160]   pretended like they didn't see anything.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.080]   I did not know what to do, okay?
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.360]   I'm not a doctor, I'm not really first aid trained or anything like that,
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.880]   but just instinctively, I thought, "Well, I have to go and check on this guy."
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.240]   So I ran up there to see if he was okay.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.840]   And when I got there, he was lift.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.920]   Someone had pressed the emergency stop button,
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.160]   but he was just laying there, like stiff as a board,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.560]   just laying there face down on the escalator.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.680]   A little pool of blood had started to form around his face.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.080]   So I was like, "Oh my gosh, it was something like a movie,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.760]   like what happened?"
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.560]   And I reached closer, I was going to tap, I didn't want to move him,
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.120]   I didn't know what to do, and I was about to tap him on the shoulder.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.600]   When he suddenly woke up, he turned around, he was like,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.800]   "Oh, I need another whiskey!"
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.840]   True story, okay? It was like it was out of a movie.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.760]   So thankfully, in the end, he was fine.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.080]   He seemed to have a very nasty scratch on his face,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.880]   but to be honest, the whiskey he had in him already
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.960]   probably helped ease the pain a little bit, all right?
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.800]   But I tell you this story
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.640]   because we've probably all faced similar situations before.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.960]   We see another person in need,
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.640]   and in those moments, we need to decide, "Well, what do we do?"
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.960]   Do we engage with what's happening,
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.800]   or do we try and help,
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.600]   or do we pretend like we don't see anything happening
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.760]   and look the other way and carry on ourselves?
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.520]   Now, on the surface, the good Samaritan story
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.680]   seems to be teaching this lesson, saying that
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.200]   we should always be ready to help others in need,
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.320]   always be ready to help.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.040]   And to be honest, that's not a bad lesson.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.760]   If we learn this simple rule alone,
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.520]   the world itself would be a much better place.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.080]   So there you have it, the shortest Vine sermon ever.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.840]   This is what happens when Andrew is away.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.640]   Thank you very much.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.120]   You can go off to lunch now, and worship team's gonna...
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.240]   That's not all, though.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.960]   Because, church, helping others is just the bare minimum.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.840]   And in fact, this parable has so much more to say
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.800]   than simply being a helpful human being to those around you.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.840]   So let's find out, okay?
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.080]   We're gonna dig into the scripture a little bit,
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.280]   walk with me through it,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.320]   'cause we're gonna find out
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.560]   what it's really trying to communicate to us.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.920]   We start again in verse 25.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.280]   "On one occasion, an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.400]   He asked him a question.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.920]   'Teacher,' he asked, 'what must I do to inherit eternal life?'"
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.600]   What a question.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.360]   Now, the gospel is full of questions.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.360]   Apparently, in the gospel,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.240]   according to my Logos Bible concordance,
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.400]   there are 187 questions that Jesus is asked
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.520]   throughout the four gospels.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.280]   Well, questions are good.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.960]   Actually, there's people who are professionals at asking questions.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.080]   Two groups of people, I think,
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.920]   are the best question askers in the world.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.720]   The first are toddlers, okay?
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.560]   Toddlers love to ask why.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.840]   Why, why, why, why?
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.720]   Why this, why that?
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.440]   Why, why, why?
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.840]   And for the first few minutes, a toddler asks why.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.120]   It's kind of cute, right?
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.600]   But then, really quickly, it gets kind of annoying.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.080]   So that's the first professional question askers.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.000]   The second group of professional question askers are lawyers.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.200]   They, too, like to ask things like why, when, how, who, what.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   And for the first few minutes, it's pretty helpful,
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.680]   but very quickly, it becomes very expensive.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:04.400]   Questions can be a beautiful thing, right?
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.880]   If you ask the right questions in the proper context
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.560]   or the right intentions,
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.640]   it can lead to these lovely, life-giving conversations.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.560]   These are the type of questions
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.080]   that strong, trusting relationships are built upon.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.600]   Good questions.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.920]   Questions that address the heart
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.560]   and allow you to share freely about yourself.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.040]   On the other hand, though,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.440]   questions can be used to attack,
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.520]   to intimidate,
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.040]   to intrude into another person's life.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.520]   Questions can be used to make others look incompetent
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.920]   and make ourselves look better.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.920]   In this instance, we have Jesus being questioned by a lawyer.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.360]   But we need to notice the motivation
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.360]   for him asking Jesus this question.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.040]   He's not trying to build a relationship with Jesus.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.920]   Instead, he's trying to do the latter.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.600]   This verse tells us that he's trying to test Jesus.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.920]   Now, the word "test" is the same word used in Luke 4:12
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.280]   to describe the devil's temptation of Jesus.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.680]   In other words, this isn't a regular questioning session.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.160]   There is something sinister
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.800]   about the way this lawyer is approaching Jesus.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.760]   And it says, "So this expert of the law
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.640]   is trying to get Jesus to say the wrong thing
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.680]   so he can accuse Jesus of some sort of false teaching."
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.720]   Again, the question at hand is this.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.200]   "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.960]   Now, this was a pretty standard question
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.560]   for the people in Jesus' time.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.200]   So there was a pretty standard answer.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.080]   This is what he's trying to see.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.160]   Is Jesus going to give the standard answer?
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.760]   Or is he going to say something else?
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.040]   But Jesus sees this as a trap.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.440]   And so he doesn't engage with it.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.040]   He's not going to fall for this trap.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   Instead, he turns the question back around to this lawyer.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.240]   And to his credit, this guy is a lawyer.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.440]   He knows his stuff pretty well.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.320]   Jesus says to the man, "Well, what do you think?
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.800]   What's written in the law?
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.560]   How do you read it?"
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.520]   He answered, "Love the Lord your God
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.760]   with all your heart, with all your soul,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.000]   with all your strength, and with all your mind.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.160]   And love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.440]   "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.080]   "Do this and you will live."
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.600]   It's a classic Jesus move, right?
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.240]   He answers a question with a question of his own.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   This was the ideal answer.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.880]   This was the thing that all Jewish kids
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.520]   would have learned growing up and held on to as adults.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.960]   The first part of this answer is, of course, the Shema,
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   Deuteronomy 6, 5.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.000]   "Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.200]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.160]   mind, soul, and strength."
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.760]   The cornerstone verse of the Jewish faith.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.480]   Everyone would have known this verse.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.080]   Everyone would have memorized this
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.800]   as part of their cultural identity.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.400]   The Shema, like I said, the key,
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.160]   the cornerstone of the Jewish faith.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.880]   But to the Shema, he adds a quote from Leviticus 19.18.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.400]   "Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.440]   And when you put these two together,
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.080]   you've come up with the golden rule,
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.960]   the best answer ever.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.000]   It's such a good answer that Jesus quotes
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.200]   these two passages exactly when he himself is asked,
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.640]   "Well, what's the greatest commandment?"
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.520]   Mark 12.29, he gives the same answer.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.920]   "Do this," Jesus says, "and you will live."
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.440]   In other words, if you can follow this golden rule,
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.360]   you will inherit the eternal life that you're hoping for.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.920]   But like I said, it's not as simple as that.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.440]   This isn't where the story ends.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.200]   And it's at this point we begin to see the true motivations
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.440]   exactly why this lawyer was asking Jesus these questions.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.760]   It tells us this in verse 29.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.920]   "But he wanted to justify himself."
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.640]   He wanted to appear righteous before Jesus
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.320]   and everyone else who was around him
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.560]   so people would know that he himself,
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.960]   he had done enough to get this eternal life.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.880]   I mean, after all, this was a guy in high standing.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.600]   He was a religious leader.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.240]   He was righteous in the eyes of others.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.360]   No doubt that he would inherit this inheritance, right,
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.600]   from the Lord, this eternal life he was seeking.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   So by him asking Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?"
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.440]   His intention wasn't really to find out who his neighbor was
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.400]   so that he could go and love them and serve them.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.120]   What he was really trying to say was this,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.000]   "You know what, Jesus, I already know who my neighbor is.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.880]   They're the people who are just like me.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.880]   You know, I give a little bit to the poor
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.680]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.280]   I do my duty there.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.120]   But I'll have you know that I'm already doing all the right things.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.880]   So just go ahead and tell everyone here that I'm doing fine
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.880]   and that I'm going to get eternal life."
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.560]   He felt like he had it all sorted out.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.160]   He felt like he was already doing good enough.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.040]   Now, we need to stop and think here for a minute.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   How would you have answered the question,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.360]   "How or what must I do to get eternal life?"
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:39.200]   If we translated this question into slightly more modern-day context,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.120]   it might sound like, "Well, how can I make sure that I get into heaven?"
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.720]   This is a question we ask ourselves often as Christians.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.280]   This is a question that you've asked other people.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.600]   This might even be something you use when it comes to evangelism.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.840]   You know that good old question when you ask someone else,
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.880]   "Do you know what?
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.040]   If you died today, do you know where you would end up?"
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.640]   That question.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.000]   I used to think that was a great way to start a gospel conversation
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.840]   until I was in a taxi one time,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.160]   and I was trying to be all evangelistic,
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.360]   and I talked to the taxi driver,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.640]   and I said, "Do you know where you're going to end up if you die today?"
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.880]   And the taxi driver thought I was going to rob him or something.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.680]   He got so scared.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.880]   He's like, "What are you talking about?
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.720]   Why are you asking me these strange questions?"
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.560]   But here's the catch, church.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.800]   Yes, it might sound righteous on the outside,
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.560]   but this question,
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.400]   and it revealed something about the Lord's heart too,
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.360]   was really selfish because it was all about Himself.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.360]   The expert in the Lord might have appeared righteous,
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.920]   might have sounded good on the outside,
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.640]   but His heart wasn't in the right place.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:50.480]   And church, we are in danger of putting ourselves in the same situation.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.400]   Why do we follow and believe in Jesus?
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.760]   Why do we come to church each Sunday?
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.600]   Why do we sing worship songs?
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.760]   Because if making it into heaven or getting eternal life,
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.960]   doing the bare minimum,
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.960]   loving people who are just like you,
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.000]   is the only motivation for believing in Jesus,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.600]   then I would say we have it twisted.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.880]   In fact, I would even say that if getting into heaven is our only motivation,
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.840]   we have fundamentally misunderstood what it means to follow Jesus.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.840]   Let me explain.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.200]   As we said earlier,
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:32.000]   there are lots of divisions and walls to our relationships within our own society.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.560]   If we use the phrase, "Look out for number one," right?
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.360]   This could easily be the motto for Hong Kong.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.080]   Remember during the early stages of COVID when everybody lost their minds?
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.720]   I mean, it was scary out there, we know,
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.480]   but we were hoarding food,
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.400]   we were buying more toilet paper than you could use in a lifetime.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.880]   People were scared, people were hoarding,
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.520]   people were just looking out for themselves.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.560]   What about the business sector?
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.960]   I am not a businessman,
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.360]   but from what it seems and what I hear,
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.360]   relationships in this area seem to be pretty transactional, aren't they?
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.920]   And yes, I know, perhaps this is just how business works.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.720]   But when we start to function in this mode,
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.760]   we start to see relationships as a means to an end.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.920]   And we begin, we're beginning,
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:27.280]   sorry, we build relationships not because we genuinely care for each other,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.120]   but because we want to gain something.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.960]   And if we enter into a relationship that serves no profit for me,
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.960]   it's got no benefit for me,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.880]   well then, peace out, I'm gone.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.920]   What about the dating world?
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.000]   Again, I haven't been in the dating world for a long time now,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.760]   but I don't know much in this area,
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.640]   but from what I ask my friends who are out there dating,
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.320]   the scene is rough.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.320]   Because it seems as though people don't seem to be interested
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.880]   in committed long-term relationships,
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.120]   or very afraid to do so.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.360]   It might spark up a conversation,
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.480]   slide into the DMs,
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.160]   and then just ghost you for no reason.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.400]   So instead of dating to build strong relationships,
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.520]   to get to know each other,
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.400]   dating is used as a means to an end,
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.480]   to satisfy your own needs and move on.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:22.080]   We heard just now about the situation between the rich and the poor.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.440]   This week, I'm not sure,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.760]   you must have seen that SCMP article,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.240]   or the article on all cross-news platforms,
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.840]   highlighting the dividing line between the rich and the poor in Hong Kong
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.520]   has widened even further.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.480]   The richest in Hong Kong, it tells us,
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.080]   earns 40 times more than the most impoverished.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.160]   Think about that for a moment.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.840]   I'm not a mathematician, I'm not a lot of things, it seems like.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.800]   But it seems like,
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.440]   what this means, it potentially takes someone 40 years
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.560]   what someone else can make in one year.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.520]   That's ridiculous.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   But we don't even have to look that deeply.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.760]   Just go about your everyday life.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.360]   We see that looking out for others is quite rare.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.880]   Ride the empty-armed bus during rush hour.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.640]   People push, shove past kids, pregnant people, elderly to get a seat.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.560]   It's not uncommon to see a perfectly able-bodied person
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.760]   sitting on the priority seat on public transport,
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.720]   where there's an elderly person or disabled person, a pau-pau,
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.360]   or a bak-bak, you know, who's clearly much more in need,
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.560]   stay standing, staring at that person, hoping that their seat will come up.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.040]   Oh, but you know what? It's okay.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.000]   We don't need to be worried about any of that, right?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.240]   Because we come to church on Sunday.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.400]   We give a little bit of money.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.160]   We do Bible study.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.440]   We have a community group.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.960]   We pray for each other.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.320]   We sing nice songs.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.840]   We keep all the messy stuff out there.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.280]   And we try our best to stay pure.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.520]   We don't watch any bad movies, say any bad words,
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.120]   or even when we do those things,
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.200]   we don't let anyone else know about those things.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.280]   We remain obedient and hoping that at the end,
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.240]   God will give us the way to heaven.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.160]   That's enough, right?
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.360]   This is precisely the mentality of the expert in the law.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.720]   And this is why Jesus' answer was about to blow his mind
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   and challenge him to his very core.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   "In reply," Jesus said to this man,
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.240]   "there was a person, a man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.240]   when he was attacked by robbers.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.800]   They stripped him of his clothes, beat him, left him half dead.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.560]   Left him half dead.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.400]   A priest and a Levite went down that same road.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.400]   But these two guys, when they came to them,
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.400]   saw the place, saw him.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.160]   They both passed by on the other side.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.400]   But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came to where the man was.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.520]   When he saw him, he took pity on him.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.760]   He bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.840]   And he put the man on his own donkey
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.840]   and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.960]   The next day, he took out two denarii
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.400]   and gave them to the innkeeper.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:10.000]   'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.880]   I will reimburse for you any extra expense that you may have.'"
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.000]   We're going to look at this section of the story
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.680]   because there are a few details
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.800]   which I really feel are important for us to understand
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.520]   in order to embrace what Jesus was trying to teach.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.520]   So walk with me again through it.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.360]   I'm going to try and point them out for us,
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.880]   contextualize them a little bit
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.560]   so we can embrace this story better.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.040]   The first thing is this, a man.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.600]   It tells us a man was going down.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.360]   Now, Jesus doesn't indicate the background,
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.840]   the ethnicity, the social status,
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.120]   any details about this man.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.240]   The Bible doesn't tell us.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.320]   He is simply a man traveling from one place to another
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.080]   when he meets the misfortune of being attacked, robbed,
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:56.880]   and left to die.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.880]   But I think Jesus purposely leaves the details
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.840]   out of this man ambiguous because that was his point.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.840]   It shouldn't matter.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.560]   Who cares who this man was?
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.880]   Who cares about this man's background?
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.960]   Who cares what his social status was?
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.360]   Who cares what his ethnicity was?
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.480]   What is important, the thing that Jesus is trying to point out
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.840]   is that he is suffering and he is in need of help.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.320]   And the question he's asking is,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.000]   "Who is going to help him?
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.560]   Who is going to be a neighbor for this man?"
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.360]   Well, how does that translate for us?
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.120]   Well, we have to ask ourselves the same question.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.640]   Do we make judgments on the people who we help
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.760]   or we choose to help?
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.280]   Are we more likely to help people who are just like us?
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.800]   Are we more eager to help those who we know
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.760]   will be able to repay us back in some way,
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.600]   owe us something so we can call on them
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.280]   when we're in need later on?
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   Or are we willing to see people simply for who they are?
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.440]   Hurting, in pain, victims of injustice,
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.600]   in need of someone to step in and help.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.280]   The story also tells us this,
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.920]   the path, the geographic location,
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.120]   the road going down from Jerusalem to Jericho.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.760]   This is also a very important detail, right?
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.360]   This was a downhill road,
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.800]   as you probably have heard
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.480]   if you've heard this story a few times,
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.480]   from Jerusalem to Jericho.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.600]   But this was a notoriously dangerous road.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.120]   Many hiding spots for robbers to hide
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.360]   and attack unsuspecting travelers.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.000]   And it's a story,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.960]   all three men are traveling from the same direction, right?
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.880]   From Jerusalem down to Jericho.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.640]   The victim, the priest, and Levite,
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.840]   all traveling on the same road in the same direction.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.200]   And the point is this,
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   actually any of them could have become
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.800]   the victim of these robbers.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.840]   It just so happened that the robbers
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   chose to attack this man.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.760]   Now what does this speak to us?
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.640]   As I was reading this, I was just reminded,
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.040]   actually, you know,
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.760]   any of us could become victims at any time.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.320]   Any of us could become victims of misfortune
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.800]   or injustice at any moment.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.880]   We live in a wild and unpredictable world.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.320]   And just because things are going right for you
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.200]   at this moment,
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.680]   it's not guaranteed to stay that way.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.200]   If you want to hear a few real life stories about that,
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.840]   just go and spend some time with our RISE community.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.200]   These were men and women, just like you and me,
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.880]   who had homes, who had families, education,
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.160]   community, professions, income, living thriving lives,
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.600]   but because situations that were out of their control
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.520]   found themselves victims and in need of a good neighbor.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.600]   We too, church, need to be mindful of this.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.920]   One day, what if we find ourselves in need?
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.160]   Won't we all want a good neighbor to come and help us along
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.000]   in our times of help?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.840]   Of course, there's the priest and the Levite.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   The priest and the Levite,
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.920]   two religious leaders of the time.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.240]   These were holy men with high status
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.720]   who supposedly knew exactly what it was like
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.320]   to carry out God's law.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.080]   They were supposed to be righteous men,
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.400]   but neither of them shows even the slightest interest
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.440]   in wanting to help.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.000]   There's a pattern for both of them.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.600]   It says, "They came, they saw, and they passed by."
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:40.000]   They came, they saw, and they passed by.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.280]   Now imagine yourself as a victim of these robbers.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.840]   You're lying there, half dead on the street,
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.200]   semi-conscious, and you see two holy men.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.080]   They would have been recognizable by the way they dress.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.720]   These two righteous men coming towards you,
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.040]   it probably would have been a welcome sight.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.520]   "Surely," he would have said, thinking,
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.200]   "these people are here to help me.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.720]   Rescue is here.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.840]   I'm going to be okay."
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.360]   Only to have them not come towards you,
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.000]   but go out of the way to avoid going anywhere near them.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.320]   Why?
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.840]   Why did these guys not stop?
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.560]   Now Luke doesn't say,
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.600]   and if you read commentaries,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.480]   they come up with a lot of hypothetical reasons
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.600]   why they didn't stop.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.400]   One of the explanations is that
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.800]   they were afraid of becoming unclean,
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.200]   because Jewish law says that you have to be ceremonially clean
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.520]   to participate in temple activities,
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.440]   but that doesn't really make sense,
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.760]   because of the way Jesus was telling his story,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.920]   they were going down from Jerusalem.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.400]   In other words, they were clocking off work,
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.200]   going back home.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.120]   They didn't need to be clean.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.200]   So being clean was just an excuse.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.880]   Some commentators say that they didn't stop to help,
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.360]   because they were scared that if they stopped,
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.280]   it was a dangerous road, like we said,
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.520]   maybe they would have been victims of attack too.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.440]   Maybe the robbers would have come to them.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.240]   So in order to keep safe, they just kept going.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.320]   Now, as we said,
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.380]   excuse me,
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.240]   Luke didn't say why they didn't stop.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.480]   If you interviewed these men,
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.920]   if there was this real life situation,
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.960]   you could sit down with them,
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.680]   they probably would have given you 10 different excuses
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.400]   of why they couldn't stop to help this man.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.160]   But those would just have been excuses.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.880]   Again, we have to ask ourselves this question.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.960]   What about us?
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.800]   What excuses do we come up with
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.960]   when we as believers, as a church,
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.000]   fail to help the people around us,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.360]   fail to be the good neighbor that God has called us to be?
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.120]   It's too messy.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.640]   It's too dangerous.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.520]   Too many excuses.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.760]   There will always be excuses, church,
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.160]   for why we can't be a neighbor.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.920]   Okay, let's bring it back to a Hong Kong context.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.480]   Cantonese speakers, I need your support for a moment.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.600]   If you don't speak Cantonese,
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.920]   I'm going to give you a very quick Cantonese lesson,
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.400]   some basic Cantonese phrases.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.800]   But I think this will highlight what I'm trying to say.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:20.240]   There's a Cantonese term called "fongbi".
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.400]   "Fongbi" is Cantonese for "convenience".
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.600]   It's the opposite of "mafan".
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.200]   Everybody knows "mafan", right?
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.960]   "Fongbi" is the opposite of "mafan".
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.240]   Now, we live in a very fast-paced city.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.720]   We are deathly afraid of being inconvenienced as Hong Kongers.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.800]   Look at the amount of 7-Elevens they are.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.960]   Just in this area alone, there's like six 7-Elevens
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.880]   within like 100 meters of each other.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.400]   We want homes close to the MTR,
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.400]   but also close to our kids' school.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.160]   We want supermarkets close to us.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.680]   We want the wet market close to us.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.800]   We want good options for food everywhere we go.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   We want fast public transport.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.400]   Whenever something threatens our convenience,
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.600]   we say, "Oh, that's too "mafan"", and we shrink back.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.760]   It's too out of the way.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.880]   It's going to take too long.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.480]   Basically, if anything is not "fongbi",
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.520]   we don't want to do it.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.720]   Another term is this, "wun bun".
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:17.700]   Okay?
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:22.720]   "Wun bun" can be roughly translated as "to be tricked" or "to be fooled",
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.440]   which of course can cause us to lose face.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:32.320]   Hong Kongers, we as Hong Kongers are afraid of "to be wun bun", right?
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.760]   We feel this, and this makes us suspicious before we help each other, doesn't it?
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   I mean, we ask ourselves a question, "Does this person even need help?"
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.080]   "Kun me wun o bun, yeah?"
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:44.720]   Right?
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.000]   "Does this person even need help, or are they just trying to con me?"
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.320]   Like, if I actually help this person, am I going to get embarrassed afterwards?
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.640]   Where is it going to end me, helping this person?
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.520]   We're afraid of it, so we don't go near it.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.480]   Finally, there's a term, "sit dai".
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.200]   Okay?
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.880]   "Sit dai" means "to take a loss", "to be taken advantage of".
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:11.680]   Again, if we want to help someone, we often ask ourselves this question, don't we?
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.080]   "How much is it going to cost me?"
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.640]   "Is this person taking advantage of me?"
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.800]   "Am I going to lose a lot?"
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.240]   "What am I going to gain if I give this person resources?"
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.080]   "What's he going to give back to me?"
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.480]   "If I don't get anything back, ho sit dai wo", right?
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   Do you see, Church, how these questions and these suspicions
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.640]   build further walls between us and people in our communities?
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.000]   Do you see how these things are so damaging for the relationships we have with each other?
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.160]   Let me remind us, Church, Jesus has not called his followers to live this way.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.680]   We haven't been called to live safe, comfortable lives
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.760]   where we just wait and die and get to heaven.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.440]   But we have been called to reach out courageously,
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.840]   to practice empathy, to love sacrificially.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.640]   This is exactly what we see the Samaritan do.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.240]   Now, the Samaritan man that comes along,
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.080]   you don't need to tell me, you don't need to be reminded of this,
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.800]   but the Samaritans and Jews did not get along.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:20.400]   And to this day, it's a very sad conflict that's lasted thousands and thousands of years.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:26.640]   And in the context of this story, Jesus introducing a Samaritan man as the hero
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.800]   would have been shocking to the law and to the expert in the law
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.040]   and anyone else who was listening at the time.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.400]   The hated Samaritan would have been the last person this law expert
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.440]   would have been expected to be the good guy of this story.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.680]   But that's not even the main difference that Jesus wants to highlight.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.920]   Not that fact that he was a Samaritan and they were Jews.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.960]   This is the main thing Jesus is trying to highlight,
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.440]   where the priest and the Levite came, saw, and crossed over to the other side.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:58.800]   The Samaritan man came, saw, was moved with compassion,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.000]   went to the wounded man and cared for him.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.760]   This is the true distinction between the Samaritan and the other two.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.280]   Not that they were Jewish and he was Samaritan, like I said.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.040]   Not that they had high status and were unsure what kind of status the Samaritan had.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:22.320]   What individualizes him is his compassion leading to action
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.080]   compared to their lack of care and total inaction.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:34.000]   In terms of Hong Kong practicality, this Samaritan man did all the wrong things.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.040]   He goes out of his way on the dangerous road, makes himself vulnerable to attack.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.040]   He uses his own resources, his oil and his wine,
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.760]   expensive, precious resources to heal this man.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.720]   Takes him to an inn, uses his own money,
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.680]   creates an open account to pay whatever extra charges that might be racked up.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.400]   He had no idea who he was helping.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.120]   He had no idea how far he was going to have to go.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.160]   And he helps without any expectation of being paid back.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.320]   This was "hòu mfāngbīn".
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.440]   This was "sītdai" and this was "wǎnbàn", all in one scenario.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.920]   But he does it all in the name of being a good neighbor.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:16.640]   And my brothers and sisters, this is the kind of church that Jesus has called us to be.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:23.040]   This is the way we remedy the broken relationships we see around us.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.440]   This is what a true neighbor looks like.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.640]   Listen to what Jesus says.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.880]   "Which of these three you think was a neighbor to the man
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.560]   who fell into the hands of the robbers?
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.440]   The expert of the law replied, 'The one who had mercy on him.'
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:46.880]   Jesus said, 'Go and do likewise.'"
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.080]   So this is the truth, church.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.560]   Our city desperately needs the people of God.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:01.920]   Desperately needs the church to be willing to show compassion and mercy to those around us.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.560]   We are in need of genuine, loving relationships again.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.760]   And we cannot be content with excuses and reasons not to reach out,
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.240]   bandage the wounds, and go the extra mile for those around us.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.040]   We need to be the good neighbors of the city.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.160]   And it's going to take more than church attendance
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.640]   and community groups and singing songs on a Sunday.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:33.280]   It's going to take for us, collectively, to sacrifice ourselves,
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.640]   sacrifice our resources, sacrifice our convenience,
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:42.720]   sacrifice our comfort zones in order to be the good neighbor Jesus has called us to be.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:49.680]   And some of these different wounds, some of these different ways relationships are broken down,
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.240]   are going to be exactly what we're going to be addressing in the next few weeks.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.560]   So today, take it as a sort of a wake-up call.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:03.920]   Take it as sort of a catalyst to remind ourselves, to open our eyes.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.000]   Actually, you know what?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.200]   Yes, there is a lot of brokenness around us.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.760]   There might even still be a lot of brokenness in me.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.920]   But I'm not content to sit on the side anymore.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:21.680]   I'm not content to see what's happening and cross by the other side and go about my life.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.480]   I want to engage with what God's doing.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:33.440]   I want to follow this challenge that Jesus sets for us to go and do likewise.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:42.720]   So church, I pray that as brothers and sisters, we go and love our people.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:47.680]   We go and be the good neighbors that Jesus has called us to be.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.720]   Let's rise up to this challenge together.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.400]   Would you stand?
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:39:02.240]   Everyone, I'm going to pray for us.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:22.560]   Yeah, Jesus, we just give you a moment now to speak to our hearts.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:30.720]   Father, relationships are an essential part of life.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.360]   That's how you created us, to be in community with each other.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:45.040]   Which is why when relationships are suffering, Lord, our whole being suffers.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:53.760]   And our hearts might be breaking right now.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:40:02.880]   Maybe as you think about relationships or someone's out there, you're thinking to yourself,
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:09.280]   "Man, there's so much brokenness already in my own heart, in my own relationships.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:14.320]   How can I help others when I'm broken myself?"
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:26.400]   For some of you, you might look out there and say, "Wow, yeah, I hear what you're saying.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.160]   Theoretically, it sounds good, but what difference can I make?
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.280]   I'm just one person."
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.480]   The problem is huge.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.080]   It's so embedded in culture.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.440]   For some of us, you might be doing, "I've been trying this already.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:52.320]   I've been trying, but every time I do it, nothing works.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.720]   Things might even seem to be getting worse."
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:06.240]   But Jesus, you demonstrated the ultimate sacrifice in order to teach us
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:18.640]   what true relationship is, true reconciliation is, true healing looks like.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.760]   And that starts when we only find it in you first.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:32.960]   And Jesus, I thank you for the example that you set for us, that you continue to set for us.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:39.360]   So first, Lord, I pray for healing for people in this room,
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.720]   for those who are hurting in their relationships.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.760]   May they find peace.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:54.400]   May they find healthy reconciliation, healthy process to address the pain and the hurt that
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.080]   they have suffered, and you meet them where they are with your love.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:08.240]   But as we look ahead, Father, help us to walk hand in hand to rise up to this challenge.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:16.080]   As we look at the world around us, as we look at our families, our society, our workplaces,
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:24.400]   our schools, even if it's just, you know, like on public transport, there's always
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:30.160]   opportunities to show your kindness, to start making small steps towards
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.320]   relating to people as you've called us to do so.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:48.880]   So Holy Spirit, come, empower us, embolden us, help us like the Samaritan to go,
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:59.840]   to reach out, not giving any excuses, but simply to love as you've called us to love.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.360]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.400]   We pray in your name.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   Amen.
