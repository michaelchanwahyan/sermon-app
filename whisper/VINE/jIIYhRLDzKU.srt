1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
 Thanks, Justin.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,960
 You know, as a friend and a brother,

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,680
 you don't come much better than Justin.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,480
 So I love you, bro.

5
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,760
 Appreciate it.

6
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,200
 OK.

7
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,400
 November 22, 1989.

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,160
 Where were you on this day?

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,920
 Maybe some of you weren't even born yet.

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,720
 That's OK.

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,120
 November 22, 1989, though, is one of the most important dates

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,720
 in the world because it was the date

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,600
 of the most important scientific breakthrough this world has

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,280
 ever seen.

15
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,160
 In a small town of Hill Valley, California,

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,200
 Dr. Emmett Brown and his trusty sidekick, Marty McFly,

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,840
 got into the DeLorean equipped with a flux capacitor

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,240
 with 1.21 gigawatts of power, traveling at 88 miles per hour,

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:56,120
 zoomed into the future date of October 21, 2015.

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,560
 Now, I'm totally dating myself, and there's a bunch of you

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,320
 here who know what I'm talking about.

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,480
 I'm, of course, referring to Back to the Future Part 2,

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,640
 one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
 You can call me lowbrow if you want.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,480
 I don't care.

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,040
 But it is.

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,240
 It's a great movie.

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,360
 Back to the Future 2 gives us a glimpse

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,040
 of what director Robert Zemeckis thought

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,600
 the future might look like.

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,960
 And it's a pretty funny picture, mainly because here we

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,760
 are sitting in 2023.

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,320
 If you haven't seen the movie, go and watch it tonight.

34
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,240
 Do a Bible study, pray, and all that stuff.

35
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,200
 OK, that's good.

36
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,960
 But then watch Back to the Future 2 tonight.

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,120
 You will not regret it.

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,320
 It's an amazing film.

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
 But this was Zemeckis in the '80s,

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,280
 projecting to what he thought 2015 would look like.

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,720
 Flying cars, self-lacing shoes--

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,600
 I still want those shoes--

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,640
 self-drying clothes, pizza that cooks in just an instant.

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,600
 Remember that scene where the older version of him

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,640
 puts it into the oven, and bing, and instantly it

46
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,400
 turns into a big pizza?

47
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,320
 Hoverboards, ridiculous fashion--

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,680
 we have none of these things in 2023

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,680
 apart from the ridiculous fashion part, right?

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,040
 But we started this year.

51
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,200
 We started 2023 in a sermon series called Will You See?

52
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,920
 And over the past month or so, we've

53
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,280
 been discovering how God is preparing us for the new things

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,160
 through looking at the book of Isaiah.

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,080
 And so we started on New Year's Day

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,240
 where we said we can't put God in a box.

57
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,160
 But instead, we need to expand of how we think God can move.

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,680
 Around Chinese New Year, we stepped

59
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,280
 into the churchwide fast.

60
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,120
 And we talked about how our God is a God of justice.

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,600
 And therefore, we, too, need to be a people of justice.

62
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,160
 And one of the best ways we can prepare ourselves

63
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,920
 to do this work is through our fasting and praying.

64
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,400
 That's how we renew our passion for justice.

65
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,480
 In week three, we had a very frank and honest conversation

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,600
 about sin and its effects on our ability to view God clearly.

67
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,480
 But then we also realized that God comes to cleanse us

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,160
 and teach us about repentance and to give us new hope

69
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,480
 to see Him as we should.

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,640
 We then learned about a new way to worship.

71
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,920
 Pastor Promise talked to us about how worship isn't just

72
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,560
 with the songs and melodies, but it's with our lives

73
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,280
 that we worship.

74
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,040
 Then last week, Pastor Andrew reminded us of our names.

75
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,600
 And he unpacked to us how the labels we give ourselves

76
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,280
 and the others given to us aren't really our true identity.

77
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,400
 But what truly matters, the true name, the true label,

78
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,760
 comes from what Jesus has done for us.

79
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,320
 And I hope it's been a good journey for you.

80
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,920
 But here's the thing.

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,960
 Your journey in the new things God wants to do

82
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,280
 doesn't end with this sermon series.

83
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,680
 Because God is living and active in this world

84
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,800
 and in your life, your journey with Him

85
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,360
 continues into the future.

86
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,320
 So the future, let's talk about that for a second.

87
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,520
 What will the future be like?

88
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,640
 What questions, feelings, and emotions

89
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,640
 come to mind when you think about what

90
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,600
 the future looks like?

91
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,760
 What if someone said, hey, Songsong,

92
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,360
 I can tell you exactly what your future looks like.

93
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,760
 What would you say?

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,120
 This is precisely why movies like Back to the Future

95
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,720
 are so fun to watch.

96
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,640
 Zemeckis tries his very best to pull back the curtain

97
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,200
 to show us a glimpse.

98
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,160
 But really, nobody knows what the future holds.

99
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,240
 And he was way off, which is precisely, again,

100
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,880
 why we're so obsessed with it.

101
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,600
 This isn't the only movie about future.

102
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,480
 So many, Hollywood is constantly churning out

103
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,000
 movies about time travel and its potential ramifications,

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,160
 butterfly effects, and all that kind of stuff.

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,600
 Lots of movies about traveling into the future.

106
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,880
 But even on an intellectual level,

107
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,480
 the possibility of moving between time and space

108
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,920
 is a question physicists and scientists

109
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,240
 have been debating for a long, long time now.

110
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,960
 Einstein's general theory of relativity--

111
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,840
 OK, keep your eyes open.

112
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,120
 This opened up the question, though, about what--

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,960
 if time travel is actually possible or not.

114
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,920
 Apparently, this is what E equals mc squared is all about.

115
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,440
 Let me try and explain.

116
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,160
 I'm just kidding.

117
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,400
 I'm not going to go there today.

118
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,920
 But movies and scientific theories are one thing.

119
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,640
 But the idea of wanting to know what

120
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,440
 might happen in the future is so appealing to us

121
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,160
 that it even impacts us on a spiritual level.

122
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,360
 Think about this for a minute.

123
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,120
 Many of us are so desperate to find out,

124
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,640
 to be sure of what the future holds,

125
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,400
 that we turn to some very dark places to find out the answers.

126
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,080
 Here in this city, all you need to do is go and walk down

127
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,400
 Temple Street, or go and visit Wangdai

128
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,840
 Shen or one of the other temples.

129
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,880
 And there'll be no shortage of fortune tellers,

130
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,440
 card readers, soothsayers, feng shui masters

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,240
 who will claim to know exactly what your future looks like.

132
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,880
 Who are you going to marry?

133
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,840
 What kind of career are you going to have?

134
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,880
 How likely you are to get that promotion?

135
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,160
 When you should have children?

136
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,800
 How many children are you going to have?

137
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,760
 How you might even die?

138
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,680
 All these things can apparently be told

139
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
 by the flip of the card, reading of the charts,

140
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,320
 shaking of some sticks.

141
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,120
 This is very much a part of our culture.

142
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,480
 But how about within our church itself?

143
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,160
 How about within the Christian community?

144
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,760
 I think at times, we too have just as much

145
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,040
 of an interest in these things.

146
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,520
 Only the Christianese, the Christian version of this,

147
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,320
 we call it the prophetic.

148
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,200
 And at times, even amongst us Christians,

149
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,480
 we have an unhealthy interest of what the future precisely

150
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,960
 is going to look like.

151
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,240
 And so what happens is that we turn to God.

152
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,840
 But when we turn to God, we only want

153
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,960
 Him to give us really specific answers.

154
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,680
 So we can always make the right choice.

155
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,400
 We can always be walking in His blessings.

156
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,240
 We can always be on that path to success.

157
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,560
 Now, don't get me wrong, church.

158
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,480
 I'm not saying that God doesn't speak to us in this way.

159
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,880
 And even in scripture, God gives some pretty accurate,

160
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,200
 getting precise prophecies about what

161
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,320
 might happen in the future.

162
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,520
 And I'm sure scripture tells us God

163
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,560
 has plans and purposes for your life,

164
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
 blessings that He wants to give to you,

165
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,880
 good things He wants to lead you into.

166
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,680
 This is the truth.

167
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,480
 God is the giver only of good gifts.

168
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,160
 But if this becomes the only way and the only time

169
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,960
 we look to God, we are missing out on so much.

170
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,240
 It's like there's a huge masterpiece of a painting,

171
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,240
 and we're only staring at one corner of it.

172
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,400
 So let me ask us, what does your relationship for the future

173
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,040
 look like?

174
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,400
 Now, for some of us out there, there

175
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,280
 might be a lot of excitement.

176
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,560
 For you, there's a lot of good, exciting things

177
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,920
 coming up on the horizon.

178
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,600
 And you can't wait to see how they all play out.

179
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,880
 If this is you in the room today, good for you.

180
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,040
 But you can probably leave right now or take a nap

181
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,400
 or start praying for the rest of us.

182
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,280
 Might not relate to what I'm about to say.

183
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,680
 Because for most of us ordinary people out there,

184
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,720
 for those of you watching online as well,

185
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,160
 as you look into the future, there's

186
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,640
 probably a lot of concerns and a lot of fears

187
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,320
 for many different reasons.

188
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,200
 So today, as we close our sermon series,

189
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,520
 we're going to be in Isaiah 65, verses 17 to 25.

190
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,360
 And as we look through this passage,

191
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,800
 we're going to take sections of it

192
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,000
 to see how they can give us hope for the different things we're

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,160
 worried about as we look into the future.

194
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,320
 This is what the passage has to say.

195
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,680
 Verse 17, Isaiah 65.

196
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,280
 "See, I will create new heavens and a new earth.

197
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,080
 The former things will not be remembered,

198
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,560
 nor will they come to mind.

199
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,240
 But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create.

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,840
 For I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people

201
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,120
 a joy.

202
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,960
 I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people

203
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,280
 the sound of weeping and crying will be heard in it no more.

204
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,000
 Never again will it be an infant who lives but a few days,

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
 or an old man who does not live out his years.

206
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,000
 The one who dies at 100 will be thought to be a mere child.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,200
 The one who fails to reach 100 will be considered accursed.

208
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
 They will build houses and dwell in them.

209
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,920
 They will build vineyards and eat their fruit.

210
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,560
 No longer will they build houses and others live with them,

211
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,520
 or plant and others eat.

212
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,720
 For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people.

213
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,480
 My chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands.

214
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,520
 They will not labor in vain, nor will they bear children

215
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,480
 doomed to misfortune.

216
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,720
 For they will be a people blessed by the Lord.

217
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,160
 They and their descendants with them.

218
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,840
 Before they call, I will answer.

219
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,080
 While they are still speaking, I will hear.

220
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,640
 The wolf and the lamb will feed together.

221
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,680
 The lion and the ox will-- and the lion

222
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
 will eat straw like the ox.

223
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,760
 The dust will be the serpent's food.

224
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,440
 They will neither harm nor destroy on my holy mountain,

225
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,880
 says the Lord."

226
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,840
 So as we walk through this passage, like I said,

227
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,000
 I'm going to try and highlight some concerns that we

228
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,480
 might have looking for some hope in this passage

229
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,920
 that we've just read.

230
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,040
 I hope that sounds OK.

231
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,240
 So here we go.

232
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,280
 Firstly, some of us are worried about the future

233
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,680
 because of our past experiences.

234
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,120
 There's a scientific term for this,

235
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
 and it's called "prospection."

236
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,080
 And it happens.

237
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,560
 Animals have prospection.

238
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,360
 For example, if you have a pet, especially you have a dog,

239
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,320
 and you come home at the same time every day,

240
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,360
 your dog seems to know when you're going to arrive home.

241
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,000
 They anticipate you arriving home at that time.

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,840
 And so they start getting excited.

243
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,320
 And at times, if you come home late

244
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,760
 or you don't come home at the time

245
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,520
 your pet is expecting you to, they react in a certain way.

246
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,200
 They feel sad.

247
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,080
 They feel depressed.

248
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,520
 Things like that.

249
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,960
 Ravens apparently have the ability to do this.

250
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,800
 They're one of these animals that store up for the winter

251
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,800
 because of the experience that, hey, in the past winters,

252
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,920
 food has been scarce.

253
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,000
 So let's store up so there's enough food

254
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,520
 to carry us through the colder months of the year.

255
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,800
 But as humans, our ability to prospect about the future

256
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,360
 is much higher, which is one of the reasons

257
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,120
 we find ourselves worrying about what's going to happen to us.

258
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,040
 This is why we do things like saving up

259
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,240
 for retirement and our kids' education.

260
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,760
 This is why we exercise today hoping

261
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,840
 to keep fit so we can live out our years on this Earth

262
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,440
 tomorrow.

263
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,120
 Our ability to prospect is much higher than the normal animals.

264
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,520
 But again, this is why we are worried,

265
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,800
 because we tend to use memories of our past experience

266
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,320
 to predict what our life will be like.

267
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,720
 So if you have experienced things

268
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,480
 that have been difficult and complicated,

269
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,520
 it becomes hard to see anything else but the same

270
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,400
 in the future, just suffering and disappointment.

271
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,800
 This is certainly the case of the Israelites.

272
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,760
 During the time such as Isaiah and Jeremiah,

273
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,280
 when these prophets were active in doing the work,

274
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,600
 the Israelites had been through some really tough things.

275
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
 They had been slaves in Egypt.

276
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,880
 They had wandered in the desert for 40 years,

277
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,720
 faced countless battles where hundreds of thousands

278
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,040
 of their own people have been killed.

279
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
 Their temple has been destroyed.

280
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,560
 The holy city of Jerusalem has been turned upside down.

281
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,760
 They've seen the country literally torn in two.

282
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,840
 They've been through terrible kings and leaders and judges.

283
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,520
 And now they've been forcibly moved from their home

284
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,040
 to a foreign land living in exile.

285
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,080
 So judging from their past, the Israelites

286
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,600
 really didn't have much to look forward to.

287
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,760
 I wonder if you ever feel like this way in your life.

288
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,560
 I know for myself, this is one of the ways

289
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,000
 that the future is difficult for me to think about.

290
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,960
 Let me tell you why.

291
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,760
 See, when I was born, I was born with a genetic condition.

292
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,880
 It's just one of those things that happened to me.

293
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,840
 No one else in my family has it, but somehow it landed on me.

294
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,440
 And without going into too much detail,

295
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,400
 I'll say that it has caused me a great deal of pain in my life,

296
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,560
 in all different levels.

297
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,960
 Now, with my condition, the thing is, there's a 50/50 chance

298
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,800
 whether or not I pass it on to my future children,

299
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,320
 whether my future children will also

300
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,000
 inherit the same condition.

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,600
 And so this is partly my wife and I waited so long

302
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,160
 to try and have children, because we were praying.

303
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,800
 We were praying for God to not let this happen to our kids.

304
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,080
 And so we prayed before we knew my wife was pregnant.

305
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,400
 We prayed during Brittany's pregnancy.

306
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,320
 We asked many people to pray.

307
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,240
 We asked God to spare Isaiah from the pain

308
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,640
 that I had to go through.

309
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,520
 But he didn't.

310
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,320
 And shortly after Izzy was born, it

311
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,040
 was confirmed that he, too, would

312
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,760
 have to live with what I've had to live with.

313
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,200
 And so to be honest, that was really tough to take.

314
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,920
 It still is.

315
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,600
 I mean, what do you do when the thing you feared most

316
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,920
 in your life, literally feared most, becomes a reality?

317
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,520
 And especially now, we're anticipating the arrival

318
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,200
 of our second child.

319
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,680
 The same doubts, the same fears, the same uncertainty,

320
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,720
 the same questions keep crossing my mind.

321
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,200
 I thought God promised a good future for our generations.

322
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,000
 But there's nothing good I can see about this.

323
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,720
 And so my own experience of my past

324
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,720
 begin to cloud my judgment of how I see the future.

325
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,680
 And sometimes I start to think there's no hope.

326
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,520
 So if this is you in the room today,

327
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,640
 hold on to these words of scripture

328
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,320
 as some encouragement to you.

329
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,160
 God says this, "See, I will create

330
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,000
 new heavens and a new earth.

331
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 The former things will not be remembered,

332
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,200
 nor will they come to mind."

333
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,080
 It's precisely while Israel is in the state of confusion,

334
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,320
 of darkness, of wrestling with their past

335
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,160
 and their hopelessness, that God speaks these words,

336
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,640
 "I will create a new heavens and a new earth."

337
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,640
 These words are an echo of the beginnings of scripture,

338
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,400
 the very first words of our Bible.

339
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,400
 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

340
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,360
 And then everything was perfect.

341
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,920
 But this is why the words of Isaiah 65 offer us life,

342
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,280
 offer us power, offer us hope for the future.

343
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,760
 These are words that let us know,

344
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,800
 despite our hopelessness, despite the fact

345
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,480
 that our past experiences have been disappointing,

346
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,160
 He is going to restore.

347
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,200
 He is going to make things new and right again.

348
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,920
 And His heart is to lead us into that place

349
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,120
 like we were in the beginning of time in the Garden of Eden,

350
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,560
 only even better.

351
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,240
 Because in this new place, there is no longer

352
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,120
 the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

353
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,160
 There is only the tree of life, a place

354
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,480
 where our relationship with God is without barrier,

355
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,200
 a place where we can be naked and unashamed before the Lord,

356
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,280
 a place where brokenness will not even be a memory.

357
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,080
 It won't even be a possibility.

358
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,760
 Those things that hurt you in the past

359
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,160
 will never come to mind again.

360
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,320
 And God's not doing this thing just because He's

361
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,040
 like a project guy.

362
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,240
 He's bored and He needs something new to do.

363
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,320
 He's doing this thing because it's always

364
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,280
 been a part of His plan.

365
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,080
 It's an act of love.

366
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,360
 It's an act of rescue and redemption

367
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,160
 for the sake of His children.

368
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,840
 And so this means that even though you've

369
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,880
 gone through setbacks and knockdowns,

370
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,000
 there is always hope.

371
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,440
 There is always hope because God acts.

372
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,760
 And contrary to popular belief, the world

373
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,560
 is not going to hell in a handbasket

374
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,240
 because when God works, when God decides

375
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,320
 that He is going to do something new, and when God restores,

376
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,600
 the effects are going to be so perfect.

377
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,640
 Like I said just now, one day you're

378
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,240
 not even going to remember the disappointments of the past.

379
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,520
 That's a word for you today.

380
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,160
 And just as an answer to my own prayers,

381
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,320
 and I didn't share this with the morning,

382
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,800
 I just remember this, in the things

383
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,640
 that Isaiah's had to do, a ton of doctor's appointments

384
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,120
 and all this kind of stuff.

385
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,120
 And actually, we found out that on the year that he was born,

386
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
 there's been a new drug, a new treatment that's

387
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,080
 come out precisely targeting kids with his condition.

388
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,480
 That's an answer of God that we never thought was possible.

389
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,400
 When I was a kid, definitely that was not an option.

390
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,760
 So we're exploring these things right now.

391
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,720
 But we see that as an answer to how God has been

392
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,480
 working in our family's life.

393
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,720
 And also come to remember that God's answer to us,

394
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,600
 to our family, was not that He would not

395
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,680
 inherit it as badly as we wanted that to happen,

396
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,880
 but was the fact that I'm going to be with you in this.

397
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,080
 That was His word to us.

398
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,200
 So take that as an encouragement to you.

399
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,720
 Secondly, some of us in this room

400
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,080
 are worried about the future because of our own sin

401
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,280
 and the mistakes that we have made,

402
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,080
 or maybe the mess that we're currently sitting in.

403
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,200
 And so when you look ahead, it's hard

404
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,360
 to imagine what life might be like if you

405
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,880
 were to be free from the chains that are binding you right now.

406
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,800
 It's going to be hard.

407
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,640
 It's hard because that's all you've known.

408
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,280
 That's all you've been sitting in for so long now,

409
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,880
 that your sin has affected how you think about the future.

410
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,720
 It's important to remember and realize

411
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,160
 that the Israelites were in this miserable position

412
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,960
 in the first place because of their own sin

413
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,520
 and their own tendencies to turn away from God

414
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,640
 and begin to worship idols.

415
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,760
 Their relationship with God was once strong,

416
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,680
 but now the Israelites were stuck in this futile practice

417
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,840
 of trying to worship God and do other rituals,

418
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,800
 but at the same time, continuing to live life on their own terms,

419
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,960
 worshiping idols, doing as the nations around them did.

420
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,200
 It wasn't that God was far away, but they simply

421
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,560
 refused to listen to Him.

422
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,800
 And because of this, they found themselves

423
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,680
 suffering in the consequences of their own sin.

424
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,080
 Or in more colloquial terms, they messed around

425
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,000
 and they found out that sin isn't something

426
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,480
 you can play with.

427
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,320
 And this may be some of us today.

428
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,360
 Yes, we come to church.

429
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,240
 We're connected to a community group.

430
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,880
 We serve.

431
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,440
 We tithe.

432
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,240
 We do all the right things, but we

433
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,320
 know that we haven't fully surrendered to God.

434
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,360
 We know that our relationship with God

435
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,520
 is still ruled by darkness in some areas.

436
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,400
 And where your relationship with Him, yes,

437
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,880
 might once have been strong.

438
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,460
 We used to hear from God all the time,

439
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,920
 but now when we ask God to speak to us,

440
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,800
 we can't hear anything because of our sin.

441
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,440
 And we feel like we're abandoned.

442
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,220
 You feel like God doesn't like you anymore.

443
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,280
 And sin has sapped away the joy from your relationship

444
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,380
 with God.

445
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,680
 For those of you who are in this position,

446
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,760
 these are the words of encouragement for you today.

447
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,680
 "Be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create.

448
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,560
 For I will create Jerusalem to be a delight,

449
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,840
 and its people a joy.

450
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,760
 I will rejoice over Jerusalem," and listen to this,

451
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,720
 "and take delight in my people."

452
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,400
 So here's the truth.

453
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,440
 Yes, sin does put up a barrier between us and God.

454
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,520
 And there's most definitely consequences to our sins.

455
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,360
 That's for sure.

456
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,760
 But at the same time, when God works,

457
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,480
 when God renews and restores, He even

458
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,480
 is able to reverse the effects of sin

459
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
 so that they will no longer be able to separate us

460
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,520
 from the relationship we can have with God.

461
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,000
 Later on in Isaiah 21, 65, 21, and 22, it says this.

462
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,160
 "They will build houses and dwell in them.

463
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,240
 They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.

464
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,000
 No longer will they build houses and others live with them

465
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,320
 or plant and others eat."

466
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,240
 Now, it seems like a bit of a random passage

467
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,200
 to throw in there.

468
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,600
 But this is a declaration.

469
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,040
 It's not just a blessing.

470
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,520
 This is God reversing the punishment and the consequences

471
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,440
 that He had previously warned the Israelites about.

472
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,200
 If you go back to Deuteronomy 28, 30,

473
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,600
 God warns His people that if they disobey Him,

474
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,960
 if they continue to worship idols and do other things

475
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,760
 that they're not supposed to do, these

476
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,720
 are the results that are waiting for them.

477
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,200
 "You will build a house, but you will not live in it.

478
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,000
 You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even

479
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,680
 begin to enjoy its fruit."

480
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,120
 That was the warning from God.

481
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,040
 And this is the situation that the Israelites

482
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,000
 found themselves in.

483
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,640
 But in the new thing that God is doing, in the new heavens,

484
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,840
 in the new earth, this curse is reversed.

485
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,560
 You see, Jerusalem was always meant

486
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,560
 to be the symbol of God's presence here on earth,

487
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,220
 but has since then been corrupted by sin

488
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,320
 and as a result, destroyed by pagan worshipping armies

489
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,680
 back in the day.

490
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,920
 But even so, it says, God will restore it

491
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,560
 to its rightful place of bringing delight to God.

492
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,600
 The same goes for you.

493
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,360
 You who think because of your sin,

494
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,040
 there is no hope for your future.

495
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,680
 You who think God doesn't want anything

496
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,960
 to do with you anymore because of your sin.

497
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,680
 This is an encouragement for you,

498
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,680
 because God's heart is still to bring you out of the darkness

499
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,720
 into the light.

500
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,760
 God's heart is to create in you a new person, a new heart

501
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,880
 to restore the joy that sin has eaten away.

502
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,200
 You are part of his people.

503
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,240
 You belong to him.

504
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,760
 And because of this, he takes delight in you.

505
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,800
 There is hope.

506
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:47,720
 Some of us, when we look to the future,

507
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,600
 our view of the future is jaded because despite

508
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,920
 of our hard work, despite of our best efforts,

509
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,520
 nothing ever seems to pay off.

510
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,940
 And so we feel like we should just stop trying and give up,

511
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,240
 because well, what's the point?

512
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,240
 Nothing ever comes to fruition anyway.

513
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,920
 If you're a student in this room, you might understand.

514
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,640
 You might play out like this.

515
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,280
 You find yourself studying.

516
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,600
 That big exam is coming.

517
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,000
 So you bust your butt.

518
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,120
 You stay up late.

519
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,880
 You work hard.

520
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,680
 You do all the preparation.

521
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,840
 You go to the extra classes.

522
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,000
 And when on results day, when you take the exam and results

523
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,440
 day, they come out, you failed.

524
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,120
 Or you've missed it by like half a mark or something like that.

525
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,000
 And it's just so soul crushing.

526
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,560
 You don't know what to do.

527
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,280
 I thought I worked hard.

528
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,400
 Or on the contrary, you get the results that you wanted,

529
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,360
 even good marks.

530
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,880
 But even then, you don't get any praise or accreditation,

531
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,720
 because that's just what's expected of you

532
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,920
 in the first place.

533
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,680
 This might play out for you in the workplace.

534
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,840
 You spend endless hours working in the office,

535
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,960
 staying late, making sure everything is done right.

536
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,520
 You go above and beyond.

537
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,080
 You do the things that nobody else does to make

538
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,760
 sure nothing falls apart.

539
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,760
 But in the end, you never get the credit for it.

540
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,920
 Your boss never seems to notice.

541
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,880
 And even worse, it's the people around you

542
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,800
 that seem to do no work, that ride off

543
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,000
 the coattails of other people's hard work, that slack off.

544
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,640
 These are the people that get the raises and the promotions.

545
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,640
 Maybe this plays out for you in your relationships.

546
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,760
 You finally think you found the right person for you.

547
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,960
 So you do all the right things.

548
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,920
 You open up.

549
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
 You communicate.

550
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,640
 You're vulnerable.

551
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,800
 You're authentic.

552
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,400
 You give this person your trust.

553
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,200
 You share your deepest, most intimate feelings, thoughts,

554
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,640
 and emotions with this person.

555
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,120
 You even invest your resources into this relationship,

556
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,520
 only to have your heart broken yet again.

557
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,040
 If this is you, hold on to these words

558
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,240
 as a source of encouragement.

559
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,200
 "For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people.

560
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,480
 My chosen ones will enjoy the work of the hands.

561
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,080
 They will not labor in vain, nor will they

562
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,280
 bear children doomed to misfortune,

563
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,120
 for they will be a people blessed by the Lord."

564
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,360
 In the new thing God is doing, in the new heavens

565
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,880
 and the new earth that God is leading you into,

566
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,000
 he tells us that your efforts will never return void.

567
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,760
 But rather, God sees your efforts.

568
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,640
 He notices the journey that you've been on.

569
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,000
 He sees the hard work that you've been putting in.

570
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,120
 And his promise is that you will be blessed for this in the end.

571
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,800
 So take heart.

572
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,400
 Some of us don't want even to think about the future,

573
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,840
 because all we can see is pain.

574
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,720
 It's similar to what we talked about just now.

575
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,480
 We don't want to dream or think about what

576
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,400
 could be, because we don't want to get our hopes up just

577
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,720
 to have them dashed again.

578
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
 There were plans that you had, visions

579
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,840
 that you had for your future.

580
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,840
 But instead of seeing life blossom,

581
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,200
 you've experienced a lot of loss, a miscarriage,

582
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,600
 the untimely passing of a loved one,

583
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,680
 the break off of an engagement, a divorce, loss

584
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,320
 of jobs and finances, a horrible diagnosis,

585
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,400
 the breakdown of a friendship that was once strong.

586
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,760
 As a pastor in this community, I've sat with you

587
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,600
 and walked with many of you through these things.

588
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,640
 I myself have walked in these things.

589
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,840
 And so if this is you today, take this as your encouragement.

590
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,360
 In this new heavens and the new earth,

591
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,680
 the sound of weeping and crying will be heard in it no more.

592
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,440
 Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few

593
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,080
 days or an old man who does not live out his years.

594
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,360
 The one who dies at 100 will be thought a mere child.

595
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,960
 The one who fails to reach 100 will be considered accursed.

596
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,960
 God promises us that there is a future coming where things

597
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,160
 like this will no longer happen.

598
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,640
 There is a future coming where life will always blossom

599
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,360
 and live out to its full potential.

600
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,280
 There is a time coming where your efforts will bear the fruit

601
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,880
 that you've been praying that it will bear.

602
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,240
 This is what the heart of the passage is trying to say.

603
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,160
 It's a poetic way of reminding us that in the new heavens

604
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:35,560
 and the new earth, pain will no longer be the ending.

605
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,120
 But rather, as Jesus has said, we will get to enjoy life

606
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,360
 and life in the full.

607
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,960
 Some of us don't see much hope in the future because we feel

608
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,760
 like God has given up on us.

609
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,440
 And I'm talking to the ones out there who've been serving

610
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,600
 the Lord faithfully.

611
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,080
 You've been serving God faithfully.

612
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,560
 You've really tried to live a life free from sin.

613
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,160
 You are dedicated in your walk with God.

614
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,760
 You've poured yourself out for the sake of your gospel.

615
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,360
 You have sacrificed.

616
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,200
 And whilst you've seen God work powerfully

617
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,560
 in other people's lives, you feel as though God

618
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,040
 has given up on you.

619
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,240
 The blessings that you pray for other people

620
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,800
 never seem to come your way.

621
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,120
 And so it feels like God doesn't really care about you.

622
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,600
 And you're about one unanswered prayer

623
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,040
 from giving up on your relationship with God

624
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,040
 altogether.

625
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:39,960
 My brother, my sister, if this is you today, hang on.

626
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,680
 Take this as a word of encouragement to you.

627
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,120
 Before they call, I will answer.

628
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,360
 While they are still speaking, I will hear.

629
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,040
 God is reminding us of His intimacy with us in this verse.

630
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,960
 This is a reassurance that He is still listening to you.

631
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,520
 He knows you so well that He anticipates your needs.

632
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,280
 God is like that best friend, that person

633
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,720
 that you're most in tune with.

634
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,160
 You know that person who seems to be able to complete

635
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,120
 your sentences for you?

636
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,720
 The person who knows your most innermost thoughts,

637
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,600
 the friend who hears you, who understands you,

638
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,280
 who will never give up on you.

639
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,600
 God has not given up on you, which

640
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,200
 is precisely why He's doing the new thing that He's

641
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,040
 promised us.

642
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,760
 Now I know what you're thinking, too.

643
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,840
 This all sounds good in theory, but the truth

644
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,560
 is I'm still struggling right now.

645
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,440
 The truth is when I wake up tomorrow,

646
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,680
 most likely I'm still going to be carrying some

647
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,840
 of that pain and uncertainty.

648
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,960
 And if God is doing all these things in the end,

649
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,560
 then why do we need to bother with anything?

650
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,920
 Well, what's the point?

651
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,200
 Why don't we just sit around and wait for it to happen,

652
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,960
 let God do His thing?

653
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,280
 Why is God showing us these things?

654
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,320
 Is it just to tantalize us, to try and give us

655
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,000
 a little bit of hope and just make us impatient and long

656
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,200
 for these things to come?

657
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,840
 No.

658
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,000
 God is pulling back the curtain to show us

659
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,640
 a glimpse of what the future might be like,

660
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,920
 because it's actually an invitation for us

661
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,840
 to join Him in this work of making things new,

662
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,480
 in this work of restoration.

663
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,960
 This is one of the most challenging yet most exciting

664
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,840
 things about being in a vibrant relationship with the living

665
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,040
 God, because our role is not to sit around dreaming and hoping

666
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,680
 of better things to come, but God

667
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,840
 has called us to actively take part in shaping the future.

668
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,440
 God chose us the future, yes, in some ways, of course,

669
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,600
 to give us hope for tomorrow, but also

670
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,960
 to move us into action today.

671
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,680
 So this is what we mean when we say things

672
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,480
 like we want God's heart.

673
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,600
 This is what we mean when we sing songs like,

674
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,360
 show me how to love like you have loved me.

675
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,640
 Break my heart for what breaks yours.

676
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,400
 God doesn't show us visions to tantalize our imagination,

677
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,720
 to make us homesick for our home in heaven,

678
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,880
 but rather, He is asking us to embrace these things

679
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,480
 and join Him in His work of revealing His restoration

680
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,680
 to the rest of the world.

681
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,840
 A commentary I was researching in preparation for this message

682
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,760
 put it this way, "No goal short of the restoration

683
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,320
 of all God's creation to its intended wholeness

684
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,880
 will satisfy the yearning of the servant of the Lord."

685
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,280
 So what this means is this, the things

686
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,560
 that you've gone through, even the terrible, horrible things

687
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,440
 that you're going through, have gone through,

688
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
 the disappointments, the heartbreak, the grief,

689
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,640
 and the mourning, all these things

690
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,440
 can be the help and understanding that

691
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,240
 is needed to guide you in how you can contribute

692
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,000
 to God's vision of this new heavens and the new earth.

693
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,240
 Revelation 21, 1 to 4, in an echo of what Isaiah says,

694
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,120
 tells us this, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.

695
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,520
 The first heaven and first earth had passed away,

696
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,280
 and there was no longer any sea.

697
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,160
 I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem,

698
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,720
 coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride,

699
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,040
 beautifully dressed for a husband.

700
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,560
 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,

701
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,240
 'Look, God's dwelling place is now among the people,

702
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,560
 and He will dwell with them.

703
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,560
 They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them

704
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,240
 and be their God.

705
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,000
 He will wipe every tear from their eyes.

706
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain,

707
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,360
 for the old order of things has passed away.'"

708
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,520
 This church is where the world is heading.

709
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,120
 And I know we're in this awkward stage

710
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,720
 right now where we already know how the story is going to end,

711
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,200
 but we're not there yet.

712
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,440
 The beautiful thing about knowing how the story ends,

713
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,360
 though, is that we get to live for that moment right now.

714
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,040
 We get to live like we're in the new heavens and the new earth.

715
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,160
 God is saying to His people, "I see your hurt.

716
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,680
 I see your pain.

717
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,960
 I see the uncertainties.

718
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,320
 I understand why you might have questions about how

719
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,800
 the future is going to turn out.

720
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,680
 But don't let the loss of right now define your future.

721
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,240
 Trust me.

722
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,120
 Let me define the future."

723
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,920
 So in light of this, allow me to challenge us

724
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,120
 with a few questions.

725
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:40,000
 Where in the world do you see the need for God's restoration?

726
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,720
 What breaks your heart as you look out

727
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,240
 into the community and the world around you?

728
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,040
 What has God called you to do to shape the future?

729
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,880
 And ultimately, what are you going to do about it?

730
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:59,440
 This is your God-given calling.

731
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,840
 This is what your future looks like.

732
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,640
 This is how your future works out, by doing the holy work

733
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,680
 of God's restoration.

734
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,280
 And God is ready to lead you in these things.

735
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,720
 God is standing there saying, "Here I am.

736
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,320
 Here I am."

737
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,680
 God is asking the question, "Behold, I am doing a new thing.

738
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,920
 Do you perceive it?"

739
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,720
 God is asking the question, "Are you

740
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,320
 ready to do the good works He has prepared in advance for you

741
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,840
 to do?"

742
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,920
 Our calling as followers of Jesus

743
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,120
 is to start doing this today, right now.

744
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,000
 Because for those of us who are in Christ Jesus,

745
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,280
 we have already had a taste of what this feels like, right?

746
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,200
 When you decided to give your life to Jesus,

747
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
 when you decided to surrender to Christ,

748
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,720
 you went through a renewal.

749
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,960
 Bible tells us that anyone who is in Christ,

750
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,880
 he is what?

751
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
 A new creation.

752
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,240
 The old has gone.

753
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,920
 The new has come.

754
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,000
 The new has come.

755
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,640
 So therefore, as a people who have been through renewal,

756
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,080
 our role now is to bring renewal to this world that

757
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,720
 still desperately needs it.

758
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,880
 So I'm sorry, church.

759
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,760
 I know I haven't told you clearly

760
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,160
 about what your future is going to look like.

761
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,760
 I really wish I could say to everyone

762
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,200
 that it's nothing but blue skies and sunshine up ahead.

763
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,480
 I wish I could guarantee you and your family members

764
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,840
 are going to be healthy, prosperous, and happy

765
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,640
 for the rest of their lives.

766
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,120
 I wish I could tell you that there's

767
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,280
 going to be peace in all your relationships.

768
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,840
 I wish I could tell you that you're

769
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,680
 going to meet the love of your life,

770
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,040
 have the family of your dreams.

771
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,640
 But I can't.

772
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,280
 And as we prayed for today, the fact,

773
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,840
 chances are that in the future, there's still

774
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,560
 some tough things coming along.

775
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,120
 Because the truth is, we're not yet in this new heavens

776
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,880
 and the new earth.

777
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,920
 And for the time being, they're going

778
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,440
 to be failed dreams, untimely deaths, sickness, fear,

779
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,680
 conflict, misfortune.

780
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,400
 But what I do know is this.

781
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,360
 The God who created his earth, the God we serve,

782
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,520
 the all-powerful, all-loving God who sent his son Jesus

783
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,240
 to die on the cross, who raised him from the dead,

784
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,880
 has defeated the powers of sin and death and hopelessness.

785
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,560
 And what I do know is that God has in store for you

786
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,120
 is far beyond what you can even ask or imagine.

787
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,840
 What I do know is that our God is

788
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,680
 in the process of redeeming and renewing this world.

789
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,600
 And one day, this will come into completion.

790
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,560
 What I do know, he's inviting all of us

791
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,440
 to join in with him in this process.

792
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,760
 God is leading you into a new future.

793
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,800
 Will you see it, church?

794
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,840
 Will you act upon it?

795
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,080
 Will you respond in obedience to the renewal

796
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,640
 God wants to do through you?

797
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,960
 I'm going to invite you to pray.

798
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,400
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

799
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:25,600
 And as we were preparing for the services this morning,

800
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,560
 one of the things that was mentioned was there's people

801
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,280
 I know coming to the services today

802
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,760
 who have some very specific things that they're

803
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,560
 worried about coming up.

804
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,040
 An operation, an interview, a conversation

805
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,920
 that they need to have, some big decision that

806
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
 needs to be made.

807
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,960
 Excuse me.

808
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,000
 They're searching right now for the answers.

809
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,760
 And that uncertainty is causing a lot of fear.

810
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:57,400
 And you don't know how it's going to work out.

811
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,560
 So if that's you in the room right now,

812
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,560
 if you have something specific that you know it's coming up

813
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,680
 and you know you need God's guidance in it,

814
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,560
 you know you need Him to intervene or help you

815
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,080
 in some way, I invite you to open your hands just

816
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,280
 as a sign of surrendering it to God right now.

817
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:31,520
 And as you do that, be reassured that the Lord is with you.

818
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

819
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,600
 And Jesus is for you.

820
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,160
 Holy Spirit is going to be guiding you and protecting you.

821
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,240
 The God who will walk with you through the valleys,

822
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,240
 it's the same God who will lead you to the still waters,

823
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,680
 to the green pastures.

824
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,520
 And so Father, for my brothers and sisters

825
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,680
 with their hands open right now who

826
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,240
 are anticipating something that really

827
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,920
 needs you to show them and guide them and lead them

828
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,840
 into the right thing, the good thing that they should do,

829
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,760
 Father, I pray that you would walk with them, guide them,

830
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,000
 lead them, give them strength, give them hope.

831
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,320
 And also there's some of us who have

832
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,720
 been worried about the future and perhaps

833
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,440
 have turned to some of those things that are outside of you.

834
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,480
 And it's led them to some very dark places.

835
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,320
 It's led them to trust and bind themselves

836
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,600
 to certain things that are not holy and not from you.

837
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,000
 If that's you today, you can also

838
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,480
 open up your hands right now if you

839
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,640
 feel comfortable to do that.

840
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:48,720
 Lord, and I pray that you would release them

841
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,560
 from things not of you that are binding them.

842
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,760
 Release any lies that have been spoken out

843
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,200
 over them in this process, anything that's not from you,

844
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:00,700
 Lord.

845
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:09,920
 And help them to let go of what is not from you

846
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,140
 and hold on to your love and your guidance,

847
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,080
 even though it might seem in some ways a bit more uncertain,

848
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:25,040
 a bit more murky in that way.

849
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,760
 But we know our God is for us, that he'll never

850
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,880
 lead us astray, that he'll never lead us things that he cannot

851
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,080
 continue to guide us through, because he loves us.

852
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:43,600
 And for the rest of us, Lord, use

853
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,600
 us to do the work of restoration.

854
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,720
 Lord, this world is a broken place.

855
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,920
 Our communities, our families, our schools,

856
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,880
 and people are longing for hope.

857
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,960
 People are longing for renewal.

858
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,080
 And yes, we anticipate.

859
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,280
 We can't wait for the day, Lord, you come back

860
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,000
 and everything will finally be made right once and for all.

861
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,360
 But until that day comes, Lord, give us the courage

862
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,120
 to live as that is already here, to bring your kingdom on Earth

863
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,680
 as it is in heaven.

864
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,400
 And this is the way, Lord.

865
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,680
 This is the way you've called us to live as your followers,

866
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,240
 trusting in you, building our lives on the foundation

867
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,440
 that you have set for us, and bringing your love to those

868
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,480
 who are seeking it, Lord.

869
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,360
 So we thank you for this.

870
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,120
 Walk with us, Jesus.

871
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,320
 We thank you for your love for us.

872
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,400
 And we love you too, Lord.

873
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,000
 Amen.

874
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,960
 You join me in standing with the worship team.

875
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,300
 we're gonna end our time by just singing a song together.

876
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,880
 (upbeat music)
