[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Why don't we put hands together for Benedict? It's amazing.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I especially love the soundtrack analogy.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   So, this week earlier I was editing June's video on Instagram
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   and I posted it and something was off.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   And I re-watched again, oh, I forgot to put the soundtrack there.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   So it sounds different. Although her message is still very good,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   but it still sounds a little bit different.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   So I re-uploaded it. So the soundtrack is very important.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Can we put hands together for him again for that? Yes.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Let me put this down.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   So, this is the third week of Advent.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   We are 10 days away from Christmas.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   How are you guys doing?
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Too many parties already?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   You're like, "Oh, good. Too many parties, too many wine.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   I'm so tired."
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Too many parties?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Anybody went to more than like three Christmas parties already?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Well, yeah, staff and small group and our daughter's school's
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Christmas parties were three.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Anyway, party is great. Party is good.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Nobody believes the pastor is saying, "Hey, come on."
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Parties are biblical, all right?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   You see parties in the Bible.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   As long as we are doing the, you know, we're celebrating for the
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   right thing, we're not getting wasted.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   It's biblical. Come on.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Do you know that when we get saved, there's a party going on
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   in heaven? You know that, right?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   So celebration, it's good.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's biblical.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And in fact, celebration, it's a vital part of life.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   It's so important that what we're doing here every Sunday
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   morning or afternoon, it's a celebration in itself, right?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   The songs we sing, the way we, you know, the way you clap, the
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   way we do what we do, it's part of a celebration, amen?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I'm like, okay, half of you, half agree with me.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Okay.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   All right.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I still love you.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Anyway.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So Christmas is coming.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I'm sure you've been hearing a lot of music going on.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   We did sing some Christmas songs.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And in the car, I play Christmas songs.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And fun fact, my daughter asked me to play a Christmas song a
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   couple weeks ago.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Said I want a Christmas song in the car.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I was about to reach for, you know, jingle bells or something.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And she said, I want "Last Christmas."
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   [Laughter]
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   So you know the music taste of my daughter now.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Anyway, yeah, music, it's so beautiful.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And we sang a lot of Christmas songs, a lot of songs we do,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   they are for Christmas only.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Worship team, we have a special set list for Christmas.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And in fact, in the Bible story or in the Bible narrative, when
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   you look into it, in the gospel of Luke, those chapters talking
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   about the birth of Jesus, there were indeed some songs inside.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Today we're going to talk about one of them.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And that song, it's by Mary, Jesus' mother.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Let me just read that to you in fact here.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Sorry, this is what the water is for.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Sorry.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   So we'll start from Luke 1, verse 46.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   There it says, "Mary said, 'My soul glorifies the Lord, and my
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   spirit rejoices in God my Savior.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   For he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant," me
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   basically, "from now on all generations will call me blessed.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   For the mighty one has done great things for me.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Holy is his name.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   His mercies extend to those who fear him from generation to
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   generation.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   He has performed mighty deeds with his arms.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   the humble.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   away empty.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   ancestors."
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So you probably would have heard of this before.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Some composer, they even used these words, composed music, put a
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   soundtrack to these words, and it becomes songs that we would
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   sing throughout different centuries of the church.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And we've been calling this song or this passage the "Magnificat."
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   It comes from the very first word in this passage in the Latin
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Bible.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   So this -- oh, it's on the screen.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   This "Magnificat," it's a beautiful piece.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   But if you start reading it and if you are a Bible reader, you
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   like to read, for example, the Psalms in the Old Testament when
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   you can't sleep or maybe you can sleep, you just love reading the
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Bible.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   You start reading it.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   You find a little bit of similarities.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   This Psalm started with, you know, "My soul glorifies the Lord
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   and my spirit," and my spirit does what?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   My spirit will also, you know, sing him praises.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   My spirit is also worshiping him, worship God, my Savior.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And this kind of reminds you of something like Psalm 103, right?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   You know, "Bless the Lord, O my soul," something like that.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And if we continue to read and we would see this Psalm, actually,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   it follows a certain format.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   This format in the Old Testament Psalm, one of the hymns we call
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   it, we call this kind of Psalm a "Thanksgiving Psalm," a
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   "Thanksgiving poem."
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And it always starts with a call to worship or a call to praise
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   God or in itself just a statement to praise God, like what I just
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   said, "Bless the Lord, O my soul."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   It's a statement calling myself to praise God.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   This is what Mary is doing here.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   "My soul, my soul, my soul glorifies the Lord."
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And it's like one of these old Psalms that we normally read.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And when Mary says, "My soul and my spirit," she is actually saying,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   "My very being, my whole self, I'll be here to praise God,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   to worship him, to love him, to bring glory to him."
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And that's what it is.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   But, you know, this is what we do nowadays as well.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   We have songs like this, "Bless the Lord, O my soul."
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And then, you know, we sing a lot of songs every Sunday.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   We do this every single week.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   We have praise songs.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   We praise God whenever we come into church.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   So praise is part of the routine, the activities that we do here.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And we can just follow the screen.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   There are lyrics right now, and we just follow, and we sing something.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Sometimes you feel your heart is resonating or your heart really,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   "Wow, it really makes my heart beat," you know, when I see those
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   lyrics, when I'm singing those.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Sometimes you're like, "Oh, okay.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   That's all right."
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   But for Jewish worshipers, whenever they're worshipping,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   yes, this call to worship, this statement of worship, yes,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   it's important.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   But they always have the next part in their psalm.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   And they always have a word, a transition word that sounds like,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   "For I bless the Lord, I love you, Lord.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   For you have done certain things for me."
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   They always put a reason.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   They always put a testimony of their own story to that psalm.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   They're always telling you, "I'm here to praise God.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I'm here to worship him because something he has done for me in my life."
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   In other words, praise, there's always a reason for it.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And a joy in our lives, there's always a source for our joy.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   There's always a reason for our praise, and there's always a source
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   for our joy.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   That's what the Old Testament Psalms, and we see how people worship.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   That's what they're trying to do.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   They're saying, "My praise is not empty.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   There's always a reason behind to back it up."
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   That's my question for us today.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I'm wondering when we walk through these doors, when we come and praise God,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   is there a reason behind our worship?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   We can put that slide for those words just now.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Do we have a reason for our worship?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   When we walk in, do we feel, "Wow, yes, God, I'm praising you today
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   because of this or that," or sometimes it feels like we're just going
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   through the motions?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And I know sometimes we all do that.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   We all go through the motions.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Maybe we're half awake, or maybe, you know, for me, it was Manchester United
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   that suffered a huge defeat last night.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   When I come in on Sunday morning, oh, yeah, bless the Lord, oh, my soul.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Like, oh, my gosh.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   So sometimes that happens, but I want to reassure you that if sometimes
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   you don't feel like saying those words, you don't feel you're totally connected
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   with the lyrics, it's not a sin, I just want to tell you, but that also shows us
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   that we're missing out on something.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   It's an omission.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   We're missing out on something because when these people, when the people of God
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   in the Bible, when they're praising God, they said, "There's always a reason.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I can always think of something that he has done for me in my life."
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And unless your God stopped working in your life, unless your God no longer
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   exists in your life, otherwise, there should always be a reason.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   There should always be something that he's doing in your life that gives you,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   that brings you to praise, brings you to worship him.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And so here, when we look at the Song of Mary, the Magnificat, we can see that
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   this song, she starts with, "My soul glorifies the Lord.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   I bless him.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I praise him, and for he has done great things for me."
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   But she didn't just stop there.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   She didn't just stop with her own personal story, what God has done for me.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   She goes on and on and on to talk about the character of God.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   And throughout this song, you would see God is mighty, he's powerful,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   but he's also merciful.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   He said he will have mercy on those who fear him, like he draws near to us,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   that he will be good to us.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   He knows what we're going through, and he will not abandon us.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   So God is powerful.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   He is merciful.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   But then at the same time, she also shows us that we have a God who is just.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   In him, we find justice.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And justice in the biblical world, it means God is going to lift up the
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   humble, and he's going to humble those who are proud, something we explored
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   in a previous sermon series.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And you can go back and listen to that again, and that's our God.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   That's what he's doing.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And so when we look at Mary's song, we see that she starts with calling us
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   and calling herself to worship, and then she moved on to giving a very
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   reason why she's worshiping God right now, why she's praising with her own
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   story what God has done for her.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And she talks about what God has done for all her people, how that shows
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   God's character.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And we see that there's a great reversal that we have seen, what we talked
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   about, he will bring down those rulers from their thrones, he will lift up
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   the humble, and we see that's what God's going to do.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   For Mary, that's something she experienced very personally, because she
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   knows she was a nobody.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   She's from a nobody town called Nazareth, and she's a nobody there.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   If God choose to come into this world as a baby, probably he should have
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   choose someone more prominent, someone more like her relative Elizabeth,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   or maybe when she was a bit younger, because Elizabeth is a bit old now,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   but somebody who looks perfect, who has a perfect record, who comes from a
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   great family, maybe those people should be the ones who carry this baby Jesus
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   or the Messiah.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   But Mary knew, wow, God is going to come here and turn everything upside
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   down.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And it's not just for Mary, it's not just for herself, that's for the entire
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   world, because the kingdom of God that this baby inside of her womb, Jesus, he
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   came to establish is an upside-down kingdom.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   It's to reverse the world order, it's to turn things upside down, and that's
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   what Mary was trying to communicate to us in this song.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   It's beautiful, it's biblical.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   We read about that Jesus talked about this kind of stuff.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   But today I want to draw your attention to one particular line of this song.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Mary says this, "From now on, all generations will call me blessed."
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I know, we're here sitting in 2024, we look back this story in the Bible from
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   2,000 years ago, I'm like, "Yeah, of course, Mary, of course you're blessed.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Come on, you're the mother of Jesus."
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And in some areas, there are people who would even say prayers to you, and you're
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   in a place where everybody celebrates you at least every Christmas we talk about
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   you.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   I remember as a young kid when I was in my church, I was a four or five-year-old
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   kid, they made us do a Christmas play, and I think I was Joseph, and I learned
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   about Joseph and Mary there, and I was like four or five.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Even young kids know about her.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Of course you're blessed, what are you talking about?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Of course that's true if we look at that story from a 2024 perspective.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   But today I want to bring us back to the first century.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   I want to bring us back to the time and space where this story actually happened.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   You know that this story happened about 2,000 years ago in Middle East in an
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   area called Judea.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   So Jewish people, they have their own customs, they have their own laws, they
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   have their own religious laws.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   When Mary, when the angel one day show up to her and say, "Hey, you know what,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Mary?
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   You're going to get pregnant because God loves you.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   You're going to get pregnant.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Yes, I know you're not married yet, but don't worry, you're going to get
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   pregnant."
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   What?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   "Don't worry, you're going to get pregnant, okay?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Because God loves you, he favors you, you're going to get pregnant."
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   If I were Mary, honestly I would freak out.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   I'm like, "What are you talking about?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Oh, no."
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Because like some parts of the world, maybe in a city among the more Chinese
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   culture, it's still true.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   If you're unmarried and you're pregnant, it's actually a big deal.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   In the Jewish culture, any unmarried pregnancy, it's considered a sin.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   And the Jewish law is actually punishable by death.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Of course, during that time, nobody really does that anymore, but it's still
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   a big sin.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   So you get rejected by your husband or your fiance, you get rejected by your
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   own family, your own father, and those synagogue leaders, those Pharisees,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   they will brand you as a sinner.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   It sounds familiar, we talked about that a couple of weeks ago.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   You will become a sinner, you will become an outcast of the society from now on.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Nobody wants to do business with you, nobody wants to talk to you, nobody wants
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   to stay near you.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   People, when they see you, "Oh, okay, hi, I'm sorry."
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   They will just run away from you.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Nobody would want to be with you anymore.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   That's what we're talking about here.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   If you said, you know, "Mission Impossible," you say yes to this mission,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   if you say yes to it, you're going to be an outcast for the rest of your life.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Nobody is going to have, won't have anything to do with you.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   That was what Mary facing during that time.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And so when this angel showed up, when the angel broke the news to her,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   when she said, "I'm the Lord's servant," there is a prize there.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   There's a huge prize indeed.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And today I want to continue to read with us a few verses before that song.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   I'm going to read from Luke 1, verse 39.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   It says, so 38, that's the end of the angel, Gabriel, bringing that message to her.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Verse 39 says this, "At that time, Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   of Judea, where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth."
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   So Mary, she lives in Nazareth in Galilee, and she's going to this place,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   a hill country of Judea.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   That's about 80 to 110 kilometers, give or take.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   If you start your journey here from Yuen Long and walk for 110 kilometers,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   you probably, one of the possible places you would end up in, it's Guangzhou.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Of course now, as Hong Kongers, we take the high-speed rail, you'll be there in less than an hour.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   But we're talking about 2,000 years ago.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   We're talking about this rural area, so she would have to walk all the way there,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   and she could only take this journey by herself.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And we're seeing that she's actually not in a good mood to do a road trip.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   We think, oh yeah, there's a relative, let's go and visit her.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   That's what we do sometimes, right?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Okay, I'm going back home to see my family, you know?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   See you in a few weeks, bye, that's Christmas, that's what everybody does.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   That's not what Mary is doing.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   She's not doing a road trip to see her friends or relatives or family.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   It's not a pleasant trip for her.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Maybe, in fact, while she was traveling, she's asking herself a lot of questions.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   She got a lot of things going on in her mind, things like,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   "What am I going to say to my family when they find out eventually?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   What should I tell Joseph?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Will he even believe me?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Will he even try to listen to me if I tell him I got a baby,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   and that baby is from the Holy Spirit, you know?
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Will he even listen to me?"
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   You see, when Mary was on her way to see Elizabeth,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   she probably might be filled with confusion and questions and different emotions
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   all mixed up inside of her.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   That shocking news from the angel would probably have disoriented her life
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   or even turned her life upside down.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   As a teenager, she had to face a challenge that she would have never imagined before.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   As I was reading this story, I was actually wondering in my head,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   "Did Mary take this trip before or after the angel Gabriel appeared to Joseph in Matthew 1?"
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   If you know the story in Matthew 1, the angel actually appeared to Joseph
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   to tell him the same message because before the angel visited Joseph,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   he was actually thinking about divorcing Mary, saying, "Sorry, this is over.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   I don't understand. You mean you're pregnant?
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   We're not married. How can this happen?
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   You must be with another man. Sorry, Mary. I like you.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   You're cute. You're great. And you're beautiful.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   But you're pregnant. So I'm sorry. This is the end."
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   And the Bible says he wants to do it quietly.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   He wants to say, like, "Goodbye. That's it.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Let's break up. Last Christmas, I gave you my heart, but that's it.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   All right?"
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   So my guess is, my guess, the Bible didn't say this timeline,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   but my guess is that this trip was even before Joseph found out.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Because number one, there's no ultrasound in those days.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And number two, for a girl even to find herself pregnant, to confirm her pregnancy,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I have two kids, so I know.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   It takes at least like a month or a few more weeks when your period stops
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   and you start to wonder and you check.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   I don't know how they do it before, like, all these--
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Yeah, anyway, I don't know about technology in first century,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   but it would at least take a few weeks or at least a few months for her to find out.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   But she took this trip immediately to visit Elizabeth.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   So perhaps she hasn't even thought about how to talk to Joseph yet.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   She's just, you know, raising herself, her heart, like, "What am I going to do?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   What am I going to say? What am I going to tell him?"
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   So this is where Mary was.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Maybe she hasn't even thought about how to talk to him.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Maybe, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   And yeah, of course, if you read the Bible in the Old Testament,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   there is a prophecy in one of the prophets, Isaiah.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   It says there will be a virgin giving birth to a kid.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   If you take--if Mary take this prophecy to Joseph, to his family,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   I have imagined that, you know, as a father myself,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   I do believe in God's power that could be a virgin giving birth to a child,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   but that would not be my daughter.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   As a brother myself, I could totally believe that by God's power
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   there could be a virgin giving birth to a child, just not my sister.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   As someone's ex-fiancé, because I'm a husband,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   as an ex-fiancé, I could believe that God could miraculously make a virgin,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   you know, give birth to a baby, but just not my fiancé.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   You get what I mean?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Yeah, there could be a miracle, but that miracle wouldn't be in my home.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   This is what Mary was facing.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   The rejection, the scandal, the way people look at her,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   the way people are rejecting her, don't want to have anything to do with her.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   That's what Mary was facing.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Being an unmarried, pregnant teenager in the first century Jewish society
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   could be the worst nightmare.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   It brings shame to her.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   It brings shame to her family.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   She'll be rejected by Joseph, by her father, by her synagogue community,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   and for the rest of her life she's going to be branded as a sinner.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And because in the first century Jewish community, you know what?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Women, their social status, their economic status
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   is totally dependent on her family or her husband.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And so if she's unmarried, she's pregnant,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   she didn't just mess up her social life or her self-esteem.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   We're talking about her livelihood.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   We're talking about every possible area in her life will be affected.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   So if there's a simple way to describe the situation Mary was in,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   she was simply in a crisis with her unmarried pregnancy.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   And not only that, later because of this child of hers,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   after this child was born, you know, she was rejected by other people as well.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Because of this pregnancy, when she was in Bethlehem,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   when she was supposed to follow her fiancé to his hometown,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   they were rejected.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   They couldn't even find a place to stay,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   and they had to give birth in an animal shelter.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   And after this child was born, because this child was being hunted down,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   they end up, this family end up as refugees in a country they had never lived in.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   They become refugees.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And not only that, when this kid finally, you know, grew up,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   she had to watch him being tortured to death, horrible death.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   She had to watch it with her own eyes.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   And if we add all these things up and you tell me,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   "From now on, all generations will call me blessed,"
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I think that doesn't quite add up to the math.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   If you're telling me that's how God is going to bless me or bless you,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   I don't know about you.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Probably I'll say, "Pass. I don't want to be blessed like that.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   I don't want to be blessed in a way that I'll have to go through pain,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   I'll have to go through suffering, I'll have to see a loved one die,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   I'll have to be rejected many, many times."
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   I don't even know if that's blessing.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   How about you?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   What do you see as blessings of God in your life?
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Is it possible in this scenario, if we look at it and we think about our lives,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   would there be any scenario that God is actually blessing us,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   but we simply miss it because we thought,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   "No way, God cannot bless someone like that."
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Would we be passing God's blessings without knowing and said,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   "Sorry, I don't want this, I don't want this,"
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   but in fact, it's God's blessing in our life.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   But what changed?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Like if she's going through so much suffering,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   if she's going through so much trauma or so much stress
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   while she was on her way to see Elizabeth,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   what has changed in that house that Mary suddenly said,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   "You know what? From now on, all generations are going to call me blessed."
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   So why don't we find out what happened in that house of Zechariah and Elizabeth.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   I'm going to read from verse 41.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   "When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby, John the Baptist, inside her womb leaped,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   In a loud voice she exclaimed, 'Blessed are you among women!
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Blessed is the child you will bear!
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   But why am I so favored that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill His promises to her."
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   It's beautiful here. It says, "Elizabeth, she was filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   and being inspired by the Holy Spirit, she recognized who the baby in the womb was."
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   It's interesting because the Holy Spirit has always been the one that points us to Jesus.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   The Holy Spirit has always been the one that reveals Jesus to us.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   This is the first person being filled with the Holy Spirit in the New Testament,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   and her first reaction, she recognized Jesus.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   "Oh, that's Jesus. Oh, that's the Messiah.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   That's the mother of the Messiah, the mother of my Lord coming to me."
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   She recognized.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And because she knew who the baby was, so she said those words, "Blessed are you among women."
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   In today's terms, you are like not greatest of all time, you're the most blessed of all time.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   So if you can come up with a meme like that, that's Mary,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   and she's the most blessed of all time.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   She's the most blessed woman of all time.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   That's what she meant.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   And what? All right, memes, right?
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Okay, and said, "Oh, yeah, this will be my Lord."
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   And so Mary, Mary, we have to look at Mary.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   She has experienced this blessing, but there are actually, according to the words of Elizabeth,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   this blessing, there are two parts.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   So the first part, of course, is that baby is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   The Holy Spirit came and she become pregnant,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   and that's her blessing because of the baby inside of her womb.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   That's why she's blessed.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   But you know that part, she doesn't have to do a thing.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   She just sit there, do nothing, and "I'm pregnant."
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   She doesn't have to do anything.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Completely passive in this part of the blessing.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   But then Elizabeth also talk about an active part in this blessing.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   She said, "Blessed is the one who believed that the Lord will fulfill his promises to her."
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   In other words, when the angel came, Mary, she believed.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   She believed the promises of God, no matter how difficult it seems,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   no matter how crazy it sounds, she believed that God is gonna do something.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   And that belief, that trust, that faith becomes a blessing in her life.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And so those who continue to believe, who continue to trust,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   who continue to hold on to God's promises, just like Mary, they will be blessed.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   But this is very important here.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   When Elizabeth declared these words over her, she was filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I don't know if you've ever been in a room or in a situation where someone was filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   and they just start praying for you, they're just speaking over your life,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   they start prophesying over you.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   I've had that in a Zoom call before, I've had that face to face before,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I've had that in many different scenarios before.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   You know, what I learned is that when someone is filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   and they're speaking life over me or speaking God's words over me,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   the only thing I felt was, "Oh, I have a direct encounter with God."
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   I think Mary, when she left Nazareth, she was totally puzzled, she was totally confused.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   But when she arrived in that house, when Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   and started prophesying over her, I think she had an encounter with God
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and things started to change.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   The confusion was gone and she was like, "Now I know my soul glorifies the Lord
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   and now generations will call me blessed.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Whatever is going to happen to me, I know I'm blessed."
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   A visitation of the Holy Spirit, a word, a ministry from the Holy Spirit
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   changed the entire scenario.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   And I'm wondering if, you know, we need that in our lives.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   We need the Holy Spirit to speak to us either directly or through someone,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   speak over us so that something inside of our lives, maybe some strongholds,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   maybe some previous hurts, maybe something stuck inside us could be changed.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Some of us, some of you here have heard of my story or more correctly, my mother's story.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   She found out she had cancer not long after she gave birth to me, so I was still very young.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And some of you knew that she passed away eventually because of cancer.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   But what I didn't share with you all was that my mother actually passed on my third birthday.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   I remember as a kid on Tomb Sweeping Festival, all those double nines like Chinese festival
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   will go tomb sweeping.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   I remember arriving at my mom's gravestone and looking at a date.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   That date was supposed to be my birthday.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   It's supposed to be a date for celebration, but then that date has ever since been turned
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   into a date for mourning.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   In fact, when I was young, my family never celebrated my birthday with me on the actual date.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Well, my birthday was right after a major holiday, so we always just do it by the way
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   and let's just celebrate, have a party during the holiday, but we never do it on my actual birthday.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Ever since I was young, I thought when I look at that day, I always approach that day with mourning,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   with sadness, with, "Oh, this is a bad day.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   I don't like this date.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   This is so bad," because my mom left the world and she lost her life on this date.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Fast forward, I remember on my 18th birthday, I was just praying and worshipping at home.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   I was just singing songs to praise God and I was praying, and somehow, I don't know why,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   I thought about this part, my mom and the Holy Spirit just came into my bedroom
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   and He started speaking to me.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   He said, "Chapman, you know what?
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   15 years ago this date, yes, it was the day that your mom passed away,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   but that was actually the day that she finished running her good race.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   It was the day she finished fighting the good fight.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   It was the day that she has kept her faith and now, she would receive the crown of life
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and the entire heaven was cheering for her.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   That's what happened 15 years ago.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   If there's something you need to react to, if there's a proper reaction, that would be celebration."
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   The Spirit just came upon me and I remember for the first time, I started celebrating that.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Not just my birthday, not just my birth, but I started celebrating the end of my mother's life on my birthday
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   because I know what her life actually meant, not just to me or my family,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   but to all those people she helped during her time.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   I know she fought this good fight, so it's a time worth celebrating because that's the day she said,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   it's kind of like Olympics, she got on stage and somebody gave her a medal.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   That's the exact moment.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   If there's something I should do, I should be standing there giving her a round of applause.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And that day, the Holy Spirit just came and spoke to me and changed my heart.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And ever since, for the next almost 20 years now, I do celebrate that.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   I do celebrate my birthday, but above all, I celebrate the day my mom,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   which we say graduated from this life or she finished her mission here,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   and she entered into eternity.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   That's beautiful.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   [Applause]
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Thank you.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   As I was preparing the message for today, I felt that's what the Holy Spirit wants to do with us today.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Perhaps some of us, we are struggling with certain things in our lives.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Perhaps there are wounds He wants to heal.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   There are strongholds He wants to take down.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   There are things He wants to speak to us directly or maybe through somebody else.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   He wants to speak life into us.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   I do want to give us room and space and time just to be in the presence of God,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   in the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   When Mary left Nazareth, I think she was quite puzzled.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I think she was quite nervous, but that encounter with God in Zechariah, in Elizabeth's house,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   I think it changed her.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   I think one encounter with God can do a lot in our lives.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And I believe that's what God wants to do this morning here or this afternoon here with us.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   This is what we're going to do.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   We're just going to--you can sit, you can stand.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   We're just going to worship God for a bit.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   And then later I'll give us some instructions on how we're going to pray.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   So if you want to stand, you can stand.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   If you want to sit, you can sit.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   But we're just going to worship right now.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   [music]
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Holy Spirit, we invite you.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   We welcome you.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   We open our hearts to you today, Lord.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Whether we're like Mary, perhaps there are things in our lives that you want to come and bless us,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   you want to come and speak to us, you want to come and release a word of life over us.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Perhaps today here some of us will be like, "Elizabeth, you are going to fill us with your Spirit and you're going to speak through us.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   We're going to be your mouthpiece today."
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Holy Spirit, I just welcome you.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   I just pray that you will come and fill us right now.
