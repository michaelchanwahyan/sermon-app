1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,360
 Yes, we have been listening to the story of Joseph.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,080
 So many people say that you can choose your friends, but you can't choose your family.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,840
 But actually, God can do that.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,200
 And he did.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,880
 He intentionally selected his own family from the very beginning.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,720
 And through his divine providence, he guided this family to bring forth a savior for his

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,000
 people.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,600
 The last two weeks, we look at the Genesis chapter 37.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,480
 It establishes the family of Jacob, the 12 brothers.

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:54,640
 And also, it tells us about the story of Joseph, that he was sold to Egypt.

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:07,280
 If you look back at chapter 37, the last verse of 36, and also if you turn to chapter 39,

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:16,720
 the beginning verse 1, when you look at these two verses, you can find it is almost identical.

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:25,640
 One can actually skip chapter 38, but we don't.

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,760
 Because it is more than about the story of Joseph.

16
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,880
 It is about the generations of Joseph's father, Jacob.

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:49,200
 And it's also about Jacob's family, how God is so faithful to bring his people out of

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,920
 those prisons.

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,180
 And also, it is God that is faithful to bless his people after Jacob.

20
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:09,300
 And it's about God working behind the scenes through this messy family to build up a nation

21
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,260
 as he promised.

22
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:20,940
 So for chapter 38, seems like an odd story in the larger plot of Joseph's narrative.

23
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:29,060
 And then suddenly, it turns to a detour to show a moment in the life of Judah and Tamar.

24
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,900
 So these are the two main characters in chapter 38.

25
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,380
 And we have a sermon outline here for this slide, yes.

26
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:50,380
 When we will talk about Judah's unrighteousness, Tamar's righteousness, and also for Judah's

27
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,620
 redemption.

28
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:00,460
 So for these two main characters here, Tamar, she is the daughter-in-law of Judah.

29
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:07,780
 And with her immoral but tragic circumstances, she was given the honor of being the first

30
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,620
 woman included in Jesus' genealogy.

31
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:22,180
 And Judah was one of the sons of Jacob by his first wife, Leah.

32
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,820
 And of course, Judah was not as lucky as Joseph.

33
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,620
 He did not really have the favor and attention and love from his father.

34
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:42,180
 And his father, Jacob, did not like, did not love his mother, actually.

35
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:52,860
 So under these circumstances, Judah's mother, Leah, constantly endured rejection and inhumanization

36
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,420
 in her marriage.

37
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,620
 In Hebrew, Judah means thanksgiving or praise.

38
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:06,740
 The name was given under the circumstances in which he was born.

39
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:15,780
 Leah's heart changed and turned all her attention away from her pain and bitterness.

40
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,900
 And she decided to name her fourth son, Judah, means praise.

41
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:29,260
 A sacrifice of praise to God in the midst of difficult situation.

42
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:36,700
 So as we trace the character development from the beginning, it is quite a miraculous journey

43
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:44,700
 This is one of the stories that won't get included in the children Bible stories.

44
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,180
 Because it is a little graphic and juicy.

45
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:59,420
 In chapter 38, it spends about 20 years before the narrative returns to Joseph, continuing

46
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,940
 his story in chapter 39 to 50.

47
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,380
 So we're going to see the change in Judah at the end of this chapter.

48
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:18,860
 How God took him from a man who did not really care about his family or doing what was right,

49
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:27,700
 to the one who was willing to sacrifice to keep the family of God together at all costs.

50
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:34,620
 And through Tamar, Judah learned what it meant to do right for God's people.

51
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:45,380
 The child born of Tamar by Judah ends up being the next link in the lineage of the Messiah.

52
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:53,360
 And that's why the transformation of Judah here is so important as it is so woven with

53
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,640
 Joseph's story, which we will see later on.

54
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:07,880
 So please rest assured that God has a purpose to use this story to teach us some lessons.

55
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,280
 So are you ready?

56
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:25,360
 In the beginning of chapter 38, Judah apparently left his home after Joseph was sold to Egypt.

57
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,020
 Actually Judah was the one that suggests this idea and all the other brothers agreed.

58
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,660
 So Joseph was sold.

59
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,540
 So he moved to a town called Adenam.

60
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,020
 And here he met a lady.

61
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,500
 She is Canaanite and Judah married her.

62
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,460
 This fact is mentioned in passing, but it is important.

63
00:06:52,460 --> 00:07:02,140
 There was a history in the family of not intermarrying with the Canaanites due to their pagan tendencies.

64
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:12,840
 Abraham and Isaac make it very clear to their sons, they should not marry Canaanite women.

65
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,120
 But unfortunately, Judah did.

66
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,860
 He and his wife have three children, Ur, Owen, and Shelah.

67
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,460
 When Ur grew up, he married a woman called Tamar.

68
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:35,100
 Tamar, we presume, she also came from a Canaanite family.

69
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,480
 And unfortunately, Ur was a very evil man.

70
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:49,260
 The Bible didn't say how wicked he was, but he was so wicked that so much that God took

71
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,660
 his life.

72
00:07:52,660 --> 00:08:00,740
 And then Owen, the next oldest son, was supposed to marry and have a child with Tamar.

73
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,280
 This son would be recognized as the son of Ur rather than his own.

74
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:14,300
 It was a custom and also a practice in the Asian Near East, which would be later codified

75
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:21,460
 in the law of Moses, which was called the law of leverage marriage.

76
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:28,860
 If a man died without a child, his brother was to marry the widow, and the first son

77
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:35,420
 was regarded as the descendant of the deceased man.

78
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:42,220
 So bearing no children was a source of shame of any woman in the old days.

79
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,060
 Women have no power and have to depend on men.

80
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:54,440
 They could not inherit the land or the wealth of the husbands if he died.

81
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:02,140
 So having a son was very helpful to protect the widow, and the son would now become the

82
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,220
 heir, and she could be secure.

83
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:15,100
 Owen apparently married Tamar, but he did not want to give his brother a child.

84
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,460
 Owen acted in his own interest instead of doing what was right.

85
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:28,100
 He simply used Tamar for sex, but prevented her from getting pregnant.

86
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:35,380
 And because of his sin, Owen's life was also taken away by God.

87
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:44,740
 Now two of Judah's sons died and have been killed after marrying Tamar.

88
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,460
 Judah probably was very superstitious about that.

89
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,980
 Maybe she was cursed?

90
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,860
 He was so afraid of Tamar being, in Chinese we say, "hag fu."

91
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,540
 It means it brings bad luck or death to the husband.

92
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:10,980
 So he was very concerned about sending his last and the youngest son, Shelah, to her

93
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,940
 for fear that he too would die.

94
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:22,660
 And Judah probably didn't know why his two sons were drop dead.

95
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:31,100
 The only thing he knew, well, the two sons married Tamar and they died.

96
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:39,740
 So in verses 11, Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Live as a widow in your father's

97
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:48,500
 household until my son Shelah grows up, for he thought he may die too, just like his brothers."

98
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,980
 So Tamar went to live in her father's household.

99
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:02,220
 You see, it would be such a disgrace for Tamar to go back home to his father's house and

100
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,140
 wait there.

101
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:10,700
 But she has no choice and left with a false hope.

102
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:18,660
 Judah made Tamar believe he would eventually send his last son to her.

103
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,460
 But actually, he has no plans to do so.

104
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,740
 He was just trying to deceive her and trying to get rid of her.

105
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,700
 Wow.

106
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,820
 Poor Tamar.

107
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:40,900
 We don't know the exact timeline of the story, but sometime later, Shelah was old enough

108
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:51,460
 to marry and it was so obvious to Tamar that Judah wasn't going to keep his promise.

109
00:11:51,460 --> 00:12:00,500
 But Tamar's end goal as a widow, as a woman, as Judah's daughter-in-law, is to preserve

110
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:08,180
 the family line of Judah so the inheritance and the blessings of God's covenant could

111
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,180
 continue.

112
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:21,060
 Tamar was so desperate, hopeless, helpless, and lonely without children and provision.

113
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,740
 Last Sunday, Pastor Chapman talked about how Joseph was stuck in the pit.

114
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:34,980
 Likewise, Tamar was also stuck in this family's pit.

115
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,180
 She's simply at the mercy of Judah.

116
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:45,700
 And yet, it's the mercy that Judah refused to give to her.

117
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,700
 He denied Tamar a life and a future.

118
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,100
 So what happened to Tamar was an injustice.

119
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,840
 She was mistreated badly.

120
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:02,620
 She was ultimately facing the reality of being forgotten.

121
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:12,380
 However, she refused to let others define her and she decided to take this matter into

122
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,180
 her own hands.

123
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,420
 And around that time, Judah's wife died.

124
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:31,140
 And after the mourning period, Tamar knew that he had made plans to visit his old friend.

125
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:38,180
 So what she was going to do, she changed out her clothing that identified her as a widow

126
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:44,000
 and then changed into clothing that made her look different.

127
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,120
 She took a place along the roadside where she knew Judah would pass by.

128
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:59,440
 Sure enough, before Judah came that way, the reaction or the interaction between Judah

129
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:07,560
 and Tamar was remarkably devoid of romance.

130
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,480
 Let's read verses 15.

131
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:19,840
 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face, not realizing

132
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:27,360
 that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, "Come

133
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,240
 now, let me sleep with you."

134
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,280
 "And what will you give me to sleep with you?" she asked.

135
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,640
 "I send you a young goat from my flock.

136
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,920
 Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?"

137
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,040
 "Hmm, what pledge should I give you?"

138
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,560
 "Your seal is caught and the staff in your hand."

139
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,260
 So Judah gave them to her and slept with her.

140
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,520
 And she became pregnant by him.

141
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:14,960
 After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow's clothes again.

142
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:24,880
 The seal that Judah gave Tamar was probably his ring, used for impressing his signature

143
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,040
 in the clay tablets of the time.

144
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,240
 And it was worn on a cord around the neck.

145
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,440
 And the staff was often carved with some identifying symbol of its owner.

146
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:49,560
 So what Judah gave Tamar was like in the present day, like an ID card or a passport, which

147
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:56,980
 was a very unique item as a defining mark of its owner.

148
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,000
 It was quite shocking.

149
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,520
 Judah could lightly forfeit his possessions.

150
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:13,520
 He easily just gave up his possessions for the sake of a moment of lust.

151
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:23,280
 And three months later, when Tamar was found to be pregnant, Judah was outraged and demanded

152
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:33,280
 her to put her to death by burning her for the shame she has brought to the family.

153
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,560
 Church, can you see the double standard of Judah here?

154
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:46,760
 It's so easy to accuse and point the fingers to others of wrongdoing, isn't it?

155
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:53,440
 This kind of double standard is very common in our society.

156
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:02,160
 Jesus said in Luke, "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eyes and

157
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,960
 pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?"

158
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,000
 Judah had made his daughter-in-law pregnant.

159
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,440
 He did not even care or want to ask what had happened to her.

160
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:25,800
 He condemned her, even though he was just as guilty, shameful, and unfaithful by not

161
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,560
 sending the last son to her.

162
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:40,000
 Judah possibly sensed this is a wonderful opportunity to get rid of Tamar, such an ominous

163
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 person, once and for all, to execute her.

164
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:55,160
 Well, he didn't seem to have a problem walking down the road and recruiting a prostitute

165
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,760
 three months ago.

166
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,000
 And actually, he is the one that has shamed the family by not leading them in the ways

167
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,360
 of righteousness.

168
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,840
 And now, suddenly, it was Tamar's action, punishable by death.

169
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:20,000
 He should have said, "Oh, excuse me, burn me too."

170
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,240
 And like Judah, here we are often quick to condemn others.

171
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,320
 And while at the same time overlooking our own sin, we may be holding a standard for

172
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,400
 someone else while living a completely different way.

173
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:49,000
 We have a tendency to downplay or fail to recognize our own wrongdoing while being more

174
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,700
 critical to others.

175
00:18:52,700 --> 00:19:01,920
 May God help us to open our eyes, to raise our awareness, promote greater empathy, and

176
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:10,560
 make a conscious effort to treat everyone fairly, regardless of their gender, background,

177
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,000
 or social status, et cetera.

178
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,040
 So let's move on.

179
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:27,040
 Verse 25, she was being brought out to send a message to her father-in-law, "I'm pregnant

180
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,440
 by the man who owns this," she said.

181
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:38,880
 And she added, "See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are."

182
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,440
 Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't give her

183
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:53,320
 my son, Sheleh, and he did not sleep with her again."

184
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:00,200
 Before Tamar was burned, she delivered some shocking news.

185
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:07,200
 She's pregnant by the man who gave her this seal, cord, and staff.

186
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,400
 And of course, immediately Judah recognized his personal items.

187
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:20,920
 In God, he didn't say, "Oh, I'm lonely," or "Oh, my wife died," you know?

188
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,320
 Or Tamar, "Why did you trick me?"

189
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:33,920
 Instead of justifying his own actions or making excuses, at that moment, Judah had a clear

190
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,420
 realization of what had happened.

191
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:46,520
 And because of his sin in not fulfilling his promise to Tamar, and his sin in engaging

192
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:54,640
 a prostitute, he confessed that Tamar was more righteous than he was.

193
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,640
 Yes, she was.

194
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:05,920
 And you see, Tamar was the only one that was so cared about the family line of Judah, far

195
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,680
 more than anybody else.

196
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,120
 She risked her life.

197
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,580
 She risked her life in her own expenses.

198
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:24,280
 And she hold fast to the promise that were given to this family.

199
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:33,680
 Tamar displayed such an ordinary act of faith, determination, and courage.

200
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:43,200
 Like Tamar, are we willing to put our trust in God when we face challenge and stand up

201
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:57,080
 for what is right for others and for ourselves, and to seek justice?

202
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:03,200
 God allowed Tamar to achieve triumph over this situation.

203
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,120
 Not only God cared about her, God loved her.

204
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,320
 God knew her situation.

205
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,920
 God produced much good out of what has been a great evil.

206
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,560
 Church, we all have a role in God's story.

207
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:29,920
 Can we maintain our faith and resilience in God's plan and purpose when we do not understand

208
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,760
 our hardship?

209
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,160
 The Bible accurately records what people did.

210
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:48,880
 Certain behaviors appearing in the Bible does not mean God endorses these behaviors.

211
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,920
 Both Judah and Tamar engaged in a sinful activity.

212
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,520
 But sin is not really the heart of the story.

213
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,240
 Sin is not a surprise.

214
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:18,480
 When sin is exposed and thrown under the spotlight, what happened in the next instance is important.

215
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:30,120
 Acknowledging Tamar's righteousness and his wrongdoing was the first step in Judah's transformation.

216
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:41,160
 In this moment of realizing and in this moment of brokenness, Judah has repented and God

217
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,480
 redeemed him.

218
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:55,200
 Judah's life provides an example of how God can transform and use anybody, any of

219
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,680
 us for his purpose.

220
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:08,160
 In verses 26, the scripture here said, "And he did not sleep with her again," implying

221
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:15,480
 that Judah did not take advantage of her situation for his own gain.

222
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:23,480
 But instead, he respected Tamar and provided for her as a family.

223
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,280
 Repentance is not just acknowledging, "Oh, I did wrong.

224
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,200
 I was wrong."

225
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:40,320
 Not only that, it involves turning away from our wrongdoing and starting to live a brand

226
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:47,640
 new life, to live a different life.

227
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:57,200
 God transformed an act steeped in such immorality into an extraordinary blessing, demonstrating

228
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,800
 his amazing work of providence and redemption.

229
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:12,280
 Later, we will see in chapter 44, Judah was willing to give up his freedom, even his own

230
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:18,160
 life to rescue his brother Benjamin.

231
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,160
 And the tribe of Judah was the largest.

232
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:29,520
 And he, the tribe of Judah, was the leader of the other 11 tribes.

233
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:37,240
 And he was also privileged, being part of the lineage of the Messiah.

234
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,880
 Judah's name was written on the gates of the heavenly Jerusalem, according to the book

235
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,640
 of Revelation.

236
00:25:47,640 --> 00:26:04,120
 Church, we live in the days when the behavior of Judah and Tamar are very, very common.

237
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,760
 But there's no restriction of God doing what he intends to do.

238
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:20,800
 We can look at Judah and Tamar and easily write them off as lost causes, worthless to

239
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,440
 be used by God.

240
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:33,780
 But God, with his mercy and grace, worked and transformed their lives and used such

241
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:42,400
 a black mark in their lives to become an agent of blessings for God, for their family, and

242
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,200
 for others in the future.

243
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:58,360
 So the book of Genesis, chapter 38, here it reminds us that there is a hope for all sinners.

244
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:06,960
 God's loving kindness often comes through confronting our ugliness and allowing us so

245
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,280
 honestly see our wrongdoing.

246
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,960
 And this humble us, this reveal our need.

247
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,320
 We are so much to need our Savior.

248
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:29,880
 We are so much need for his forgiveness, his mercy, for his grace, and for his redemption.

249
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:37,460
 And these are such beautiful gifts God always ready to offer to us.

250
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,640
 And God blesses us beyond what we deserve.

251
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,680
 And he is ready.

252
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,640
 Are you ready?

253
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,040
 pray.
