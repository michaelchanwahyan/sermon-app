1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
 - Man, it's hard for me to express, two weeks ago,

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,940
 two weeks ago here when I last spoke

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,940
 as part of our Exodus series was probably the most intense,

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,660
 most vulnerable, most personal,

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,380
 most overwhelming and emotional,

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,300
 but also the most pastoral, I think,

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,900
 service that my wife, Chris, and I have ever experienced

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,100
 together here at The Vine.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,860
 And as we opened up the vulnerability of our journey,

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,580
 of infertility, and as Chris in particular,

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,460
 profoundly spoke of her experience with God

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,780
 through that journey, so many of you were so pastoral

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,380
 towards us and reached out to us,

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,820
 and we're so grateful for that.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,300
 And we kind of knew heading into that week,

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,460
 it was gonna be an intense week,

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,260
 because chapter five that we were looking at that week

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,300
 is an intense chapter.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,740
 It's perhaps the most intense chapter

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,940
 of the whole Exodus journey itself.

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,020
 It's a chapter where Moses and Aaron,

22
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,980
 with the wind of the spirit behind them

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,580
 and all of the support of Israel,

24
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,300
 go before Pharaoh for the first time

25
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,500
 and say to Pharaoh with so much confidence,

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,700
 "Let our people go,"

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,540
 expecting that Pharaoh is gonna go, "Good idea."

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,420
 And Pharaoh turns to them and says,

29
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,220
 "I don't know this, God.

30
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,300
 "Why would I let you go?

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,420
 "You're my slaves.

32
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,900
 "You're part of the economy here.

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,500
 "We couldn't survive without you.

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,340
 "That's not happening.

35
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,940
 "In fact, I'm gonna punish you

36
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,140
 "for even suggesting that I'm gonna let you go."

37
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,580
 And he places them under even more slavery,

38
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,300
 even harsher conditions.

39
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,860
 And not surprisingly, Israel revolts against Moses and Aaron.

40
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,700
 "What are you doing?

41
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,860
 "Why have you done this to us?"

42
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,380
 And then Moses, at the end of chapter five,

43
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,420
 goes before God and says,

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,500
 "God, why are you doing this to me?

45
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,540
 "Like I thought things were gonna go well now.

46
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,860
 "You had called us, you had promised us,

47
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,860
 "and I thought things were gonna happen, and it hasn't.

48
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,060
 "Why have things gotten worse

49
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,340
 "before they've gotten to get better?"

50
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,340
 And we talked about that week,

51
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,380
 how so often that's the journey of so many of us,

52
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,180
 that God tells us something, gives us a promise,

53
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,020
 gives us a hope,

54
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,900
 and we enter into it with a whole bunch of confidence.

55
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,140
 And yet sometimes things get worse before they get better.

56
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,340
 And I'm so grateful that Chris was willing to share

57
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,060
 just those profound reflections she had had

58
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,060
 about how God had met her in the worst

59
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,620
 and began to reform and reshape a character in her

60
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,700
 that would enable her to be the mother she needs to be

61
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,700
 to our adopted daughter, Mia.

62
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,220
 And you see in the chapter five,

63
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,500
 God beginning to take Moses

64
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,380
 and begin to shape in him a character,

65
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,980
 begin to shape and form out of the worst moments

66
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,660
 something that he would need to be

67
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,140
 in order to stand before all of the challenges

68
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,300
 that were gonna be ahead of him

69
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,540
 to be able to stand for God in those moments.

70
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,860
 He had to go through what it was

71
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,180
 that he was going through in chapter five.

72
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,700
 You know, one of the things I've known

73
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,220
 and experienced in my own pastoral career

74
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,420
 is that so often when God brings us through intense

75
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,180
 and difficult and hard times,

76
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,460
 so often he'll then bring us into a time of release

77
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,420
 and lightness and joy.

78
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,340
 See, God's a good God as we've just been singing

79
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,220
 and he's faithful to us.

80
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,580
 And the journey with God is not all mountaintop experiences

81
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,500
 but thankfully it's not all valley experiences either.

82
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,860
 And God moves us in valleys and peaks and valleys and peaks,

83
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,860
 times where things are hard

84
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,220
 and then a season afterwards of joy

85
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,300
 and a sense of closeness with God

86
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,900
 and things are going well again.

87
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,820
 And this is exactly what we see happen

88
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,620
 as we continue our study in the book of Exodus.

89
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,820
 'Cause chapter five, as hard as it is,

90
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,340
 as the deepest and darkest valley that it is,

91
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,500
 it moves into chapter six.

92
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,420
 And chapter six is like the opposite of chapter five.

93
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,900
 Where chapter five was intense and where are you God

94
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,220
 and why are things getting worse?

95
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,460
 Chapter six, God speaks again to Moses.

96
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,500
 And in chapter six,

97
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,180
 God begins to redefine his character to Moses once more

98
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,740
 and begins to tell Moses about who he is

99
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,500
 and what he's about to do and the victory

100
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,700
 and the good things and the character he has

101
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,140
 and the joy that is gonna be set before Moses.

102
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,460
 And you couldn't get more contrasting things side by side.

103
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,640
 When we were planning this series about four years ago,

104
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,900
 we were planning this chapter five week with you

105
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,580
 and we knew that Chris would be sharing her story

106
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,820
 and I knew that would be super intense.

107
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,060
 So I was like, okay, the next week,

108
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,980
 how do we capture the joy of chapter six?

109
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,380
 How do we capture the fact that it's so contrasting

110
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,980
 and so different and kind of fun

111
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,180
 and a lot lighter than chapter five?

112
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,180
 And one of the things that you guys have been asking me most

113
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,420
 over the last 10 weeks of doing this series,

114
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,260
 the number one question I've been getting from you

115
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,380
 is how did you actually film the thing?

116
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,820
 Like, how did you actually pull it off?

117
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,100
 Like, what was the journey

118
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
 of actually trying to put this whole Exodus series

119
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,340
 and all the films together?

120
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,180
 And so when we were planning this four years ago,

121
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,900
 we're like, wouldn't it be great to follow Chris's intensity

122
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,060
 with the joy of a behind the scenes kind of episode?

123
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,500
 Like take people behind the scenes

124
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,660
 and show them how crazy it was

125
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,620
 to actually put this whole thing together.

126
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,100
 Because the reality is if chapter five is hard

127
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,560
 and chapter six is good,

128
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,100
 there's a journey that you have to go through to get there.

129
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
 And if there's anything I can testify

130
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,140
 through this whole Exodus experience

131
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,780
 and the films and everything we made

132
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,420
 is that we went through that journey ourselves.

133
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,380
 That things got worse before they got better for us.

134
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,860
 That the whole journey was not easy.

135
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,460
 It wasn't fun all the time.

136
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
 It was challenging.

137
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,860
 And yet through that, we saw God do things

138
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,500
 that we never thought or expected He would ever do.

139
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,700
 And so today, I wanna make things a little bit more fun.

140
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,380
 And we're gonna actually go back to Egypt and Jordan,

141
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,260
 but I'm gonna take you behind the scenes.

142
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,620
 We're gonna do this by,

143
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,900
 but we actually put together a Zoom call

144
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,420
 with four of the key members of the crew.

145
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,940
 Toby Thomas, who was our director based in London.

146
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,580
 Anthony Gibbs, who's our editor based in Sydney.

147
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,220
 Riley Su, who's the producer of the whole series,

148
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,600
 who's based here in Hong Kong and myself.

149
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,180
 We all got on a call together

150
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,580
 to talk about the craziness of this journey.

151
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,140
 And so I wanna now take you behind the scenes with Exodus.

152
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,140
 Let's check it out.

153
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,720
 (upbeat music)

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:09,540
 - Hi, I'm Andrew.

155
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,700
 - Hey, I'm Toby.

156
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,700
 - Hi, I'm Riley.

157
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,660
 - I'm Anthony.

158
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,860
 - Yeah, so I think the project was originally conceived

159
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,380
 back in 2018.

160
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,420
 - I think I probably got like an Instagram message

161
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,460
 from Andrew.

162
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,780
 - Yeah, 2018 being like,

163
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,860
 "Hey man, love to speak to you about something."

164
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,540
 And then when he'd pitched the project to me,

165
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,340
 I was like, "Oh, this sounds like it's gonna be

166
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,580
 really, really exciting."

167
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,980
 - Toby, myself, and one of our producers

168
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,220
 in the very early days, Lauren,

169
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,940
 got on Skype back in those days

170
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,540
 and read through the book of Exodus

171
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,380
 over about three months together.

172
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,580
 That was sort of late 2018 into early 2019.

173
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,780
 And that was how we began everything.

174
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,740
 And I think soon after we finished reading that,

175
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,220
 we were expecting things to be boom, boom, boom,

176
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,940
 get the crew together, do some recces, start filming.

177
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,460
 And of course, you know, the world fell out from itself.

178
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,900
 - I mean, like just to give you an idea

179
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,020
 of how long this took, right?

180
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,900
 Like when this started, Toby was unmarried with no children

181
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,620
 and I didn't have a child.

182
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,340
 And now we're not even finished

183
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,940
 and Toby's married with two kids and I have one.

184
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,500
 I mean, that just goes to show how long this took.

185
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,220
 - I had brown hair when we started.

186
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,620
 So I guess the crew was firstly,

187
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,940
 the person who stayed on the project

188
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,140
 the whole time was Devin.

189
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,380
 Secondly, there was Oliver and then Anthony.

190
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,540
 Riley is strict on the budget.

191
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,980
 And we also had Ben with us.

192
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,420
 And then my role was the director.

193
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,940
 That was the crew on the ground.

194
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,580
 - We started off with Jordan first because of delays.

195
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,580
 - How was lunch?

196
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,620
 - Oh, fantastic.

197
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,580
 - So you'd expect from the first day of a game.

198
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,420
 - Thanks, friends.

199
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,340
 - And first location was the amazing Petra.

200
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,700
 We rocked up, you know, with our camera gear

201
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,620
 and there you have it.

202
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,540
 Oh, nope.

203
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,740
 - We're supposed to be shooting in the Petra.

204
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,020
 We wanted to get in super early whilst it was quiet

205
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,940
 and the light was good, but we have permits,

206
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,780
 but apparently now there's a new rule.

207
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,340
 We're being told that we need to wait maybe 30, 45 minutes

208
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,140
 for a security personnel to come

209
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,500
 and accompany us on the shoot,

210
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,060
 which we probably will have to pay for,

211
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,380
 which is kind of part of the thing.

212
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,540
 So a little frustrating right at the start.

213
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,940
 - How are you feeling, Toby?

214
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,500
 - A bit gassy.

215
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,620
 - And so that was our first day of shooting.

216
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,500
 We're all pumped up and it's like, oh, okay, slow down.

217
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,340
 Hang on, slow down.

218
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,940
 (upbeat music)

219
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,020
 (indistinct chatter)

220
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:49,300
 - We just done the first sort of four or five takes

221
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,380
 for episode 30.

222
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,540
 Yeah, I'm feeling good.

223
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,900
 From what I can tell on the little monitor,

224
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,460
 the shots look incredible.

225
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,340
 I feel like the content was strong.

226
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,100
 So it's all coming together.

227
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,980
 Crew have gone back to the hotel just to test everything,

228
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,220
 make sure we caught everything that we need.

229
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,900
 Now we're going to get a few more B-roll shots.

230
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,740
 Loving it.

231
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,500
 - There'll be a few moments on the trip

232
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,180
 where someone would turn up,

233
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,340
 there'd be five to seven minutes of shouting.

234
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,420
 I mean like guttural shouting,

235
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,500
 and then people would get in a car and drive away

236
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,100
 and then apparently it was fine.

237
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,220
 - We were at a location that we had gotten permit for

238
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,580
 and our fixers have told us that,

239
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,900
 yes, you can film there.

240
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,660
 And we rock up, we're in the middle of shooting

241
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,500
 and the owner of the location comes out

242
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,660
 and starts berating our fixers

243
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,060
 for allowing us to shoot there.

244
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,620
 - We went down to start filming.

245
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,740
 We got permits and everything, so everything's legit.

246
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,340
 But then we got a call from the local intelligence bureau,

247
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,860
 this area, saying that we had to stop shooting straight away.

248
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,100
 We came back to the car park

249
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,740
 and now there are Jordanian fixes

250
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,940
 and the security guys are having this massive argument

251
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,500
 and we're just praying that we'll be able to clear this up

252
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,740
 and get shooting again.

253
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,500
 But yeah, it's pretty disruptive

254
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,820
 to suddenly have this sort of stuff happen.

255
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,620
 - Definitely the most extreme shouting.

256
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,500
 Definitely the most intimidating people.

257
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,140
 - And so we got kicked out

258
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,220
 and we had to delete all of our footage from that location.

259
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,020
 - I distinctly remember at one point during the Jordan

260
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,940
 that I was like taking the SD cards out of my camera,

261
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,460
 putting like another empty one in

262
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,580
 and like putting the other one down my sock,

263
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,300
 just in case, you know.

264
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,620
 Just be like, "Oh no, I've got nothing.

265
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,780
 I haven't shot anything at all.

266
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,860
 What are you talking about?"

267
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,460
 (upbeat music)

268
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:48,420
 - Yeah, so Egypt is split by different kind of districts

269
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,860
 in some ways.

270
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,380
 And each of the areas have their own political sensitivities

271
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,700
 to them.

272
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,140
 And as you travel,

273
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,580
 and of course we were tracing the journey of Israel

274
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,660
 through Egypt.

275
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,340
 So we had to cross quite a few of these

276
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,260
 sort of internal borders, if you will.

277
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,020
 Every single time you would do that,

278
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,500
 you would have to go through a checkpoint.

279
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,980
 And the checkpoints are everywhere.

280
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,540
 - This is the fourth checkpoint of the day.

281
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,220
 And one of the guys that will wait

282
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,900
 for the Egyptian company raising this.

283
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,420
 I think they're all getting a bit frustrated.

284
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,380
 You know, it's really slow going where,

285
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,540
 you know, you constantly have to stop at these checkpoints.

286
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,740
 And sometimes they just kind of wait you through.

287
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,500
 Sometimes you have to stop for an hour

288
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,020
 and you just never know

289
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,060
 till you get there of what's gonna happen.

290
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,260
 And this one, I think they thought

291
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,300
 we were just gonna drive through

292
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,940
 and they've stopped us again.

293
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,700
 So yeah, tensions a bit high.

294
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,900
 - And I think, you know,

295
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,820
 so security in Sinai in particular,

296
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,860
 the Sinai Peninsula,

297
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,620
 that area, you know, can be quite,

298
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,460
 you know, again, politically sensitive.

299
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,940
 There were certain areas where we'd have a police escort

300
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,580
 to go to the various places that we needed to get to.

301
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,700
 There was this moment where we were driving down

302
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,980
 to Beni Hassan, which is in the South.

303
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,060
 We're in two vans with two police escorts

304
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,660
 with six people with guns in both vans,

305
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,980
 either side of us.

306
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,460
 And Devin is just like,

307
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,060
 "I am not gonna tell my wife

308
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,740
 this is happening right now, this moment.

309
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,980
 She can know when I get back."

310
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,340
 Because he's just like, "Why is this necessary?"

311
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,900
 So you're just kind of like watching over your shoulder,

312
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,580
 trying to figure out why all these people

313
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,100
 are escorting you there.

314
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,020
 It's because they think Andrew's a major celebrity, I think.

315
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,180
 - Yeah, I think that was the reason, yeah.

316
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,180
 I think the other important thing to kind of weigh in here

317
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,940
 with is I think actually doing a project like this

318
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,300
 in Egypt itself is incredibly complex and difficult.

319
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,860
 And it's funny, actually, Riley and I chatted about this

320
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,340
 early on in the project, and we did our research,

321
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,180
 like, "Who else?

322
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,220
 What other films are out there by churches on the Exodus?"

323
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,060
 And it was like, we could find nothing.

324
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,220
 I remember maybe like a year into the project,

325
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,500
 Riley was like, you know,

326
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,700
 Riley and I were having a conversation.

327
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,020
 It was basically like, now we know

328
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,580
 why no one else has done this thing.

329
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,620
 It's just incredibly complex.

330
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,420
 Oh my God.

331
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,420
 Yeah, so we went to the pyramids.

332
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,500
 We show up on day one.

333
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,380
 It was literally day one of the shoot.

334
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,620
 Day one, we went to the pyramids, excited.

335
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,900
 And we got all the cameras out.

336
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,420
 We're out there, and-

337
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,300
 - There's no one here.

338
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,860
 We've got the spot, let's go.

339
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,780
 - Okay, so we show up here back in 2019.

340
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,380
 They didn't have these flying lawnmowers

341
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,380
 around the pyramids, but now they're absolutely everywhere.

342
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,700
 And when you're trying to record sound,

343
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,460
 it's an absolute nightmare.

344
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,860
 So much of the last two days,

345
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,020
 it's been us standing ready to go,

346
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,620
 like, ready to shot action, and that happens.

347
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,940
 And the noise was just like,

348
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,620
 like, we can't do audio with these things

349
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,340
 flying over our heads.

350
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,100
 And it was just like, oh, the morale on day one

351
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,860
 was just like everyone looking at each other,

352
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,300
 feeling a bit awkward.

353
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,340
 - And any time, like, one would sort of fly away,

354
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,900
 we'd be like, "Okay, go, go, go, go."

355
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,500
 And I'd be like, "Do my thing."

356
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,140
 And it'd be like, this next one would fly in.

357
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,580
 We'd all have to stop all of a sudden.

358
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,300
 And so it was quite stressful, yeah.

359
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,300
 - The walk up to the top of St. Catherine's.

360
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,580
 I've never been able to be like,

361
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,620
 "I've seen something break someone,

362
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,260
 "but now I can say that."

363
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,900
 - That's Anthony and Andrew.

364
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,740
 So close.

365
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,580
 There they are.

366
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,580
 I'm falling behind.

367
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,340
 - Weather update, it is cold.

368
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,620
 Over there.

369
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,140
 - He's got his hands in it, he's so cold.

370
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
 He's got his hands in it.

371
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,060
 - And I think he healed over time.

372
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,820
 Probably when he returned back to Hong Kong,

373
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,780
 but he was a different man by the end of the walk up,

374
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,220
 let's put it that way.

375
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,340
 - In terms of like, yeah, I'm very proud of this project.

376
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,020
 It's been birthed through prayer and study and fellowship

377
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,620
 and just a deep relationship and trust for one another.

378
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,300
 - This is what we go through to get these shots.

379
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,300
 - Three hour drive.

380
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,140
 Till we sleep.

381
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:13,300
 And I have to put on a face mask.

382
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,260
 - Oh, this is sick.

383
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,900
 - For me, there were two highlights.

384
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,540
 I think one was on the top of Mount Sinai.

385
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,700
 We timed it a little bit wrong

386
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,940
 and we got up there two and a half hours

387
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,220
 before the sun came up.

388
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,100
 So we had a very cold two and a half hours

389
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,340
 on the top of this mountain in the pitch blackness.

390
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,580
 And we laid down and we looked up at the stars

391
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,060
 and the stars were just incredible.

392
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,700
 And we saw like, I don't know how many shooting stars.

393
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,700
 And I remember just having this prayer time,

394
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,980
 just myself praying with God on the top of Mount Sinai.

395
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,900
 Like it was just, that was very,

396
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,180
 I think that was the most spiritually moving moment for me.

397
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,020
 You know, when I thought about the whole project,

398
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,500
 the fact that we were finally there doing this dream

399
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,860
 that we'd had for so long

400
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,260
 and being on top of that mountain

401
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,740
 and feeling very connected to God.

402
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:07,060
 - I think for me, the hardest bit

403
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,340
 was when we had to cancel Egypt

404
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,260
 like two days before flying out.

405
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,180
 And I think internally I was kind of upset with God

406
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,500
 because I was just like, what is this?

407
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,820
 You know, if it's a no, we're not meant to go,

408
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,380
 then just tell us, then I wouldn't have to go through,

409
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,300
 you know, all the stress and like, you know,

410
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,940
 working like at three, 4 a.m. at night,

411
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,980
 trying to, you know, like cancel flights and tell everybody

412
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,340
 and then, you know, what next?

413
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,860
 And then like, oh, reconnecting them to Jordan instead.

414
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,580
 And that was, yeah, that was very hard.

415
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,900
 - It's interesting you share that, Raleigh,

416
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,860
 'cause that's exactly how the Israelites felt

417
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,500
 when they were there by the Red Sea,

418
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,100
 the armies coming at them.

419
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,180
 And they said to Moses, like, why did we even bother?

420
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,060
 Like, it would have been better

421
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,260
 if we'd just not even done this kind of thing.

422
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,780
 And I think it's really interesting that I think in a way,

423
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,780
 we did experience that same sort of feeling

424
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,980
 throughout the trip.

425
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,860
 You know, why are we doing this?

426
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,980
 Like, why has God set us up to fail?

427
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,900
 It felt like that a few times, you know?

428
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,940
 And yeah, it's interesting how that,

429
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,220
 I think that connects into the actual Exodus story itself.

430
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,540
 - You like that how Moses would have felt like,

431
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,420
 oh gosh, like, God, you better,

432
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,860
 you better like show up and pull through.

433
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,580
 I've got like 2 million people here

434
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,060
 who's gonna like slaughter me if this doesn't work out.

435
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,380
 - Yeah, and that's exactly how I felt on the flight over.

436
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,900
 I'm like, not that I've got 2 million people,

437
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,500
 I've got like a crew of eight or whatever,

438
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,060
 but you know, like I'm flying over going like,

439
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,380
 God, you better, this better work.

440
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,260
 So we're taking a step of faith here

441
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,620
 and that's very much what Exodus is all about.

442
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,980
 - Yeah, that,

443
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,540
 (audience applauding)

444
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,420
 so that idea of a step of faith

445
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,020
 is what the Exodus is all about

446
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,220
 and it's exactly what we see

447
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,980
 between chapter five and chapter six.

448
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,740
 And so much of our journey through the filming of this,

449
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,580
 is it gonna happen?

450
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,420
 Is it gonna work?

451
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,260
 Is God gonna come through?

452
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,820
 Is exactly how Moses is feeling

453
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,900
 as he steps into this new chapter.

454
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,980
 And finally God begins to speak.

455
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,300
 And it's amazing what God does

456
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,660
 in the beginning of chapter six.

457
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,500
 He gives Moses three reasons why Moses should trust him.

458
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,260
 And no matter where you are right now

459
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,700
 in your relationship with God,

460
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,660
 no matter what low you might be facing at the moment,

461
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,260
 these are three things that you can take to the bank.

462
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:29,260
 Three things that you always have a reason to trust God.

463
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,420
 I wanna share these with you.

464
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,060
 Starting in chapter six, verse one.

465
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,060
 Then the Lord said to Moses,

466
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,900
 "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh.

467
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,540
 "Because of my mighty hand, he will let him go.

468
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,980
 "Because of my mighty hand,

469
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,420
 "he will drive them out of this country or of his country."

470
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,740
 The first thing Lord does to try to remind Moses

471
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,780
 about how he can trust him

472
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,540
 is he speaks about his mighty hand.

473
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,180
 Now this phrase, a mighty hand,

474
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,500
 becomes a common phrase

475
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,140
 throughout the rest of the Old Testament narrative

476
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,780
 from this point from here.

477
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,140
 But its roots are in the Exodus story.

478
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,980
 It's mentioned twice in this passage alone,

479
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,260
 but it's mentioned multiple times

480
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,100
 throughout the rest of the book of Exodus.

481
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
 And when it's mentioned, it's talking about two things.

482
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,140
 It's talking about the power that God has

483
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,060
 to fight battles that we are not able to fight.

484
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,580
 That's the first thing that's meant.

485
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,220
 When God says, "My hand is mighty,

486
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,180
 "my hand is working in a mighty way."

487
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,140
 He's saying, "I'm fighting battles on your behalf

488
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,540
 "that you cannot fight."

489
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,920
 The second thing it means is that,

490
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,280
 "I am at work influencing human affairs

491
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,920
 "in a way that you could not influence or do yourself."

492
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,320
 So these are sovereign responses of God.

493
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,500
 His mighty hand fights battles we cannot fight

494
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,360
 and changes human hearts and changes human affairs

495
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,620
 in ways that we could never do.

496
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,020
 And God is wanting to speak to Moses and saying,

497
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,820
 "Right now, it seems like it's getting worse

498
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,680
 "before it gets better.

499
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,700
 "Right now, it seems like things are really hard,

500
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,980
 "but you gotta remember, my mighty hand is on your behalf."

501
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,820
 He doesn't say to Moses, "Trust in your mighty hand."

502
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,400
 He doesn't say, "Trust in your power,

503
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,460
 "trust in your ability to influence Pharaoh,

504
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,760
 "trust in your speaking ability,

505
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,740
 "trust in all these things."

506
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,760
 He doesn't say that, he says, "Trust in me.

507
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,600
 "Trust in who you know I am.

508
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,780
 "I'm a mighty God with a mighty hand.

509
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,740
 "I'm fighting battles and I can influence world affairs

510
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,100
 "like you never could."

511
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,140
 And some of you here, that's the call for you,

512
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,460
 to trust in a God who is able to do what you cannot do

513
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,420
 and stop fighting in your own strength

514
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,020
 because that only ever leaves the burnout

515
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,740
 and actually open your heart to the fact

516
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,140
 that God is fighting on your behalf.

517
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,040
 He's got a mighty hand.

518
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,240
 And I love what God says right at the beginning

519
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,000
 of this verse, he says, "Now you will see my mighty hand."

520
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,680
 In other words, he's not asking Moses

521
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,960
 to believe in blind faith.

522
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,760
 He's not just saying, "Believe in my mighty power,

523
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,680
 "even though you're never gonna see it."

524
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,100
 He's like, "Now you will see my might and my power at work.

525
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,960
 "I'm about to change Pharaoh's heart.

526
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,200
 "His heart is hardened, but I'm gonna soften it.

527
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,040
 "I'm gonna cause him to let you go.

528
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,640
 "You're gonna see the power of my hand at work.

529
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,800
 "I'm gonna fight battles for you

530
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,840
 "throughout the whole journey.

531
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,000
 "It's about to take place.

532
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,620
 "Now you will see."

533
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,900
 And I think this is really important

534
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,240
 because so often if we're in a low time,

535
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,640
 if we're in a valley,

536
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,240
 if it seems like things are getting worse

537
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,180
 before they get better, it's so easy for us,

538
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,520
 so quick for us to forget the powerful things

539
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
 God has done in the past.

540
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,080
 And I believe for some of you in this room,

541
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,400
 that's exactly what God wants to be doing.

542
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,480
 He wants you to have that faith again to say,

543
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,860
 "Now I'm going to see the power of God."

544
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,380
 Something changes in us in terms of our faith

545
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,880
 when we see the power of God at work.

546
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
 I remember a few years ago,

547
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,980
 I was on a KMB bus in Kowloon

548
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,760
 and I'm traveling through Kowloon somewhere

549
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,080
 and I'm on this bus and this is kind of like

550
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,720
 a pastor's thing, but every once in a while

551
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
 when you're a pastor and you get into a place

552
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,800
 where nobody knows you,

553
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,500
 you kind of just breathe a sigh of relief.

554
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,960
 It's like, I don't need to be a pastor now

555
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,240
 for like the next five minutes

556
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,720
 and I can enjoy my bus ride in Kowloon

557
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,640
 where no one knows me.

558
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,160
 It's awesome.

559
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,000
 So I'm on this bus, I'm relaxed, I'm chilled.

560
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,100
 I kid you not, after about five minutes of going,

561
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,440
 this guy about four seats away from me

562
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,820
 starts to manifest demonically.

563
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,820
 Now I've been involved and I've been around demonic work

564
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,720
 and I've been involved in deliverance of people

565
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,760
 that have demonic spirits over my pastoral years

566
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,340
 and so I knew exactly what was happening.

567
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,920
 I knew that this was what was taking place in this person

568
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,760
 and it was so funny 'cause my immediate reaction was,

569
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,160
 "Is there any other Christian on this bus

570
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,220
 "who can step up right now

571
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,520
 "'cause I'm on a short holiday right now?"

572
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,620
 You know what I mean?

573
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,900
 And I heard God say something to me straight away.

574
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,720
 He said, "Andrew, do you wanna see my power?"

575
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,000
 It's a great question.

576
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,020
 'Cause you'd think immediately we'd say yes, right?

577
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,620
 But do you really wanna see my power?

578
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,040
 And I said, "Yeah, God, I wanna see your power."

579
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,200
 He's like, "Well, pray for him then.

580
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,380
 "Deliver a demon and you'll see my power."

581
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,640
 And so mustering up all of the faith that I have,

582
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,480
 which wasn't very much at that time,

583
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,400
 I said out loud, I said, "In Jesus' name, be gone."

584
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,500
 And immediately he fell asleep.

585
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,400
 Just fell asleep.

586
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,680
 Just totally like passed out, fell asleep.

587
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,140
 And I was like, "Whoa, that was cool."

588
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,920
 I just saw the power of God.

589
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,080
 I'm like, "Is that gonna work again

590
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,560
 "next time I'm arguing with my wife?

591
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,000
 "In the name of Jesus!"

592
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,320
 (congregation laughing)

593
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,580
 (laughing)

594
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,220
 David's like, "Teach me, teach me."

595
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,460
 (congregation laughing)

596
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,980
 God says to Moses, "Now you will see."

597
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,860
 And I think sometimes there's a faith needed

598
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,940
 in the church around the world to say, "God, I wanna see."

599
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,020
 Would you move in power like you've never moved before?

600
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,980
 We need it now, Lord.

601
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,740
 Would you come and would you show yourself faithful?

602
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,020
 So God says, "You can trust me

603
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,980
 "'cause I'm a mighty hand, I'm at work."

604
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,980
 Here's the second thing he says in verse two.

605
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,260
 God also said to Moses, "I am the Lord."

606
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,500
 This is the word Yahweh.

607
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,080
 "I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty,

608
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,080
 "but by my name, the Lord,

609
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,420
 "I did not make myself known to them."

610
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,320
 So it's an amazing thing what he says here,

611
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,500
 even though I can't read it.

612
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,340
 What he's saying here is there's two names

613
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,300
 that you have to understand that I've revealed myself.

614
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,240
 There's a name that I revealed myself

615
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,260
 to the generations in the past,

616
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,740
 and he says that's the name Lord Almighty.

617
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,060
 And there's a name now that I'm generating

618
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,860
 and that I'm giving to you, which is Yahweh.

619
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,860
 Now, here's what you need to understand.

620
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,580
 The name that he had given to the generations of the past,

621
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,820
 to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was El Shaddai.

622
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,180
 It means the God of might or the God of power.

623
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,040
 So when he first reveals and he calls Abraham

624
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,380
 to come out and to start the new nation of Israel,

625
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,020
 he reveals himself as El Shaddai,

626
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,660
 the God of power, the God of might.

627
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,900
 But when he shows up and reveals himself to Moses

628
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,940
 at the beginning of the Exodus at the burning bush,

629
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,820
 he doesn't use that name, he uses a new name.

630
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,940
 The name is Yahweh, which is translated

631
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,820
 in the Old Testament Lord in capital letters,

632
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,660
 but it essentially means I am who I am,

633
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,460
 or he is who he is, or he will be what he will be.

634
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,500
 Or more specifically, it means he will be with us.

635
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,860
 So I want you to see something powerful that God does.

636
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,900
 And this is the second reason why he says to Moses

637
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,820
 that he can trust him.

638
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,480
 He says, it's because you need to understand

639
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,060
 that I'm revealing something about myself

640
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,480
 that I had not revealed in history past.

641
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,000
 With your generations in the past,

642
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,820
 I reveal myself mighty and powerful,

643
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,740
 but for you, I'm revealing myself personally,

644
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,540
 intimately, the one who is with you.

645
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,900
 In fact, this is what we've seen of God

646
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,980
 throughout the whole of the Exodus journey so far.

647
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,420
 I have seen the misery of my people

648
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,340
 and I've come down to be with them.

649
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,360
 I have compassion because I see their pain

650
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,380
 and their suffering, I wanna be here with them.

651
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,060
 And so it's fascinating to me that God reveals himself

652
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,460
 differently at different seasons and different times.

653
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,420
 And note this, 'cause I think God got it

654
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,740
 around the wrong way.

655
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,860
 When you see the El Shaddai at the beginning,

656
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,580
 God of power, and the Yahweh, the personal,

657
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,900
 shouldn't it have been the other way around?

658
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,140
 Like when God first reveals himself to Abraham,

659
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,100
 you would think he would reveal himself personally

660
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,380
 and intimately with him.

661
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,140
 Hey, it's us, it's me, I'm your God.

662
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,020
 Let me tell you a little bit about what it is to worship me.

663
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,420
 Let's journey together.

664
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,500
 You know, that's the establishing of relationship.

665
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,660
 You think God would reveal himself personally.

666
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,300
 And when it comes to the Exodus,

667
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,260
 wouldn't you think that God would reveal himself mighty

668
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,180
 and powerful and like awesome and stuff?

669
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,780
 But he doesn't, he does it the other way around.

670
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,820
 With Abraham and Isaac, it's power and might.

671
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,340
 With Moses and Israel, in the moment of their greatest need,

672
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,260
 it's intimacy, care, and love.

673
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,660
 And the question you should be asking yourself is why?

674
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:48,060
 The answer is this, the greatest amount of God's power

675
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,940
 that you will ever experience in your life

676
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,380
 will come through his intimacy and his care for you.

677
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,500
 God breaks chains over you

678
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,460
 by deepening his relationship with you.

679
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:05,260
 So his personal and intimate relationship with us,

680
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,820
 his desire to draw close

681
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,860
 so that we can know him personally and intimately,

682
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,820
 that is always going to be the place

683
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,740
 where you will find your greatest freedom.

684
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,620
 You will find your greatest breakthroughs,

685
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,860
 your greatest freedoms,

686
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,940
 your greatest walking out of slavery

687
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,820
 when you know the intimacy of a God,

688
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,500
 when you have that intimate, personal,

689
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,300
 connected relationship with him.

690
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,820
 If you only have the God of power,

691
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,500
 you might break some chains,

692
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,180
 but you will fall back into those chains again.

693
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,100
 The thing that sustains you,

694
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,060
 the thing that's gonna enable you

695
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,460
 to walk out of those chains forever and move into freedom

696
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,060
 will be because you know there's a God

697
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,220
 who walks with you intimately and purposely

698
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,060
 every step of the way.

699
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,020
 His care, his love, his intimacy with you

700
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,500
 is the defining thing that won't just break the chains,

701
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,260
 but will keep them off you.

702
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,460
 Are you with me?

703
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,860
 So you can trust me, God says to Moses,

704
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,940
 because I am this mighty and powerful God

705
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,020
 and I'm in fighting battles

706
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,100
 and I'm involved in the hearts of man,

707
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,900
 but you can also trust me because I'm with you.

708
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,780
 I know you and I love you and I'm caring for you.

709
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,300
 And both of those two things are a reality at the same time

710
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,780
 and your freedom needs both of those things.

711
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,820
 Here's the third thing he does in verse four.

712
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,940
 He says, "I also established my covenant with them

713
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,460
 to give them the land of Canaan

714
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,060
 where they had lived as aliens.

715
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,500
 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites

716
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,100
 whom the Egyptians are enslaving

717
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,660
 and I have remembered my covenant."

718
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,340
 The third reason that he gives

719
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,180
 for the reason why Moses can now trust him

720
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,620
 is 'cause of the covenant.

721
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,220
 And God has mentioned his covenant

722
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,780
 every step of the way of the Exodus so far to Moses

723
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,220
 'cause it's that important to God.

724
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,260
 His covenant is his contract with his people

725
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,660
 that he will deliver them,

726
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,140
 that he will bring the promises

727
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,580
 that he has in his heart for him.

728
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,140
 His covenant is the established reality

729
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,620
 that I have taken you, I have chosen you,

730
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,780
 you are my people.

731
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,420
 And because I have said my word, I never break my word.

732
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,100
 You can trust me because I'm covenanted to you.

733
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,260
 I'm connected with you.

734
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,620
 I have a contract with you.

735
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,620
 I've chosen you.

736
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,540
 I've done that in my own free will,

737
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,940
 not because you've earned it, not because you deserve it,

738
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,500
 but because I desire to be in relationship with you.

739
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,780
 And because I have covenanted,

740
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,900
 I've contractually committed myself to you.

741
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,500
 No matter what you do,

742
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,020
 it will not break the power of the coming of the promise

743
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
 that I have for you.

744
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,900
 You can trust me, God says, because I stand on my word.

745
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,340
 You can trust me 'cause I never forget my contracts.

746
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,980
 You can trust me because unlike so many of us,

747
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,780
 you can take my word to the bank.

748
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,180
 If I've said it, if I've declared it,

749
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,900
 it will come to pass, says the Lord Almighty.

750
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,220
 So these three things

751
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,860
 is what God is trying to communicate to Moses.

752
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,340
 You can trust me because I am mighty before you.

753
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,740
 I am personal with you and I'm covenanted to you.

754
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,740
 And those three things are what you can build your life on.

755
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,940
 You can trust God,

756
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,420
 no matter what circumstance situation

757
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,580
 is going on in your life,

758
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,580
 because he is mighty and powerful to save,

759
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,900
 because he is personal and intimate with his people,

760
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,540
 because he has placed a covenant over us.

761
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,420
 In the Old Testament, in Exodus,

762
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,940
 a covenant written on stone.

763
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,620
 In the New Testament through Jesus,

764
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,140
 a covenant given by the blood of Christ.

765
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,060
 Those things have never changed.

766
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,780
 These three things, which are started and founded here

767
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,220
 at the beginning of chapter six,

768
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,380
 become the complete foundation

769
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,740
 of our relationship with God.

770
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,380
 It is the foundation of our Christian faith

771
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,620
 that he is mighty, personal, and committed.

772
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,180
 Are you with me still?

773
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,700
 Now, off the back of all three of those,

774
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,300
 I want you to see what then God says.

775
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,900
 He said, "Because you can trust me for these three things,

776
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,460
 here are seven things I'm gonna do for you."

777
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,620
 And I think these seven things he does

778
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,860
 for Moses in Israel are seven things

779
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,980
 he will always do for you.

780
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,420
 Let me show you this really quick.

781
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,500
 Verse six, "Therefore say to the Israelites,

782
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,380
 I am the Lord," there it is, Yahweh, this personal God,

783
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,580
 "I will bring you up out from under the yoke

784
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,420
 of the Egyptians.

785
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,420
 I will free you from being slaves to them.

786
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,420
 I will redeem you with an outstretched arm

787
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,820
 and with mighty acts of judgment.

788
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,700
 I will take you as my own people.

789
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,180
 I will be your God.

790
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,340
 Then you will know that I am the Lord God

791
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,820
 who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.

792
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,580
 I will bring you to the land that I swore

793
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,980
 with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

794
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,380
 I will give it to you as a possession,

795
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,580
 for I am the Lord."

796
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,900
 Seven I will do statements here.

797
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,460
 Let me show you the seven here.

798
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,740
 I will bring you out, I will free you,

799
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,740
 I will redeem you, I will take you,

800
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,740
 I will be your God, I will bring you, I will give it to you.

801
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,180
 These are the seven things that he says,

802
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,580
 "Because I have a foundation of my mighty power,

803
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,620
 my personal intimacy, and my covenant with you,

804
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,260
 I will do these seven things for you, Moses."

805
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,100
 And I say, he's doing these seven things

806
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,180
 for the vine church, for you,

807
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,700
 and whatever journey of Exodus you're in,

808
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,140
 he will do these things for you.

809
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,220
 Now, what's beautiful is when you read this in the Hebrew,

810
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,140
 rather than the English, when you read it in English,

811
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,140
 it just looks like a random bit of a list.

812
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,300
 When you read it in the Hebrew,

813
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,660
 you can see that poetically the writer here

814
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,780
 is trying to group these under four different phases

815
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,820
 of who God is.

816
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,180
 And I wanna show you this really quick.

817
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,220
 The first is this idea of take.

818
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,260
 God declares to Moses, "I will take you.

819
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,140
 I will take you and be your God, because that's who I am.

820
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,540
 I've chosen you of my own free will.

821
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,580
 And because I will take you, here's what I will do for you.

822
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,860
 The second thing, I will bless you.

823
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,100
 If I take you to be mine, then my promises, my character,

824
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,820
 my love will be yours.

825
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,860
 In taking you to be part of my family, in being your God,

826
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,420
 I will then give to you these promises."

827
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,260
 And it's capturing this idea of I will bring you in,

828
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,500
 as he says in this passage.

829
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,300
 In other words, there is a time in the future

830
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,300
 where you will be in my promises.

831
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,900
 The things that I have for you

832
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,420
 will always be a blessing for you.

833
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,860
 I bless the things that I have chosen and taken.

834
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,700
 Are you with me?

835
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,260
 So I will take you so that I would ultimately bless you.

836
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,220
 Now, however, I cannot bless you until I, third,

837
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,060
 break some of the things that are holding you enslaved.

838
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,220
 So this idea of breaking,

839
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,700
 or I will bring you out of your slavery,

840
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,260
 I will free you from the bonds of your slavery,

841
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,460
 I will redeem you or save you.

842
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,720
 These are the ideas of God breaking the bonds

843
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,640
 that are holding Israel out of the promises

844
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,420
 that God had already declared for them.

845
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,180
 So I'm gonna take you because I have a promise

846
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,620
 that I wanna bless you with,

847
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,700
 but to get you there,

848
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,420
 I gotta break some of that stuff off of you.

849
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,500
 Once it's broken, then I can give you,

850
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,780
 that's the final phase,

851
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,780
 I can give you what it is that I long to give you.

852
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,420
 And so this idea of I will actually give you,

853
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,260
 as it said here.

854
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,040
 So those seven things actually become a part

855
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,940
 of a four-stage process

856
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,940
 that God is declaring to Israel in this moment

857
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,980
 and saying, "The rest of the Exodus is about this.

858
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,060
 I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna pull my blessings on you,

859
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,180
 I'm gonna break off Pharaoh's hold from you,

860
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,460
 and then eventually I will give you the promised land

861
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,300
 that you'll move in."

862
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,720
 Are you with me still?

863
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,700
 This idea of taking, blessing, breaking, and giving

864
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,020
 becomes the foundational thinking for Jewish people

865
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,780
 when it comes to their understanding of God.

866
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,500
 And it's based here in Exodus chapter six,

867
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,860
 the mountain after the valley of Exodus chapter five.

868
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,400
 But it's not the only time in history

869
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,440
 when this concept becomes so important for God's people.

870
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,340
 In fact, as I draw to a close,

871
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,040
 I wanna share with you one final passage

872
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,000
 that happens in the New Testament.

873
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,040
 This is a moment where Jesus,

874
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,000
 just literally the night before He's about to be betrayed,

875
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,840
 He comes before His disciples

876
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,840
 and they find an upper room to celebrate Passover.

877
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,520
 Passover, the meal that was celebrated

878
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,840
 and is still celebrated today

879
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,840
 by Jewish people around the world,

880
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,000
 that recognizes the power of God

881
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,020
 to bring people out of their slavery.

882
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,140
 And so in this moment,

883
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,380
 Jesus is celebrating a Jewish festival with His disciples

884
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,640
 that's linked to the Exodus.

885
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,480
 Does that make sense to you?

886
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,800
 Are you with me?

887
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,640
 Everybody still okay?

888
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,160
 Okay, you need to follow this.

889
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,400
 So He's sitting in this upper room

890
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,160
 and He's doing a Jewish festival with His disciples.

891
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,680
 But for the first time in history,

892
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,160
 Jesus will now embody Himself into the Exodus narrative.

893
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,600
 He will now say that that whole journey

894
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,800
 that took place in Exodus was actually about me

895
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,760
 and the journey I'm about to bring you on.

896
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,000
 I wanna show you this in what He says, verse 14 onwards.

897
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,200
 This is Luke 22, verse 14.

898
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,180
 When the hour had come,

899
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,500
 Jesus and His apostles reclined at the table.

900
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,340
 And He said to them,

901
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,720
 "I've eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you

902
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,000
 before I suffer.

903
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,720
 For I tell you that I will not eat of it again

904
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,200
 until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.

905
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,080
 After taking the cup,

906
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,920
 He gave thanks and said,

907
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,800
 "Take this and divide it among you.

908
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,360
 For I tell you that I will not drink again

909
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,240
 of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."

910
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,680
 Verse 19, He took the bread, gave thanks and broke it

911
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,120
 and gave it to them and said this,

912
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,680
 "This is my body given for you.

913
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,040
 Do this in remembrance of me."

914
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,400
 In the same way, after the supper,

915
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,220
 He took the cup saying,

916
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,040
 "This cup is the new covenant in my blood,

917
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,880
 which is poured out for you."

918
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,580
 I want you to hear Exodus in this.

919
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,560
 It's the Passover celebration.

920
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,620
 And Jesus is talking about a new covenant

921
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,600
 He's going to bring, linking to Exodus chapter six.

922
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,120
 But I want you to see where the link is most powerful.

923
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,440
 Take a look at verse 19.

924
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,760
 "And He took bread, He blessed it,

925
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,600
 He broke it and He gave it to them."

926
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,280
 Isn't that crazy?

927
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,240
 Jesus, in deciding to create

928
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,600
 what we now commonly call communion,

929
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,360
 what the church has been practicing for over 2000 years,

930
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,680
 Jesus begins that practice by literally doing

931
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,040
 the very four things that is rooted

932
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,440
 in chapter six of Exodus.

933
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,080
 He takes the bread, He blesses it,

934
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,840
 He breaks it and He gives it,

935
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,020
 creating a tradition that we now do

936
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,120
 that not only aligns ourselves to Jesus,

937
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,000
 but aligns herself to the God of the Exodus,

938
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,980
 the one who is mighty, personal and covenanted to us.

939
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,360
 And this is exactly what happens for Jesus Himself.

940
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,320
 God has taken Christ Jesus.

941
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,160
 He has blessed Him with His life on earth.

942
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,760
 His body is broken on the cross

943
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,100
 so that that body broken and the blood shed

944
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,900
 would give those who would believe in Him eternal life.

945
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:35,040
 In the same way, Christ, through His relationship with you,

946
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,980
 He has taken you from your bondage of slavery.

947
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,320
 He has blessed you with His presence and with the gospel.

948
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,240
 He has broken off the slavery of sin in your life

949
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,080
 and He has given you eternal life.

950
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,960
 Take, bless, give.

951
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
 I got it wrong.

952
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,640
 Take, bless, break, give

953
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,120
 is the process that God has for His people.

954
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,680
 That's the God of the Exodus, my friends.

955
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,240
 Whatever it is that you're going through right now,

956
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,680
 those four things God does for you

957
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,160
 and you can trust Him 'cause He has the might to do it,

958
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,960
 He's personally with you, He's covenanted to you

959
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,680
 and He will take you, He will bless you,

960
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,980
 He will break off the things that need to be broken off

961
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,800
 so that He can give you all the promises

962
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,820
 that He's longed to give you, amen?
