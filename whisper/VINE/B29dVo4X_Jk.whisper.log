[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160]   >> Amen. >> Amen.
[00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.000]   >> Thank you, Jess.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   I think once a year I kick a football around,
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.440]   so considering that, it was a really good day, actually.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.200]   No injuries, it was really fun.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.040]   Well, a lot of times people ask you,
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.680]   how did you first become a pastor?
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.000]   When did you start your journey?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.600]   And so let me tell you a little bit about that.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.840]   I started my journey into full-time ministry
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.360]   as a youth pastor.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.640]   And back then I was serving the church I grew up in
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.720]   over in Kowloon Tong.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.440]   I see Paco right there, actually.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.680]   He was in my youth group.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.800]   Oh, okay, well I'm talking about you, okay, Paco?
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.920]   Anyway, so I was the youth pastor for a little while,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.000]   and youth work is a great way to get to know
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.520]   how to do ministry.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.520]   And one of the things I got to do was to take youth groups
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.920]   on mission trips.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.560]   And so this was about 17 years ago.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.660]   I was just a kid back then, so I was like a big kid
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.560]   taking some little kids to a foreign country,
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.200]   a place I didn't know the language,
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.560]   I didn't know the people, to serve a group.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.840]   I didn't even really know who I was connecting with.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080]   It's amazing that the parents allowed this all to happen
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.120]   in the first place, right?
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.200]   But it was a really good trip, actually, overall.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.000]   But on the first night when we got there,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.360]   we were looking for a place to have dinner.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.840]   Okay, actually, we were on Hainan Island.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.120]   This is when I discovered that Hainanese chicken rice
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.520]   is not really from Hainan Island, okay?
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.920]   Amongst many other things.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.560]   So we were looking for a place to have dinner.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.520]   I was walking around with me and a bunch of about 12
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.960]   other kids, teenagers, preteens, and so we found this place.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.600]   It was a cheap hot pot place, so I thought, perfect.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.600]   Hong Kong kids, cheap hot pot, perfect place for dinner.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.800]   And so we decided to have dinner there.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.440]   And when we walked in, we discovered, actually,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.080]   it's a all-you-can-eat place.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.200]   So yeah, we loved that.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.080]   But how it worked was you get one visit to the buffet table,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.400]   you get as much food as you want,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.120]   and you can bring it back to the table,
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.360]   and that was your dinner.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.700]   Okay, so we were all there having a good time
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.680]   and eating away, and there was one kid, though,
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.480]   who got way too much food.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.800]   Like, it was just like a ridiculous amount of food.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.720]   Now, do you remember back in the day,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.740]   or back when I was growing up, Pizza Hut, right,
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.900]   had the salad bar, right?
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.240]   Oh, Pizza Hut salad bar, right?
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.560]   Me going out for Pizza Hut was like, yes, you know,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.280]   Saitan, you know, white people food, right?
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.440]   This is amazing, okay?
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.360]   But that salad bar, right, you got that really flimsy,
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.360]   brown, like, bamboo-ish sort of bowl, do you remember that?
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.880]   Right, and there was whole art to, like,
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.480]   building up the salad, right?
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.400]   So you put, like, the potatoes at the bottom
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.960]   to get, like, a foundation, right?
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.560]   Stick some cucumbers on the side
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.520]   so you could, like, widen the bowl a little bit, right?
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.720]   And people would come back,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.780]   and it was, like, this huge tower of salad, right?
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.720]   But in the end, like, it just got wasted
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.640]   'cause it was disgusting.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.360]   It was like Thousand Island sauce over, like,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.520]   pineapples and raisins and, like,
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.800]   all this random stuff mashed together.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.000]   It was disgusting.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.360]   No one actually liked the salad,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.200]   and I think they just liked seeing how tall
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.600]   they could make that tower, right,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.360]   and bringing it back to the table.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.740]   Well, that's kind of what happened, right?
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.540]   This kid got all this food, right?
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.680]   There was so much, so much food that he got.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.640]   He couldn't finish it all.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.800]   All right, so I got really upset.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.600]   I was like, what are we gonna do, right?
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.880]   You've wasted all this food.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.120]   But then I also thought to myself,
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.040]   okay, there's a teachable moment here, all right?
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.000]   How am I gonna make this into a life lesson, right?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.840]   So it's a true story.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.680]   This is what I did, right?
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680]   I told the young guy, he's like,
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.200]   dude, like, what happened?
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.440]   You just wasted all this food.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.480]   And he said to me, yeah, I thought
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.920]   it was all you can eat, Ellison.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.280]   So, well, yeah, all you can eat
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   doesn't mean all you can waste, okay?
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.600]   So, like, what are we gonna do about this?
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.800]   You know, you didn't eat the food.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.840]   You're gonna have to pay for it now.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.080]   And he starts to panic.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.840]   He's like, well, I didn't do anything wrong, right?
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.880]   You said it was all you can eat.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.120]   I'm just gonna put the food back.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.840]   He's like, dude, that's disgusting, okay?
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.740]   Do not put the food back, okay?
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.960]   It's at the table now.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.960]   All right, something's gotta happen.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.260]   And he said, what's gonna happen?
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.840]   So, I told him, okay, well, the manager's gonna come.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.720]   He's gonna weigh all the food.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.140]   And according to how much it weighs,
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.840]   you're gonna have to pay the penalty
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.160]   for wasting all this food.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.640]   And then he really starts to panic.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.560]   So, well, how much money are you gonna have to pay?
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   Like, my mom didn't give me that much pocket money.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.400]   You know, I've been planning to spend on some souvenirs.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   Like, I don't have it.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.440]   Like, what am I gonna do?
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.620]   So, I told him, okay, the only way you can get out of this
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.360]   is if you go to the manager
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.880]   and you beg him for forgiveness, okay?
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.240]   Beg him for forgiveness.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.560]   Maybe he'll just let you go.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.560]   He's panicking.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.400]   Where is he?
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.760]   So, I point to a gentleman
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.040]   sitting on the other side of the restaurant.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.920]   Okay, that's the manager sitting right there, right?
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.640]   Now, I've just pointed to a random guy
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.040]   minding his business, okay?
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.260]   He's there having dinner with his family, right?
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.960]   Because the truth was, there was no manager, okay?
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.240]   Who was mad at him.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.140]   I just, like I said, teachable moment.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.340]   I wanted to teach him a lesson to not to waste food.
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.980]   Right, so this boy, he stands there for a minute, right?
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.180]   And he's like sweating bullets.
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.500]   He's like rehearsing what he's gonna say,
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.340]   practicing his Mandarin.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.300]   He's like, (mimics Mandarin)
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.900]   Right, and so, and then he really like,
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.660]   coyly walks up to this man, taps him on the shoulder,
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.900]   and he just starts going for it.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.740]   I'm really sorry.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.180]   I've ate all this food.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.140]   I don't have money to pay.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.420]   Please forgive me, right?
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.820]   And this man's just staring blankly at him like,
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.500]   why is this kid like confessing all his sins to me
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.840]   right now, you know?
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.820]   And then, anyway, I was standing in the corner
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.020]   also crying, but with laughter, right?
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.940]   Like, I'm not saying it was a good thing or a bad thing.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.820]   I don't know, but no more food was wasted that trip.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.900]   We'll say it like that, okay?
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.900]   So, now of course, you know, that's a bit of a funny story.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.500]   But in a way, we sort of, we've all been there, right?
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.300]   In that moment.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.740]   Like that moment when we realize we've done something wrong
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.820]   and the guilt and the shame and the fear
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.460]   that comes with that.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.120]   And then you have this reaction of trying
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.020]   to make things right, realizing then,
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.580]   actually, there is nothing I can do to make it right.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.540]   The only thing left for me to do is to ask for forgiveness
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.840]   and hope that forgiveness is offered to us.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.020]   You know, we're at the tail end of the year already,
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.340]   believe it or not.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.180]   And we have Advent starting soon.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.120]   But before Advent, this is our last sermon series
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.380]   of the year.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.380]   And actually, this sermon series was born out of a heart cry
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.340]   of the community, I believe.
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.420]   You may remember a few months ago,
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.860]   we did an event called Converse.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.860]   And at Converse, we set up prayer stations
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.900]   up at a high school, you know, just up the hill.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.840]   And there was a big hall and there was all these different,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.340]   amazing prayer stations, different ways for us
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.980]   to interact with prayer.
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.020]   And one of the stations was to do with forgiveness, right?
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.540]   It was either asking, you know, prayer requests
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.380]   to give forgiveness or to receive forgiveness.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.540]   And as we looked through the prayer requests
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.100]   that were written out, we realized, right,
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.100]   this is a theme that so many of us are struggling with
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.420]   in our community.
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.300]   Many of these had to do with relationships, right?
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.060]   People asking for the strength to be able to forgive people
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.700]   that have hurt them in different ways.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.360]   There were also many voices asking for forgiveness
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.900]   because they have been the ones who have caused harm
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.320]   and hurt to other people.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.140]   A lot of written on there was to, you know,
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.220]   about forgiving ourselves, right?
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.180]   The different things that we struggle with,
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.340]   asking God for forgiveness.
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.220]   And in some ways, there was also a lot of requests
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.700]   asking for, you know, to be able to forgive God, right?
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.900]   Because people have felt like God has let them down.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.460]   They put their faith in God and they felt like God
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.300]   had let them down.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.080]   And I feel like I need to forgive God in some way.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.660]   And so since this was a topic that so many of us
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.120]   were wrestling with, we figured it was time
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.660]   to address this together as a church.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.460]   Because the truth is, we all need, everyone needs
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.380]   to come to a good understanding of what forgiveness is,
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.260]   of what forgiveness is and what it's supposed to look like
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.380]   because forgiveness sits at the center of God's heart.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.100]   And forgiveness is essential for our relationship with God.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.020]   In fact, without forgiveness, there would be
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.180]   no relationship with God possible, right?
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.900]   At the same time, forgiveness is also essential
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.840]   for us to be in relationship and in community
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.000]   with each other.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.800]   Without forgiveness, not even this church, right,
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.620]   society itself would totally break down
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.380]   and we would never be able to do life
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.300]   and to connect with each other.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.640]   But at the same time, as we've experienced,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.660]   it's not that simple.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.080]   Right, because forgiveness is nuanced
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.880]   with so many different questions and feelings and emotions.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.000]   And over these next few weeks, we're gonna face
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.680]   some of these questions head on.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.440]   We're gonna be talking about some theological framework
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.440]   about what forgiveness is from the biblical perspective.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.960]   We're gonna be looking at some very practical ways
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.140]   of how we can forgive, what forgiveness is
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.040]   and what forgiveness isn't.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.600]   We're gonna hear testimonies from our community groups
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.420]   about how forgiveness has been such an enriching part
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.200]   of their relationship with each other.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.880]   We're gonna talk about what it means
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.960]   for us to forgive ourselves.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.560]   And in the end, the hope is we're gonna be equipped
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.400]   to be live out, to be walking out,
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.960]   to live a life that is defined by forgiveness.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.720]   And so to start us on our journey today,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.440]   I want to look at a passage that teaches us,
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.320]   you know, that I think really Jesus uses this passage
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.880]   to highlight just how important forgiveness is
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.060]   from his perspective and how he hopes
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.040]   his followers will respond to it.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.440]   Okay, we're looking at Matthew chapter 18,
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.560]   verses 21 to 35.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.760]   I'm gonna read it and you can follow along.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.800]   Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.880]   "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.480]   "who sins against me?
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.040]   "Up to seven times?"
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.940]   Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times,
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.820]   "but 77 times.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.760]   "Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.520]   "who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.380]   "As he began the settlement, a man who owed him
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.860]   "10,000 bags of gold was brought to him.
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.500]   "Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.020]   "that he and his wife and his children
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.080]   "and all that he had to be sold to repay the debt."
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.280]   Excuse me.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.400]   "At this, the servant fell on his knees before him.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.040]   "Be patient with me, he begged,
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.320]   "and I will pay back everything.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.480]   "The servant's master took pity on him,
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.200]   "canceled the debt, and let him go.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.380]   "But when that servant went out,
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.060]   "he found one of his fellow servants
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.740]   "who owed him 100 silver coins.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.100]   "He grabbed him and began to choke him.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.800]   "'Pay back what you owe me,' he demanded.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.360]   "His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him,
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.560]   "'Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.'
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.820]   "But he refused.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.340]   "Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.820]   "until he could pay the debt.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.100]   "When the other servants saw what had happened,
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.500]   "they were outraged and went to tell the master
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.380]   "everything that had happened.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.600]   "The master then called the servant in.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.140]   "'You wicked servant,' he said.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.920]   "'I canceled all that debt of yours
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.380]   "'because you begged me to.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.660]   "'Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.180]   "'just as I had on you?'
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.260]   "In his anger, the master handed him over to the jailers
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.640]   "to be tortured until he should pay back all that he owed.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.160]   "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.160]   "unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.820]   Challenging words.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.940]   I think one of the reasons why it's challenging
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.980]   is because when we talk about forgiveness,
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.660]   initially, it's sort of like a counterproductive thing
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.580]   to do, we feel like.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.420]   It feels foreign to our natural inclinations.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.500]   It's unnatural.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.740]   Maybe that's just me.
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.140]   But when we're hurt, when we're wronged,
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.140]   we don't want to forgive.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.700]   What we want is revenge.
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.420]   What we want is revenge because we think revenge,
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.620]   getting this person back, is gonna make us feel better.
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.140]   On a micro level, this happens all the time,
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.300]   especially in Hong Kong.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.420]   We Hong Kongers, super good at passive,
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.100]   aggressive forms of revenge.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.780]   You go into MTR, someone steps on the back of your shoe.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.140]   So in the end, you find them down in the MTR
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.860]   and then you bump them with your bag
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.820]   just so you can get them back from stepping on your shoes.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.740]   Yes, feels so good to do that.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.360]   Don't ride the MTR with me.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:19.860]   But what happens, that's just a silly, trivial thing.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.560]   What happens, though, when the stakes are a bit higher?
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.620]   What kind of revenge goes through your mind
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.440]   when you think about maybe the person
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.060]   who's caused you really hurtful wounds?
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.680]   They've hurt you in almost a devastating kind of way.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.560]   How do you pay back the friend who stabbed you in the back,
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.560]   who betrayed you?
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.760]   What about the spouse or the partner that cheats on you?
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.640]   The business partner who runs off with all your money?
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.720]   A parent who abused you?
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.620]   A person who assaulted you?
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.440]   A boss or a coworker who humiliates you?
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.760]   How do we react in those kind of situations?
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.800]   I think revenge is the sort of mentality
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   that Peter is bringing here before Jesus.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.240]   When he asked the question, Lord,
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.780]   how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.400]   who sins against me?
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.920]   Up to seven times.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.120]   It's such typical Peter behavior in the Bible
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.440]   and I love how accurate and how honest the Bible is
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.800]   when it comes to the flaws of the disciples.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.880]   So close yet so far.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.360]   He seems to understand, yes, okay,
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.220]   maybe forgiveness is kind of necessary,
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.840]   but maybe it should also have a limit.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.080]   And so when Peter says up to seven times,
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.240]   from his perspective, this is going above and beyond
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.480]   what he was supposed to do.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.760]   In Jewish culture, seven is the perfect number.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.920]   So by Peter saying seven, Peter is saying,
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.720]   yes, seven, if seven is surely more than enough.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.560]   After I've forgiven seven times,
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.000]   after I've done God's will,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.720]   I should be able to take the situation
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.040]   into my own hands, right?
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.180]   Or maybe you can look at it like this.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.160]   I had an uncle who told me one time that,
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.560]   you know what, Ellison,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.880]   Jesus only says you have to turn the cheek one time.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.120]   If you turn the cheek and he hits you again,
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.920]   you have permission to slap the snot out of that person.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.360]   [congregation laughing]
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.200]   That's not true, by the way, okay?
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.800]   But that's sort of like the vibe,
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.640]   the energy that Peter is bringing into his question.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.580]   And honestly, if we were honest with ourselves
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.200]   or when I'm honest with myself,
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.120]   I wish sometimes that's the answer that Jesus gave,
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.200]   permission to fight back.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.040]   He would have said something like,
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.400]   yes, you know what, seven times,
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.100]   that's more than enough, Peter.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.440]   On the eighth time, throw hands, do what you want to do.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.600]   But he doesn't.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.160]   Instead, his response is a deep challenge to his followers
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.220]   on how we are supposed to forgive.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.080]   Jesus answered, I tell you not seven times,
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.060]   but 77 times.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.280]   Now again, it's not a formula, right?
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.440]   Jesus is not saying on the 78th time,
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.840]   you can do something about it yourself.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.320]   What Jesus means here is that there is no limit.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.040]   There is not supposed to be a limit
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.120]   to the number of times you should offer forgiveness.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.560]   In other words, if you really want to do God's will,
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.840]   don't even think about counting, just forgive.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:27.860]   Now that, my friends, is a hard pill to swallow.
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:33.960]   Because it sounds like we're just supposed to be helpless.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.600]   Right, it almost sounds like forgiveness is cheapened, right?
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.840]   It sounds as though Jesus is giving permission
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   for people just to walk all over us,
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.560]   do whatever they want to hurt us,
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.600]   and there's not a single thing we can do about it.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.120]   All we have to do is just keep forgiving
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.480]   and forgiving and forgiving.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.240]   But what if, and I'm sure many of this people room have,
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.720]   and many people listening have,
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.280]   what if we've been hurt in the most horrible of ways?
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.160]   Does God just expect me to let it go and to forget about it?
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.600]   Is this what it means to forgive?
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.360]   Because if so, it doesn't sound like it's very healthy
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.520]   for us, right?
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.440]   It doesn't sound healthy for us to live life that way,
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.080]   for the community to practice forgiveness that way.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.880]   This is not what Jesus means.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.680]   And so he tries to explain this with a parable a little bit
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.120]   to illustrate the point.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.920]   And he says it like this.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.240]   This is the story.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.160]   Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.000]   who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.240]   As he began the settlement, a man who owed him
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.600]   10,000 bags of gold was brought to him.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.240]   Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.320]   that he and his wife and his children
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.040]   and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.160]   Now this is that word debt.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.880]   Debt is such a scary word, right?
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.080]   The word itself almost sounds heavy, right?
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.280]   It's a sort of word that can fill with dread
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.120]   and panic and anxiety.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.840]   Right, in my context, it's kind of sad.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   The only letters and phone calls I have these days
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.440]   is either people telling them, right, I owe the money, right?
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.040]   So like the credit card bill comes in
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.760]   or the electricity bill comes in,
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.840]   school fees, taxes, overdue live-in charges,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.840]   all that kind of stuff, right?
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.440]   So it's I owe you money.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.600]   You're in debt to me, Ellison, in this, right?
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.960]   Or it's invitations to get into even more debt, right?
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.840]   Say hi, you know, it's like, you know,
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.320]   you're in trouble, typhoon, blah, blah, blah,
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.960]   all that kind of stuff, all those phone calls
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.080]   that you get, okay?
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:29.920]   Do you need to borrow money?
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.760]   Do you speak Chinese?
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.580]   Do you speak English?
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.240]   Okay, those kind of calls.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.600]   So debt is scary.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.720]   The scary thing about debt is because it carries
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.000]   with it consequences.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.840]   When you don't pay back your debt,
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.160]   there are consequences to your actions.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.400]   And this is what we see happening
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.180]   in this opening scene of this story.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.580]   We're told that this man, right,
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.080]   is in an unbelievable amount of debt.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.920]   10,000 bags of gold, right?
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.720]   This is a crazy, ridiculous amount of money, right?
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.240]   Some of the research I was doing, some of the commentaries,
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.220]   this would be the equivalent of billions
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.800]   or maybe even like a made-up number,
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.960]   like gazillions, okay, about of dollars.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.800]   But Jesus was doing this on purpose, right?
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.120]   He purposely uses an exaggeration to make a point.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.040]   A massive amount of money, there is no way in heaven
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.200]   or on earth that this guy will ever able
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.400]   to pay back this amount.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.920]   Not even if he lives a million lifetimes
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.200]   would he be able to pay back this amount of money.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.080]   And so it spells out the consequence.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.880]   The consequence would be that he would have
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.600]   to sell himself, his wife, and his children,
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.920]   and everything that he owed to repay the debt.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.600]   Now, I think in order for us to truly understand
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.620]   forgiveness from God's heart,
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.620]   we have to imagine ourselves in this situation a little bit.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.820]   Because the truth is, like this man who was caught up
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.360]   in debt to the king, to his master,
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.400]   we are also in debt.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   But our debt is owed to the king of kings, to God himself.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.920]   And we are in debt to God because of our sin.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.420]   Every single person is.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.920]   Scripture tells us, "All have sinned
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.400]   "and fallen short of the glory of God."
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.320]   And Scripture also tells us, "The reality is,
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   "the wages, the debt, the consequences of sin is death."
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.240]   Now, this is an idea we're gonna unpack
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.080]   a bit more clarity next week.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.260]   But essentially, it means that every one of us,
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.360]   no matter who we are, we have all sinned against God.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.040]   And because we have sinned against God,
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.220]   we owe him an insurmountable amount of debt
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.080]   that we will never, ever, ever be able to pay back.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.840]   And because of this debt, God indeed has the right
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.160]   to demand everything from us, including our lives.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.720]   Now, if the story ended here,
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.720]   it would be a bit sad, but justifiable, right?
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.560]   We owe this.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.960]   This is the situation without fail,
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.840]   every single person is in.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.560]   But the good news, the gospel is that
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.840]   this isn't where the story ends.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.400]   Right, and so Jesus tries to illustrate this
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.160]   in the way the master responds to his servant.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.840]   At this, the servant fell on his knees before him.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.560]   "Be patient with me," he begged,
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.140]   "and I will pay everything back."
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.240]   The servant's master took pity on him,
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.600]   "Cancel the debt and let him go."
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.360]   This man realizes, right, his inevitable doom.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.160]   And he tries to do everything in his own power.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.800]   He falls to his knees, he begs for surrender,
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.560]   he asks for patience and mercy.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.600]   He literally begs, "I'm gonna pay you back."
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.940]   He makes promises that he cannot keep.
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.480]   It's almost like a pathetic and hopeless pleading.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.960]   But remember, right, there is no way,
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.260]   this man knows there's no way he can pay back
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.400]   the gazillion dollars he owes his master.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.380]   And I found that sometimes that's the kind of situation
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.840]   we find ourselves in too.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.820]   When we realize our sin, when we realize
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.200]   how much in debt we are to God because of our sin,
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.580]   we end up promising God this and that, right?
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.820]   "I'm gonna be better, I'm gonna fix myself,
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.120]   "I'm gonna try and be better.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.500]   "I'm never gonna do that again,
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.940]   "I'm never gonna do this again."
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.940]   But what I found in my life is that the more I try,
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.820]   even though I try and I try and try,
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.360]   the harder I try, it's almost like the harder we fail.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.200]   And I've slowly come to the realization
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.260]   that through our own power, through our own will,
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.580]   we will never, ever, ever, ever be able
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.160]   to pay back the debt of sin.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:51.780]   And the master realizes this, and God realizes this.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.520]   And even though he has the right and authority
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.500]   to divide some sort of payment,
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.160]   something really beautiful happens.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.980]   This phrase, "The servant's master took pity on him."
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.700]   The word pity here means like love actually and compassion.
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.180]   Not because the servant has done anything
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:15.180]   to deserve a pardon, but because of the master's heart
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.980]   of love and compassion, the debt is canceled
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.640]   and he is set free.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.920]   And considering the amount of debt he was owed,
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.800]   this was unimaginable, right?
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.160]   The listeners of Jesus's time listening to this,
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.160]   were like, "This guy must be crazy
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.080]   "to just let all that money go."
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.080]   But this is the master saying, "What matters to me
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.640]   "is not the amount of money that he owes.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.440]   "I'm trying to demonstrate my heart of grace,
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.460]   "of mercy, of compassion, and of love."
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.820]   And the servant walks away in freedom.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.680]   And this is Jesus reminding us, right?
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.920]   This is an echo of God's message of forgiveness of sin.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.700]   Actually, this is a message that God has said
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.240]   time and time and time again.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.200]   We see God's heart to forgive.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.160]   Throughout the Old Testament even, Isaiah 43, 25,
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.440]   "I will blot out your transgressions."
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.740]   Jeremiah 31, 34, "I will forgive their wickedness
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.100]   "and remember their sins no more."
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.200]   Psalm 103, 12, one of my favorite passages,
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.720]   "As as far the east is from the west,
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   "so far has he removed our transgressions from us."
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   This is our starting point, church.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.180]   Never forget this.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:37.200]   God's heart is one that is inclined towards forgiveness.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.720]   His heart is one of compassion and of love.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.600]   This is what we were singing over and over and over again
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.720]   this morning, right?
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.000]   His heart is that despite the fact that we have wronged him,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.520]   we have disappointed him, we have sinned in our lives,
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.640]   we have missed the mark, we have gone against his will,
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.640]   despite that many times we make a mess of things,
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.600]   God still looks on us with love and compassion, amen?
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.640]   And God loved us so much,
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.760]   he gave us his most precious gift, his son,
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.800]   as the only way to repay the debt of sin.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.360]   God gave us his son, paying the debt of our sins
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.040]   so that we can have relationship with him.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.240]   Again, this is something we're gonna talk more about
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.060]   next week and in the weeks to come.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.000]   But what we need to understand for today is this,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.440]   is we who worship the true God are a people
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.120]   who have had all their debt forgiven
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.000]   because our master loves us.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.560]   Forgiveness, therefore, is important
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.280]   because it's the key not just to this life,
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.720]   but to eternal life as well.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.440]   This is what I mean when I say forgiveness
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.080]   sits at the very heart of God
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.440]   and encapsulates all that he came to do,
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.280]   was to offer forgiveness for you, for me,
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.560]   for anyone who asks of it.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.640]   If you are a follower of Jesus in this room today,
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.520]   you are free because you have received God's forgiveness.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.720]   Now, as a people who've understood
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.080]   and experienced this wonderful gift of forgiveness,
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.400]   you would think that we would now want to share
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.360]   this gift with others as well,
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.160]   like last week when we were talking about the gospel.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.600]   But again, it's hard and it's complicated.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.880]   It doesn't always work this way.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.360]   And for the servant on this story,
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.640]   we find that though, even though he is the one
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.040]   who has experienced the forgiveness of a great debt,
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.360]   his own heart remains unchanged.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.360]   It tells us this, but when that servant went out,
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.180]   he found one of his fellow servants
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.400]   who owed him 100 silver coins.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.480]   He grabbed him and began to choke him.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.360]   "Pay back what you owe me," he demanded.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.440]   His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him,
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.280]   "Be patient with me and I will pay it back."
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.800]   But he refused.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.080]   Instead, he went off and had that man thrown in prison
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.760]   until he could pay the debt.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.680]   You see, when this man encounters someone who owes him money,
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.160]   his heart is not full of compassion.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.140]   He remains tight-fisted and stingy about what he's owed.
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.980]   100 silver coins, okay, I said just now,
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.220]   you know that 10,000 bags of gold was like a gazillion
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.460]   dollars, 100 silver coins would have been about maybe
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.700]   the equivalent of four months wages, right,
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.120]   the Bible scholars say.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.160]   Not a small sum in and of itself, right,
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.100]   but not insurmountable as well, right?
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.000]   But compared to what he owed, right,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.580]   completely insignificant.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.880]   And this dialogue that he has, right,
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.240]   it's almost an exact replica of what just happened with him
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.720]   and his master, right, there's a debt,
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.960]   there's a falling to the knees,
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.600]   begging for patience and mercy.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.360]   But like I said, the difference is that there's no mention
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.720]   of compassion from this servant's heart.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.000]   Instead, it's the opposite.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.920]   Listen to this term, he said he refused.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.040]   When it says refused, this word means to sort of like
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.720]   harden his heart, right?
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.340]   He made a conscious decision in his mind,
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.260]   I am not willing, I'm going to make a choice
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.040]   not to forgive this person.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.100]   And actually, it gets even worse.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.940]   Not only does he refuse, but he tries to take actions
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.660]   into his own hands, right?
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.380]   He escalates, he purposely, first of all,
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.300]   goes out of his way to seek out this person who owes him.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.700]   And when he finds him, it says he physically abuses him,
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.020]   right, he grabs him and he chokes him.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.220]   He takes matters into his own hands.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:43.660]   As you read this story, you probably, as I was,
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.340]   judging this guy right now, right?
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.380]   Wow, how evil, how wicked is this man
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.920]   that he would do something like this?
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.100]   Now, before we get too judgmental of this servant,
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:00.220]   and as uncomfortable as this might make us,
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.420]   maybe we need to lean into this part of the story
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.780]   a little bit.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.700]   And I found it helpful, instead of judging it
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.380]   from the outside, to use this scenario more like a mirror
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.260]   to check my own attitude toward forgiveness.
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.660]   And maybe it's a bit more like this servant
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.700]   than we think it is.
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.940]   Because like I said just now, when we've been sinned against
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:25.540]   our first reaction is more likely inclined towards revenge.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.940]   We want to see people suffer, right,
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.080]   and get what they deserve when they sin against us.
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.580]   I admit to you in my own heart, this is often what I feel.
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.980]   I want to be able to enjoy all of God's forgiveness.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.660]   Yes, I want to be able to come to God,
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.040]   ask for his forgiveness, and receive his compassion
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.020]   and mercy and grace.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.180]   But sometimes when people sin against me,
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.740]   my first reaction is not, Father, forgive them.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.880]   My reaction is, I hope they suffer.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.820]   I hope God punished them for what they did to me.
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.660]   In fact, I hope they first, they experience 10 times worse
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.720]   than what they did to me.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.140]   That's what they deserve.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.860]   I know I'm not alone in this.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.340]   But this is precisely why this whole series
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.820]   and this conversation on forgiveness is important
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.820]   for us to have together.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.180]   Because now Jesus starts to talk about the consequences
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.440]   of our debt when we don't forgive.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.960]   Jesus needs to be saying, unless you learn to forgive
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.940]   that you have been forgiven, there are gonna be
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.640]   consequences, and these consequences affect both
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.960]   the wider community, but also your own relationship
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.760]   with God as well.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.640]   Let me tell you how it leaves a strain
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.520]   on the community, first of all.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.600]   When the other servants saw what had happened,
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.600]   they were outraged and went and told their master
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.080]   everything that has happened, that had happened.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.480]   All right, this is why I said this is a heart cry
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.320]   of the church.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.700]   This is why I said we're gonna take this journey together
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.680]   as a community, as a body of Christ,
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.140]   as a family of brothers and sisters.
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.040]   Because often when we talk about forgiveness,
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.700]   we tend to look at it individualistically.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.820]   That's just between two people.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.980]   It doesn't concern the rest of the community.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.140]   So let's say me and Derek here had beef.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.880]   We had a problem with each other.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.340]   If people find out, just leave the Eric,
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.240]   Ellison and Derek can figure that out by themselves,
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.800]   it doesn't concern us.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.160]   But actually it does.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.300]   I think as a body of Christ, we all need to agree
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.240]   that forgiveness is a poison.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.360]   And that if we don't deal with it,
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.200]   there is no way we can ever be the body of Christ
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.740]   that he has called us to be.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.660]   How are we supposed to walk alongside each other
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.520]   if we're not willing to forgive?
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.720]   How are we supposed to grow in intimacy
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.720]   if we hold grudges against each other?
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.460]   How are we gonna encourage each other
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.500]   if we keep account of what's right and what's wrong?
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.780]   Every time we've wronged and right,
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.620]   we keep an account of the rights and wrongs.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.460]   Therefore, as a community, we need to be aware of this.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.620]   And as a community, if we see unforgiveness taking place,
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.900]   we need to do something about it
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.500]   so it doesn't corrupt the rest of the body of Christ.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.000]   We need to call it out.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.860]   What also points out is the community then,
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.880]   it's supposed to be a place of safety
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.520]   and of accountability.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.060]   You see, if no one else had got involved,
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.740]   the servant would have got away with his actions.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.860]   He would have got away with abusing his debtor,
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.420]   having him thrown in jail,
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.880]   punished for something like that.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.360]   But notice, it was the other servants
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.820]   who called him out of his sin.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.100]   Right, it was the other servants,
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.380]   the community around him that flagged to the master,
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.060]   hey, something isn't quite right here.
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.800]   And we need to do and say something about it.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:58.820]   So when it comes to forgiveness,
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.580]   we see forgiveness and justice is something
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.700]   that actually go hand in hand with each other.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.260]   Forgiveness doesn't mean that one's causing harm,
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.720]   can just get away with it.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.620]   But forgiveness is what happens when a community,
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.500]   when somebody is wrong and the community around you
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.220]   comes around you to support you,
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.140]   to give you strength and power to confront the wrong
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.140]   and it's voiced out.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.000]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.540]   Community and forgiveness doesn't mean saying
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.820]   it really didn't happen, right?
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.660]   It really doesn't matter, just let it go.
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.820]   Right, in either of those cases,
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.680]   if it didn't matter, you just let it go,
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.480]   you don't need forgiveness.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.980]   Right, maybe it's just a misunderstanding
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.120]   that needs to be cleared up.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.860]   But forgiveness is the process when we admit,
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.940]   yes, something did happen, it did matter,
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.700]   something has gone wrong and we need to deal with it.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.260]   And we deal with it together as a body of Christ.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.740]   But the way we deal with it is to hand it over to God,
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.540]   to say we're not God.
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.180]   We don't get to set the standard of who is worthy
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.220]   of forgiveness or who is not.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:09.460]   We simply offer forgiveness first.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.980]   Because without that, we will never be able to move on
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.520]   as individuals and as a community.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.120]   So that's how it affects us together as a body of Christ.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.120]   On the same time though, it has an individual impact
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.060]   on us as well.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.440]   And God spells out very clearly the results
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.180]   of withholding forgiveness.
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.860]   Then the master called the servant in.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.180]   You wicked servant, he said.
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:42.140]   I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.820]   Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.180]   just as I had on you?
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.660]   In his anger, the master handed him over to the jailers
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:53.940]   to be tortured until he should pay back all that he owed.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.900]   This is how my heavenly father will treat each of you
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.780]   unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:05.280]   Again, this sounds harsh.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.460]   But I think the point scripture is trying to make is this.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.700]   It might seem like when we don't offer forgiveness,
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:15.820]   that we hold onto the power, that we hold onto the control.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.900]   But when in reality, what Jesus is saying is
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.320]   when we withhold forgiveness,
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.080]   it's actually a great detriment to us.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:28.280]   It seems like the other person is getting what they deserve.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.900]   But in reality, what we're doing is condemning ourselves.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.700]   You might know the old saying,
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.940]   unforgiveness is like drinking a poison
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.900]   and expecting the other person to die.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.580]   Right, so it has really, really serious consequences
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.940]   for ourselves if we withhold forgiveness.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.780]   Maybe you could think about it this way.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.460]   We're gonna do a little exercise together.
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.720]   Okay, on the count of three,
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.660]   I want everybody to take a deep breath.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.420]   Okay, when you take a deep breath,
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.700]   hold it in for as long as you can.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.940]   Right, try and hold your breath, okay?
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.700]   One, two, three.
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.980]   [inhales]
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:23.340]   Some of us might be able to do this for longer, right?
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.500]   But you're probably feeling a struggle to breathe now, right?
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.260]   To breathe out that breath.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.420]   Right, none of us, nobody in this room
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.880]   is able to hold their breath forever.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.900]   You would either pass out
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.500]   or if you really did just stop breathing altogether,
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.380]   you would die.
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:42.820]   In order for you to take your next breath,
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.840]   you have to release the breath you're holding.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.380]   And so it is with forgiveness.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.860]   If we want to receive forgiveness,
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.660]   we need to be able to release forgiveness to others as well.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:04.540]   Like I said, though, this is the starting point.
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:08.300]   Right, this is just the introduction to this journey.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.100]   And there's no way we can unpack and discover
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.340]   all the things that forgiveness means for us
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.440]   in one short sermon on a Sunday morning.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.380]   So I want to encourage everybody here.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.220]   Please try to come along, right,
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.660]   to the next few messages that we have,
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.300]   to the next few Sundays that we have
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.100]   in this journey of forgiveness.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.160]   And this is not about, you know,
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.780]   like maintaining numbers at the vine
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:33.620]   or anything like that, right?
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.780]   It's not about that.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.180]   But what this is, it's for your wholeness.
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.860]   It's for your understanding.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.100]   It's for you to really be able to embrace
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.540]   what forgiveness means so you can walk
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.520]   in the freedom of forgiveness.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.820]   After all, Jesus taught us to pray.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:55.620]   Forgive our sins as we forgive those
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.800]   who have sinned against us.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:03.580]   And my heart is, as individuals,
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.980]   but also as a community, we will embrace
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.420]   this journey of forgiveness together.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.060]   To step by step, learn what it means
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:15.340]   to receive and to give out what forgiveness
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.080]   really means in God's heart.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.340]   This is how we build, continue the kingdom of God
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.580]   here on this earth.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:27.400]   So would you pray with me as we start this journey together?
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.660]   [coughing]
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:45.200]   Jesus, we know that this is an issue
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.960]   that many of us are wrestling with.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.080]   And even if we're not wrestling with it
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.400]   right at this moment, there is gonna come a time
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.320]   where we've been wronged and we need to offer forgiveness.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.080]   Or someone wrongs us, or we wrong someone else
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.340]   and we need to be forgiven.
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:09.400]   And so Lord, I thank you that.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.560]   Our starting point, Lord, is that you have already
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.240]   poured forgiveness out for us.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.120]   That you have offered forgiveness to us
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.620]   despite our sin, despite the ways that we've missed
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.200]   the mark when it comes to being in relationship
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.040]   with you, Lord.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.760]   You've given us everything we need,
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.820]   your most precious gift so that we can have forgiveness.
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.800]   Lord, as we receive this gift, Lord,
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:42.940]   we hear that you've also asked us to pour it out
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.580]   to those who have wronged us.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:50.480]   And I know this is a hard journey for some of us to take.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.220]   You might be thinking right now,
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.040]   if you only knew the pain that I've been through,
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.380]   what this person did to me, how that person hurt me.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:12.020]   And Father, we know that you meet us
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.440]   in those areas of pain.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:21.120]   And so Jesus, I pray that through your gentle guidance
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.900]   in the way that only you know how you would teach us
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.700]   how to forgive.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:32.580]   That as we embrace forgiveness in our own hearts,
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.180]   it would soften our hearts.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:44.740]   And as we learn to live a life defined by forgiveness,
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.880]   we will reflect your gospel, your grace,
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.420]   your mercy to everybody.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:52.820]   And that even together as a community,
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:56.460]   we can keep encouraging each other in this journey,
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.580]   keep encouraging each other to not keep things hidden,
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.060]   but to bring it out into the light when there's been sin,
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.620]   when there's been wrong in the community.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:10.620]   We will not let that just be swept under the carpet.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.640]   But Lord, because we know the proper way
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.020]   to deal with these things, we can walk with it together.
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.020]   And that this forgiveness that we offer to each other
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.720]   reflects, truly reflects the heart that you have for us.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.380]   So Lord, be with us the next few weeks
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:33.100]   as we walk through this.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.200]   Encourage us, strengthen us, guide us.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.540]   We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:41.120]   (gentle music)
