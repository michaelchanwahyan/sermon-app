[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I'm not enough unless you come.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.760]   Lord we just declare before you as a church this morning that we are not enough.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.520]   That our voices are not enough.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.880]   Our vision is not enough.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.280]   Our strategies are not enough.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.360]   Our music is not enough.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.080]   Our preaching is not enough.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.800]   We need you.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.320]   We are nothing, nothing without you.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.320]   And Lord we confess dry bones.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.200]   I wonder if you just take a moment where you're at just before the Lord.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.160]   If you're feeling dry, there's an area of weariness.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.820]   There's just something that's maybe going on in your relationship, in your life.
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.040]   Maybe in your workplace, a sphere of influence you have.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.960]   And you know that you're in need of the power of the Spirit of God.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.880]   The power of the Spirit of God.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.480]   I wonder whether you'd just bring dry places to Him.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.080]   Father, we stand together as a community of faith on behalf of the brothers and sisters
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.080]   in this room.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.120]   Lord, I want to speak out over marriages that are broken in the name of Jesus.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.480]   Where there's dryness between spouses in this place.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.280]   Lord, would you bring your Holy Spirit, because we are nothing without you.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.920]   Lord, we pray for areas in our lives that feel broken at this time.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.360]   Maybe struggling with some sickness, or maybe it's fear, anxiety in our hearts.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.760]   Lord, we bring it to you.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.680]   We say that in our own strength, all our strategies are not enough.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.040]   Lord, we need you.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.360]   Would you awaken dry bones, Lord?
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.160]   In our workplaces, where people are crying out for hope in this time and in this hour
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   in Hong Kong.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.400]   Lord, would you open our mouths?
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.840]   Would you open our lives?
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.240]   Would we say something, Lord, of the hope that is found?
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.560]   Lord, take the dry bones in us, Lord.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   And Father, we declare this over the church in this city.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.320]   You know, there are some aspects of church and in church history where they would say,
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.680]   "Man, that outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Acts 2, that was just for those people.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.040]   Or that was just to get the church going.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.520]   That was just to bring the fire for the first missionaries."
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.880]   And God doesn't move like that.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.120]   And I stand where I stand in my city today.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.160]   And I see all the needs that we have.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.120]   I see the giants that are around us.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.800]   I see the things that are taking place in our world right now.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.600]   I see the rise of violence between different nations.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.160]   I see nationalism, totalitarian leadership.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.280]   I see racism like it's never been seen before.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.320]   And we stand on Pentecost Sunday and we say it's not just for those people in the first
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   century.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.080]   We have our dry bones today, Holy Spirit.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.220]   And we ask, Lord, that you would pour out on every single church in our city, Lord.
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.840]   You would pour out today on the people who are hungry and in need, Lord.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.640]   You would pour out today, Lord, on the injustices around us, Holy Spirit.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:23.440]   Lord, in our time, in our hour, Lord, we need you.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.680]   Lord, we are not going to do this in our own strength.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.920]   And so, Father, we thank you.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.160]   We thank you that your Spirit is the only thing that makes us different.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.640]   Your death and resurrection is the only thing that makes us different.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.360]   Lord, we want to hold forth resurrection life.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.000]   Lord, we need it in our own lives.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.760]   Father, we thank you for that gift.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.200]   Lord, as we open your word, oh, Father, as we come to your word today, we do not come
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.880]   at a distance.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.560]   We do not come wanting our ears to be tickled.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.720]   But we come opening your scripture, believing that your word has power, that your word has
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.280]   something to say to this moment, to this city, that, Lord, your word has something to say
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.640]   to my life and my marriage and my workplace and my relationships.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.920]   And so, Lord, we open your word with our hearts saying, "What is there for me today?
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.100]   How, Lord, do you want to uproot, tear down, destroy, overthrow, plant and build in me
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.280]   today, Lord?"
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.480]   And so, Father, we come hungry to be changed.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:52.960]   We ask that you would move by your Spirit, that you would sit on us, convict us, heal
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.600]   us, restore us.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.520]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.520]   Amen.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.560]   Let me thank our worship team just every week, serving so much.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.840]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.840]   Welcome to the Vine.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.400]   If you're new online, welcome to you guys.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   It's great to have you with us.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.200]   If you're new in this room as well, we are so glad you are here.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.320]   You know, the Holy Spirit moves in a lot of different ways.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.280]   One of the ways the Scriptures speak about the Spirit of God is that it comes to bring
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.640]   conviction.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.760]   And as I was preparing this message today and as I was in this worship time, I know
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:56.520]   that I can't start my message this morning without confessing something to you.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.120]   In 2019, I did not like God very much.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.920]   If you've been here at the Vine for a season, for a time, you may know the story about me
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.640]   and my family in 2019.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.720]   In March of 2019, my father passed away all of a sudden, very suddenly, within two weeks,
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.440]   through a very quick and painful battle with liver cancer.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.680]   And that whole experience completely shook my world and turned me upside down.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.720]   And I was wrestling with the reality that I was so angry at God for taking my father
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.560]   from me so quickly.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.160]   And I was feeling so much bitterness.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.840]   I was sitting in that tension between not being able to reconcile the suffering that
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.040]   I was experiencing in my life and the idea of a good and loving God.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.760]   I wonder if anyone else in this room has ever felt that way.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.040]   Where because of stuff that's happening in our lives, we can't reconcile what we've always
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.560]   believed, what we've always thought, what we've always known about God.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.840]   And I couldn't bring these two things together.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.600]   And I was a senior pastor of a church.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.480]   And I realized that actually I was very much like the older son in the parable of the prodigal
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.160]   son.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.520]   And in those weeks and months just after my father passed, I was angry at God and I was
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.640]   saying, "God, why is it?
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.920]   Why is it that I slave away for you?
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.400]   I built a church for you.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.480]   This church has not been easy to create, to build, to pastor, to lead.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.320]   I have sacrificed many hours.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.600]   I've sacrificed personal relationships for this thing and you take my father from me.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.480]   Couldn't you throw me some blessings, God?
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:49.720]   I think I deserve a little bit more from you, God."
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.280]   And I was finding myself not being able to reconcile this reality.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:02.920]   And then I was coming to church on Sundays and I felt like a fraud before you.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:10.360]   Because I was preaching messages and I was leading services and I didn't have inside
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:17.400]   of me a healthy relationship with God.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:25.920]   And I know that by God's grace, He can bless that, but I know that it was wrong.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.920]   And here was the greatest fear I was carrying.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:34.280]   The greatest fear was not that I would suck or that the church would go backwards and
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.920]   disintegrate.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:43.200]   My greatest fear was that no one would actually know, that I could actually get away with
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:51.920]   it, that I could act spiritual without actually being spiritual.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.640]   My greatest fear was that I would be able to get up in front of you on a Sunday and
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.520]   go through the motions of being a Christian when I knew in my heart that I was very far
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.320]   from where I had been with Jesus.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.260]   And I knew that that was a dangerous place to be.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:15.500]   And yet in that season of my life, I did that weekend after weekend after weekend and it
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.920]   wasn't right.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.940]   And that wasn't the worst of it.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.740]   Here was the worst of it.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:33.640]   The worst of it was I convinced myself that the way to get my relationship back with God
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:41.020]   was by just trying to push into this doing thing, trying to push into just the activities
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:46.280]   of my faith, trying to kind of be a pastor, be that better person, preach the best message,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.140]   go to that event, do all this stuff, give more money to the church.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:10:00.180]   I tried to in my activity, find a way to restore what was actually broken in my relationship.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:06.660]   I looked to the activity of my Christianity to be my salvation and completely left God,
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.560]   my Savior, out of it.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.820]   Are you with me?
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:16.780]   I thought that if I could just act like a Christian more, that if I could say the right
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:22.180]   things, raise my hands right, sing the right words, say the right prayers, that in somehow
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.380]   that might cover for the reality that I'm not willing and I'm not yet able to come before
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:36.460]   God and say, "This is broken and I'm upset with you and I need to humble myself and come
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.260]   before you afresh."
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:47.500]   It wasn't right and I can't preach the message that I want to preach today without coming
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.020]   before you first and asking for you to forgive me.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.620]   I look back on those times and by God's grace, He moved the church forward and people were
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.780]   saved, but that's not the point.
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.580]   The point is I led you falsely and that's not right.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.820]   So I want to confess that to you.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.380]   I want to ask that you would forgive me.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.460]   I want to ask my elders, I've got some elders here in this service, if they would forgive
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.460]   me.
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.700]   I didn't tell anyone about it.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.140]   I just did it.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:24.660]   I put on the front of being a Christian and I didn't have the relationship with Jesus.
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.860]   So I hope that you would forgive me.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:34.740]   What I want to say to us today I think is a significant word for our church, but also
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.760]   for this city right now.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:44.020]   Because I want to speak into the reality that so often I think this is our greatest danger,
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.420]   that we over-emphasize the doing for Jesus and we forget about the being with Jesus.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:57.500]   And that when we do that, we put ourselves in a position to become powerless.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.400]   Here's the thing I'm sensing in my spirit.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:08.100]   That in the time of Hong Kong's history where God wants the church in this city to rise
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:14.140]   up in its authority and its power and to bring the hope of the gospel to a broken city that
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:20.460]   is in search of its identity, in that very season, the enemy is releasing the greatest
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:29.060]   strategy that he has to try to rip and steal the power and the authority out of the church.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.220]   And I want to open up for you what I think that strategy is, and I want to call it out
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.820]   of me and I want to call it out of you.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.260]   And I don't pretend to think that my sin is your sin.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:45.580]   But what I do know is this, that because of what I went through in 2019 and the process
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.620]   that God has taken me through in my life, I can stand before you today and say we have
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.740]   to watch out.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:58.860]   We have to be careful that we as the Hong Kong church doesn't get so consumed in the
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:05.260]   activity for God that we completely release ourselves from any true lasting relationship
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.260]   with God.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:17.020]   And if we do that, we are powerless in the very time when God needs the church the most.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:24.820]   I want to stand before you today and say this will not happen on our watch.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.180]   But it did happen on Moses' watch.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:35.180]   And we're continuing our series in a different spirit and we're looking at numbers 13 and
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:40.100]   14 and in this passage of scripture, there's so much in there throughout this whole story.
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.100]   There's so much that has been there.
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.340]   We've seen all this amazing stuff, but there's this passage right at the end, this passage
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.780]   that doesn't get read very often.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.380]   In fact, on my Bible, it's over the next page.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:55.260]   And when you know when it's on the next page, you very rarely get there.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.540]   And we've seen all of numbers 13 and 14, the giants and the grapes, all the great stuff
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.620]   that's happened.
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.540]   We've seen all of the stuff that's taken place and how Moses has had to come and call them
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.100]   to account for their sin.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.220]   We've seen God forgive them.
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.700]   We've seen them get restored and yet see consequences of their sin.
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.540]   We've seen the whole heartedness that promise talked about last week.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.620]   All of that is there.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.940]   And then we think that's the end of the story and everything's good.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.180]   And then this happens.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:27.380]   It's like the epilogue to the story, the thing that isn't preached on very often, but the
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.180]   thing that I think the whole story is actually about.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.540]   Let me read this to us.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.380]   Numbers 14, verse 36.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.620]   So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.980]   grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.940]   These men responsible for spreading that bad report about the land were struck down and
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.300]   died of a plague before the Lord.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:57.740]   Of the men who went up to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.460]   survived.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:04.020]   When Moses reported this all to the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:09.340]   Early the next morning, they went up towards the high hill country.
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.460]   We have sinned, they said.
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.640]   We will go up to the place that the Lord has promised.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.440]   But Moses said, why are you disobeying the Lord's command?
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.100]   This will not succeed.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.180]   Do not go up because the Lord is not with you.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.560]   You will be defeated by your enemies.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.340]   For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.780]   And because you have turned away from the Lord, he will not be with you and you will
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.220]   fall by the sword.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.700]   Nevertheless, in their presumption, they went up towards the high hill country.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:46.380]   Though neither Moses nor the ark of the Lord's covenant moved from the camp.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.500]   Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who had lived in that hill country came down and
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:55.820]   attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormat.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.140]   This is the end of the story.
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.340]   It's the end of the whole thing with the promised land and the spies and everything.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.680]   And we get right to the end of it.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.660]   And Israel has learned nothing.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.020]   I mean, here's Israel.
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.660]   And they've seen all the things that have unfolded.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.120]   They've heard through Moses, God calling out their sin.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.820]   And now they've literally witnessed the 10 spies, the men who had gone into that promised
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.580]   land and come back with a bad report.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:25.260]   They've literally watched them be killed with plagues in front of them.
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:30.780]   And no wonder this creates a bitterness in the camp, a mourning, a kind of sense of fear
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.780]   amongst them.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.100]   And I want you to see what they do out of their fear in verse 40.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.540]   "Earlier the next morning, they went up to the high hill country."
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.540]   That's the promised land.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.180]   "We have sinned," they said.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.060]   And because we have sinned, we will go to the place that the Lord promised.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.060]   I want you to see what Israel's doing here.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.860]   They've not learned anything.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.820]   They've realized that they've sinned, that they've done wrong in the Lord's eyes.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:02.900]   And they think, like I did in 2019, that the way to repair their relationship with God
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.580]   is to go into the promised land.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:10.100]   That was the thing that got us into trouble to begin with, that we didn't think it was
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.780]   right for us to go into the promised land.
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.740]   We know that the promised land is God's will.
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.460]   And we've sinned.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:22.020]   And without even thinking, without even checking their hearts, without even wondering where
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:27.980]   their relationship with God is, they just think if they do the activities of God, then
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.460]   that's going to somehow create a favor in them that God will bless them and they'll
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.220]   be able to restore the very thing that is broken.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.380]   I want you to see what they're doing here.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:49.780]   They're actually trying to repair their broken hearts through doing God's will without relationship
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:54.180]   with God.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:18:00.140]   They think that their right actions will repair their wrong hearts.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:06.040]   They think that their strength is what will do it, when actually it will only ever happen
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.740]   through their humility.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.960]   Come on, church.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.340]   They think that if they could just get into that promised land, if they could just physically
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.340]   do the stuff that God wants, then everything's going to be okay.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:25.020]   And they've completely lost the plot because they thought that their sin was that they
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.860]   didn't act in the promised land.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:33.340]   And so they think that the way to repair that sin is by acting in the promised land.
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.980]   And I want you to see how Moses responds to this kind of thinking.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.540]   He goes, "Why are you still disobeying the Lord's command?"
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.540]   Verse 41.
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.060]   "This will not succeed.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.540]   Don't go up because the Lord is not with you.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.740]   You will be defeated by your enemies."
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.940]   There it is.
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.940]   This is not going to work.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.140]   You're going to get defeated.
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.140]   This is the wrong way to go about it.
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.140]   Why?
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.140]   Right at the beginning of verse 42.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:02.940]   "Do not go up because the Lord is not with you.
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.580]   Your relationship with Him is not being repaired.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.300]   You are not on the same page.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.660]   He's not with you.
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.980]   You are not with Him."
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:16.580]   And you're thinking that your action is going to repair something that actually can only
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:23.660]   be repaired through your humility, through you actually confessing what is truly wrong,
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:29.460]   that you've given up on your relationship with God, and instead you've become consumed
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.260]   by the doing of God.
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.260]   Is anybody here?
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.260]   Hmm.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.540]   This is a great challenge.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.580]   The Israelites' faulty thinking is this.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:48.860]   They think it's that the activity will create the relationship, when it's actually the relationship
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.300]   that creates the activity.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.380]   Are you with me?
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.500]   They think that if they could just do, act, and sing, if they could just go to more services,
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.740]   raise their hands and sing the right songs, if they just had found the right prayers to
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:04.580]   pray, surely God will forgive them and begin to love them again.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.020]   And Moses is saying, "No, no.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.580]   Your thinking is wrong because God's not with you, and if He's not with you, no amount of
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.380]   activity is going to work.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:19.220]   You got to humble yourself and come back to Him.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:24.500]   You got to be more than you're going to do."
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:29.720]   Here's the warning for us, and here's the thing that I got wrong in 2019.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:36.580]   We have to be really careful that our activities for God doesn't outweigh our relationship
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.580]   with God.
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.180]   Are you with me?
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.260]   We got to be really careful.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.540]   Now, listen to me.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.620]   I'm not saying that activity is wrong in and of itself.
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.780]   I'm not saying that activity never helps.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.540]   We all know that we deepen and create and grow our relationship through really good
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.540]   spiritual disciplines.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.740]   There are activities in God, of course, but we got to make sure that the balance of the
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:03.200]   scales that our activities for God doesn't outweigh our relationship with God.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.220]   When that happens, here's what will take place in your life.
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:11.540]   You will end up doing God's will, but your way.
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.820]   Come on.
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.220]   You'll end up doing God's will, but your way.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.620]   That's exactly what Israel do.
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.580]   Going into the promised land was God's will.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.780]   Taking that land was God's will.
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.860]   Finding a place of milk and honey, a place of flourishing and growth was all on the heart
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.860]   of God.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:34.900]   But Israel are still in their self-centered rebellion in front of God, because they want
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.660]   to do the will of God their way.
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:45.940]   See, it's bad enough if you want to do your will your way, but it's just as dangerous
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.820]   for you to do God's will your way.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.340]   It's got to be God's will, God's way.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.200]   They got the timing completely wrong.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.220]   They had the right idea, the wrong timing.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.900]   They had the right action, the wrong motive.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.180]   And they would have known that if they had been connected in relationship with God, if
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.940]   they had been building that heart, the whole heartedness that promise spoke about last
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.940]   week.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:20.020]   If that was at work in them, then they wouldn't have made this mistake, but it wasn't.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.980]   When we find ourselves doing this, here's what takes place.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:31.820]   We think we can get the blessings and the promises of God simply by just doing rather
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:32.820]   than being.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:38.940]   I want you to understand this, that we are never going to get the blessings of God that
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.940]   way.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:46.940]   That actually it's more like this, that every single time we try to do God's will our way,
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.960]   we cannot hope to reap the same blessings.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:56.180]   You can't expect to move into the promised land in your timing, in your agenda, in your
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.660]   ways, even if the promised land is what God's got.
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:05.580]   And so Moses stands back and he says, "If you go in there without God being with you,
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:06.820]   you will be defeated.
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.700]   It will not work out for you."
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.460]   And so we stand in this moment right here in Hong Kong's history, and I think this is
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.180]   a great challenge for the church in our city.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.060]   We've been saying in this series, haven't we, that this is an important hour for us
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.060]   to be in.
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:25.420]   We've been saying in this series that Hong Kong is God's promised land, that this is
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:30.220]   a place that flows with milk and honey, that there are hundreds and thousands and millions
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.260]   of people that need to know Jesus in this place, that we're in a critical time of Hong
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.980]   Kong's history where it's asking about its identity.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.340]   It wants to know more about who it is.
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:44.860]   It's struggling with the realities of giants and graves, and we've got the answer.
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.500]   And we've been saying in this series that we must get this different spirit in us like
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:54.540]   Caleb and Joshua to be able to stand up in this time and in this hour, and we believe,
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:24:00.180]   just like Moses says over the people, the land is still exceedingly good.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.180]   Amen?
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:09.300]   The danger will be that we will try to accomplish in Hong Kong God's will our way, that we'll
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.980]   try to bring it about in our own strength, that we'll listen to a series like this and
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.820]   get so pumped up and say, "Yeah, I'm going to go and change the world for Jesus," and
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.660]   we leave Jesus behind.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:29.060]   And we get ahead of Him, thinking that as long as I act and be and do like Him, that
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:35.700]   everything's going to be okay, and God stands over here, and He's like, "I'm waiting.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:42.820]   Waiting for you to be with Me, because that's what I want, but we need to do it together."
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.060]   Here's what the enemy's going to do.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.860]   The enemy is designed to do this.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.860]   This is a strategy over you.
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:56.340]   He wants to cause you to put the doing over the being.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:02.180]   The enemy wants to turn your Christianity into a sociology.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:09.340]   He wants you to actually embrace Christian ideas, Christian morals, Christian ethics.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:16.460]   He would love you to live like a Christian, devoid of your relationship with Jesus.
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:21.980]   He would want for you to actually think that you are a Christian and not actually engage
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.820]   in the reality of a relationship with God.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:30.860]   If the enemy can push the church into activity after activity and away from relationship,
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.300]   the enemy will create a powerless church.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:39.460]   Let me put it this way.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:47.340]   The enemy wants to take Christ out of Christianity and create what I like to call secular believers,
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:52.860]   those who claim the name of Jesus but are without the authority that comes from a relationship
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.340]   with Jesus.
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.100]   That's what the Church of Hong Kong needs to be aware of, that we would claim to be
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:05.820]   people of Jesus, but we don't have the authority that comes from a relationship with Jesus.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:12.020]   In 2019, I claimed to be your senior pastor, but I did not have the authority in me that
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:17.100]   comes from a relationship with Jesus, and I have to repent of that.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.020]   And I wonder, that was me in 2019.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.780]   I wonder what's going on for you in 2021.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:28.340]   I wonder whether you've made it a habit of embracing Christian ideals and Christian ethics
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.660]   and all of these things.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.980]   I wonder if you're trying to live in obedience to Scripture and you're trying to be that
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:40.020]   way without actually having an ongoing, deepening, intimate relationship with Jesus.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:44.420]   Let me tell you, it is possible.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:49.260]   And the enemy will cover our eyes from seeing that reality, and that's why I feel like this
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.380]   message is important.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:59.380]   There is no authority in activity alone.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.940]   Come on, church.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.340]   There's no authority in activity alone.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.060]   Where does the authority come from?
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.220]   Let's have a look at what Moses says.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.220]   Verse 44.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.220]   Is this helping anyone?
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.220]   Anyone awake still?
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.220]   You okay?
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.220]   Upper house?
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.220]   Online?
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:19.980]   I see you checking Instagram right now.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:29.260]   Put that down in the name of Jesus.
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.260]   Verse 44.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.140]   "Nevertheless, in their presumption, they went up towards the high hill country, though
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.580]   neither Moses nor the ark of the Lord's covenant moved from the camp."
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.580]   I want you to notice this.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.420]   The author is saying, "Here's how it all went wrong.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.700]   They went ahead to do the things of God, but they left God behind.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.260]   But Moses and the ark of the covenant never moved from the camp."
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:55.420]   You need to realize that this represents the authority of God amongst Israel.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.180]   If you look at the Exodus narrative in the wilderness, that ark of the covenant where
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:05.140]   the tablets were found, created as it was, the tent of tabernacle, the tent of meeting,
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:09.780]   created as it was, was a physical sign to the people that the presence of God was with
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.780]   them.
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:14.220]   The pillar of fire, the cloud at night, it was a way for them to know God's presence
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.340]   is with them.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:20.260]   And not just His presence, but in Moses and Aaron, they had the mouthpiece of God amongst
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.260]   them.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.620]   That Moses and Aaron would hear from the heart of God and translate and bring that to Israel.
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:32.340]   So both in the presence represented by the ark and in the word represented by Moses and
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.860]   Aaron, you have the authority of God.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.100]   Are you with me?
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.180]   So Israel's authority was not in their armies.
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.140]   It was not in their strength.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.120]   It was not in their great strategy to take the promised land.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:48.220]   It was only in the authority that comes through the presence of God.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.900]   Will you be with us?
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.300]   If only you are with us, will we succeed in the promised land?
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.500]   We could do all that we want in our own strength to be in the promised land, even though it
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:06.140]   might be your will, but if you're not with us, we will be defeated.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.220]   And so it is for us in our city right now.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.580]   It's really important we understand this.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.100]   Our authority as the church in Hong Kong will not come in the years ahead because we are
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.300]   the right ones.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.700]   It will not come because we have better morals than everyone else.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.620]   It won't come because we have a certain political persuasion.
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.620]   It will not come because we're great peacemakers and reconcilers.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:31.180]   It's not even going to come because we have great church services, as important as all
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.500]   that is.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.820]   It only comes through Christ and Christ aligned.
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.480]   That's where our authority is.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:45.440]   Those with a different spirit are people that don't do God's will their way.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.920]   They are people that don't pretend to be Christians.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:55.580]   Let me say this, there is no power in acting like a Christian.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.520]   Come on church, some of you need to hear that today.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:04.360]   There's no power in just living under Christian ethics and morals.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:11.940]   A different spirit says, "The most important thing to me is knowing Jesus."
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:16.080]   And yes, there are activities that are involved in that and those are good.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.120]   But my relationship with Jesus is paramount.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:26.720]   I will not move forward unless it's God's will and God's way.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.520]   And to understand His will and His way, the only way I come to understand that for me,
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.080]   for my marriage, for my workplace, for the gifts God's given me, for my church at the
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:41.040]   Vine, for my city in Hong Kong, the only way I know that is if I'm in relationship with
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   Him.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:48.280]   And so I'm calling us in this message back to relationship with Jesus, particularly for
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.680]   those of us in this room that know that you've drifted.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:31:03.880]   And some of us in this room, like me in 2019, are pretending and that is stripping the church
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.600]   of its authority.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.740]   That's a hard word.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:14.560]   And I can say that because I've lived it.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.900]   How did I heal?
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.900]   How can you heal?
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.120]   Two minutes, are you ready?
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.280]   Doesn't happen in two minutes, but I'm going to share it in two minutes.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.880]   I went into my sabbatical in 2019.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.440]   I actually had a sabbatical before I knew my father was sick and my father passed away.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.880]   We already had a sabbatical for me.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.320]   I'd been working here for 10 years.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.480]   It was a gift, four months off.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.760]   It's interesting, isn't it, that what I needed, I was, remember, I was trying to gain my relationship
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:45.440]   back with God by entering into the promised land in my way, right?
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.200]   Thinking that activity would replace relationship.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.200]   God gives me a sabbatical.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.240]   The very definition of sabbatical is no activity.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.080]   God knows what I needed.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.840]   I was going to go into sabbatical and go to churches every Sunday that I did not know,
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.440]   sit in pews that I would never sit in again, completely anonymous from everybody in that
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.640]   room, and it was going to be glorious.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.400]   Before I went on sabbatical, a mentor of mine took me aside.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.480]   He says, "Andrew, do you know how the Bible ends?"
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.720]   I'm like, "Yes, I do.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.320]   Let me prove to you."
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.360]   Revelations 21, 22, oh, the New Jerusalem.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.080]   God brings this New Jerusalem down from the sky.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.080]   It's like heaven comes to earth.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.200]   There's only one river, only one tree, no longer good and evil, just healing for all
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   the nations.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.680]   It's wonderful, and everybody, even the trees clap their hands.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.680]   My friend was like, "Hmm, okay."
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.680]   No, he wasn't like that.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.680]   He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:43.760]   I know all that stuff, but do you know how actually the Bible ends?
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.360]   Do you know what the last words are in Scripture?"
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   I thought about it for a second.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.360]   I said, "Yeah, yeah, I do, actually.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.480]   It's 'Maranatha, come Lord Jesus.'"
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.280]   My friend grabbed the Bible, and he's like, "Isn't that awesome?"
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.960]   The Bible itself is the story of the activities of God on earth.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.320]   The Bible is God's heart for redemption.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.880]   The Bible is all about what it is to get saved and see shalom take place in the world.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.320]   You get all the way through all of this incredible activity.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:15.400]   You get to the end of Revelations 21 and 22, and you see God complete all of the works
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.520]   that He has to do in everything in creation.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:27.000]   And then, after everything else has ceased, there's still one thing left, relationship,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.600]   being overdoing.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.000]   That even after all of that incredible activity, we get to the end of the Bible, and the writer
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.240]   decides to say this to us, "There is always more of Jesus."
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.560]   And our posture is invitation.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:49.240]   "Maranatha, come Lord Jesus."
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:56.440]   My friend, my mentor, put his hand on my shoulder, and he says, "Go into your sabbatical.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   Cease your activity.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.200]   Maranatha."
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.000]   Some of you in this room, that's a word in season for you.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.640]   The Holy Spirit, if this message is saying something to you today, if you recognize that
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:15.000]   you are at times pretending to be a Christian in the hopes that your relationship will catch
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.520]   up, if you realize that it's been some time now since you've actually had that deeper
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:28.200]   intimacy with Jesus, can I say to you, maybe can I put a metaphorical hand on your shoulder
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:35.600]   today, and simply say to you, "Maranatha, our healing comes from a place of both repentance
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:39.600]   and invitation, to repent and invite."
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.000]   Susanne talked about this a few weeks ago, repentance is actually life to us.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.720]   It gives us and brings us into life.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:52.240]   And some of us in this room, like I needed to in 2019, need to come before the Lord and
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:35:00.480]   repent, to say this was not right, that what's going on in my life right now is not right,
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.160]   and I'm willing, Lord, to say so.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:08.800]   I don't want to be like the Israelites that jump ahead of your timing and your will and
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   your way.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:14.040]   I want your will and your way for my life and for this city, and I recognize that I'm
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.520]   not in the right place, so would you come?
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:23.360]   And if you say sorry, don't just say sorry, but invite God to be with you again.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.000]   Welcome Him.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.800]   The Israelites had to wander for 40 years in the wilderness to get that process of repentance
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.640]   in their heart right before they could finally enter the promised land.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:39.280]   I had four months where I would go on these hikes all the time, and I didn't know what
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.280]   to say to God.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.440]   I didn't even really feel like talking to Him, but I could hear my mentor, and I would
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.840]   go on these walks, and I'd be like, "Maranatha, Maranatha, Maranatha, Maranatha."
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.240]   I didn't even say it in a positive way.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.000]   I was like, "Maranatha, Maranatha."
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.620]   But yet in some faithfulness of saying, "Actually, I'm right here at the need of welcoming Jesus
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:03.160]   into my life again, I found my healing."
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.600]   You know what?
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:09.320]   I can stand here in 2021 proud to be leading this church.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.680]   I can stand here in front of you not with a perfect relationship with Jesus, but with
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.560]   a Caleb spirit in me because of what I went through in 2019.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.560]   I can stand before you and say, "I've got hope for this city," and really believe it.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.960]   I can stand before you and say, "I'm not afraid of the giants," and really mean it.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.000]   I can stand before you and say, "I'm going to say things in the pulpit and write things
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.600]   in the newspaper because I am courageous about the gospel."
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.520]   I can stand before you and say, "I believe that this is the church's hour to rise up
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520]   in the city."
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.520]   Why?
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:45.960]   Because I know what it's like to try to do God's way my way.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.420]   And I've had to face the reality of that, confess my sin, get healed by him, and find
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:56.360]   myself in a place of relationship again, and for you as well.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:04.080]   Moses says to God during the Exodus, "If you don't go with us, how will anybody know that
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.620]   we're different?
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.940]   How is there any hope if your presence isn't with us?
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.540]   If you're not for us or with us, how will they know your love, your compassion, your
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.540]   kindness?
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.940]   It has to be your presence and your spirit.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.420]   We refuse to go forward without you."
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:24.380]   I wonder whether a cry would rise up on the church in Hong Kong in this hour and say,
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.860]   "We will not go forward without you.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.820]   Believe us when we are not with you.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.820]   We come."
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.820]   Maranatha.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.820]   Come, Lord Jesus.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.820]   Can I pray for us?
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:38.820]   Let's pray.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.820]   Maybe take a moment.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:55.660]   If you're comfortable, I just invite you to open your hands before the Lord.
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.740]   If you know this message has been speaking to you, everybody's eyes is closed.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:07.700]   But you know in this moment, the Holy Spirit has been speaking directly to you.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.940]   It almost feels like my experience has been your experience.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.300]   Maybe slightly different in your context, but you know what I'm saying resonates with
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.300]   you.
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:22.020]   As you open your hands before the Lord, it's a symbol before Him to say, "Maranatha.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.020]   Come Lord Jesus."
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:30.020]   If you're in this room right now or you're watching online, and you know that your heart
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:37.180]   is not right, you know that you've been consumed in doing over being, you know that for a while
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:43.820]   you've just been kind of acting a Christian, going through the motions, trying to live
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:52.460]   the right morals, but there's no active, vibrant, intimate relationship with God.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:58.180]   I believe the Holy Spirit has a special touch of His presence for you this morning.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:06.780]   On this Pentecost Sunday, He's here for you.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:12.460]   Moses cries out, "If only God is with us."
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.740]   And some of you in this room, you need to say that again.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.460]   You haven't said it for a while.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.460]   You've gotten ahead of God, you've gotten ahead of His timing, you're consumed with
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:32.820]   activity, even good activity, but it's actually shielding you from slowing down enough to
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:37.100]   rebirth your relationship with Jesus.
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.140]   And that's what today is about.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:43.780]   And so those in this room that need that, I want to just invite you just to bring that
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:47.660]   before the Holy Spirit as He leads in your heart.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.820]   We're going to create some space now just for that to take place.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.300]   We've got a few minutes left in the service.
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.660]   Don't need to rush, just take a moment.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.500]   It's quite rare in Hong Kong to have a time where things slow down a little bit.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:03.020]   Take this time, take this moment to let the Holy Spirit search your heart, to encourage
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:06.540]   you, love you, bring His compassion to you.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:12.180]   And as He shows you stuff to bring before Him, do that in faith and just say, "Maranatha,"
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:16.100]   to Him in your heart.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:24.140]   I believe that the Lord is uncovering a strategy of the enemy over our lives, over our church
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.140]   today.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:32.180]   The only way we break off that strategy is we turn to Jesus, individually and corporately
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.100]   together.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.700]   So I invite you to take the time to do that now.
