00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,000
 Amen. Church, would you have a seat? Thank you, worship team.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And today we kick off our long-awaited,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [BREATHING]

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 [BREATHING]

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,440
 I remember when I first heard about the Exodus. I was maybe like six or seven, sitting in

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,600
 some Sunday school classroom, hearing about a God who does miracles. The parting of seas,

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,600
 the dropping of food from heaven, the turning rivers into blood. I mean, it was the stuff

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,740
 of legend and fairy tale, and my imagination just soared. So I kind of grew up believing

9
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,120
 that when God delivers His people, He does so by stepping into moments of human history

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,720
 in earth-shattering ways, that He steps into the worst moments of human suffering to change

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,120
 it in an instant. Well, I've come to learn, of course, that actually the greatest miracles

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,360
 God does is not the parting of the seas, the dropping of the food, the turning rivers red.

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,860
 The greatest miracles that God does are the small, almost imperceptible changes that happen

14
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,520
 inside of us. The things that on the surface appear almost inconsequential or meaningless,

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,120
 but when seen all together, create a story that actually is even greater than we could

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,120
 ever have first imagined.

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:58,220
 [Music]

18
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,240
 The Exodus story, as revealed to us in Scripture, tells us that when it comes to God delivering

19
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,040
 His people out of their slavery and bondage and bringing them into freedom, it's not actually

20
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,240
 in those breathtaking moments that God does the deliverance, it's actually in the journey

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,120
 itself. In fact, it's in the journey, in all of its highs and its beauty, as well as its

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,880
 struggles and trials and hardship, that actually the deliverance itself occurs. And this tells

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,360
 us something very interesting about the Exodus narrative, that if it teaches us anything,

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,920
 it teaches us this, that God indeed is in the business of delivering His people. That

25
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,960
 deliverance, however, may come in a form that we never first would have expected.

26
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:50,960
 [Music]

27
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,040
 In this series, I want to invite us on a journey of deliverance together, as we trace the historical

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,340
 and spiritual footsteps of Israel as they journey from their slavery to their newfound

29
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,960
 freedom in the Promised Land, some 400 miles away.

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:15,960
 [Music]

31
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,840
 It's a journey with many twists and turns, a journey of both joy and sorrow, of great

32
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,320
 hope and painful tragedy. It's a journey that will take us from these crowded streets of

33
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,760
 Cairo to the sacred tombs of Minya, to the shores of the River Nile, to the wide expanse

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,320
 of Sinai Desert, to mountain peaks of stunning beauty, to valleys barren and endless. It's

35
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,840
 a journey that will take us across the breadth of Egypt, right up through the land of Jordan,

36
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,720
 eventually into the heartland of Israel itself.

37
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,640
 And it's a journey that starts with you. You see, we all have a story of oppression. We

38
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,400
 all long to be free from the things that enslave us. So could it be that this ancient story

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,440
 of tragedy, slavery, and oppression, and ultimately freedom and hope and love, is actually far

40
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,920
 more about you and your story than you ever realize? Our God is a God who longs to bring

41
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:23,800
 people out of slavery into freedom. He's a God of hope and goodness and promise. He's

42
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,720
 the God, in other words, of the one thing you need most, Exodus.

43
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,720
 [Music]

44
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:47,040
 Ah, there we go. So, there is nothing more powerful than truly being free. And we had

45
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,880
 originally planned to bring this series to you in the fall of 2020, and then this little

46
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,280
 thing called COVID got in the way. And I've always long thought that God has a wicked,

47
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:04,520
 ironic sense of humor, because a series that is designed to teach us about the joys of

48
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:12,240
 freedom got delayed by a virus that strongly restricted our freedoms. Perhaps we are now

49
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,680
 in a much better place today than we were, say, three years ago, to really begin to reflect

50
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,240
 about what it is like to be moving from a place of restriction to a place of freedom.

51
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,120
 I mean, I think it would be wrong to grossly say that we've been in slavery in the last

52
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,360
 couple of years, but I think it would be right to say that all of us have desired a greater

53
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,320
 sense of personal freedom in our lives than perhaps ever before. In many ways, I think

54
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:47,640
 in the last four years or so, we've experienced maybe a microcosm of what the Exodus narrative

55
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:54,840
 is all about. We've all experienced what it's like to live under painful restrictions. We've

56
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,880
 all experienced how those restrictions have changed our identity, the way we think and

57
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,680
 the way that we feel. We've all experienced in the last few years, a longing and a desire

58
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,400
 for a change in the future. We've all realized that we don't have the ability to make that

59
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,720
 change ourselves. We all have been in need of something outside of ourselves to bring

60
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,480
 that change. We've all experienced that when we begun to see a glimmer of hope that there

61
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,960
 is a change coming, we felt that hope rise up inside of us. We've all found ourselves

62
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,320
 taking those tentative first steps into the new freedom, not sure whether that freedom

63
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,120
 is going to last and then get stuffed back into lockdown once again. We've all experienced,

64
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:47,760
 haven't we, walking into freedom again and finding ourselves in the joy of what that

65
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,640
 freedom has brought us and yet still carrying the baggage of the trauma of the years that

66
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,000
 have gone. In many ways, our journey in the last couple of years has very much been the

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,240
 journey that Israel went through in the book of Exodus. And one thing we learned from the

68
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,080
 book of Exodus, perhaps more than any other, is that God's timing is perfect. And so I

69
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,280
 think delivering the series now is the right time that God wants us to go on this journey

70
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:23,280
 together. Now, as much as COVID, I think has created us a new perspective for understanding

71
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,120
 the book of Exodus like never before. Today, I want to invite you actually to a much deeper

72
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,440
 level of a journey in Exodus that perhaps you might've thought of before. You see, the

73
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:43,040
 book of Exodus at its very core is essentially an invitation into two of humanity's greatest

74
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:51,080
 journeys. And that is the journey of discovering who is the creator of the universe and the

75
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,080
 journey of discovering who we are in response to that. I want to say that again, the journey

76
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,360
 that Exodus really invites us into is a journey of understanding who really sits at the center

77
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:10,480
 of the universe and then understanding who we are in response to that person. And really

78
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,200
 what the book of Exodus does right at the beginning of the biblical narrative coming

79
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,160
 right as it does after Genesis is invite us to ask some of the biggest questions of our

80
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:30,120
 shared human experience. Questions like, is there really a God? And if there is a God,

81
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,960
 does he care about our experience, our life, our suffering? And if this God does care about

82
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:44,760
 our suffering, then will he come to deliver us from that suffering? And if he does come

83
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,520
 and deliver us from our suffering, what is it that we learn about this God in the process

84
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,680
 of that deliverance? And not only what do we learn about him, but once we are finding

85
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,080
 ourselves in new freedom by his deliverance, then how do we come to understand how we live

86
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,760
 now in relation to him and importantly, in relation to one another? Those are the central

87
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,200
 questions of Exodus. And because of that, when we look at the book of Exodus, we're

88
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,160
 not just studying a book that helps us to understand something about God in the old

89
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,440
 Testament. What we're really looking at is a book that helps us to understand who God

90
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,440
 is in general. And therefore we're looking at a book that really helps us to understand

91
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,280
 the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. When you think about the journey of Exodus

92
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,720
 and you think about those questions behind me on the screen right now, you can understand

93
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,760
 why this book begins to point towards Jesus Christ. And you can begin to understand why

94
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:44,480
 Jesus Christ in his ministry uses so much of the imagery of Exodus. His baptism, going

95
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,280
 into the desert for 40 days to be tempted by the enemy. The way he teaches his disciples

96
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,720
 to pray, which is essentially a prayer that takes them through the journey of Exodus.

97
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,720
 How he invokes the imagery of the Exodus on the cross and in his resurrection. How the

98
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,360
 early church captured all of that in the communion time, the breaking of bread, the giving of

99
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,520
 that, the sharing in the wine, how all of that began to speak to the early church about

100
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,120
 the power of God who brings us through Exodus. The Exodus is not just a book in the old

101
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:22,520
 Testament. It is a blueprint for understanding the work of God in the world today. And this

102
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:30,000
 is the beauty of it, the power of it, the profundity of this book. And the book is shaped

103
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,760
 around two essential processes. Those are the process of going into freedom communally

104
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,480
 and individually. If Exodus is about anything, it's about a communal journey of a nation

105
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:53,880
 discovering freedom from oppression, discovering hope out of slavery. God comes to a nation.

106
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:00,160
 He is turning compassion for a nation. He raises up people to lead a nation. He draws

107
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,600
 that nation through the most miraculous, powerful things that he has done, perhaps in all the

108
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,520
 scripture. And he does it because he wants the nation to be shaped by those shared experiences.

109
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,840
 So Israel together experiences the parting of the sea. Israel together experiences the

110
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,480
 pillar of cloud on Mount Sinai. Israel together hears the law being given on the stone tablets.

111
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,220
 Israel together sees what it's like to walk into the promised land and receive the long

112
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,160
 held promise that God had for them. God does it in a nation because there's something powerful

113
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:40,760
 about a community of people experiencing God together. But it's not just communal. Importantly,

114
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:48,040
 the Exodus is also personal and individual. As we'll see next week, it all begins in the

115
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:55,800
 calling of four women, individual women who have the courage to stand up against an empire

116
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:02,840
 and say enough is enough. It then focuses on an individual man, Moses, a man who's deeply

117
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,840
 broken, a man who's shamed of his past, a man who needs Exodus himself and how he feels

118
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,240
 about the darkness that sits in him. And then a man who is then used to lead a nation to

119
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,760
 freedom. And then throughout the journey, there are people like Hur and Aaron, Jethro

120
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,120
 and others that come to the fore. God uses individuals to also lead them on a journey

121
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,680
 of salvation. And over the next 25 weeks, this is what we're going to do. And I want

122
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,760
 to encourage you to set both a communal and an individual expectation. I believe that

123
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,320
 God's going to do something powerful amongst us over these 25 weeks communally together.

124
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,280
 I want to invite you to be here every single week as we journey through this together,

125
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,280
 because I believe God's going to reshape something in our culture, reshape something in who we

126
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,840
 are. If God has come and done that for a nation in the past, can he not come and do that in

127
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,760
 Hong Kong and China today? If God has come and shaped and changed the culture of a people

128
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,160
 before, can he not come and shape the change the culture of a people now? It's something

129
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:10,800
 that he longs to do together. But if your expectations are only communal, then I think

130
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,760
 you're actually going to miss out a lot of what this is all about. Because at the very

131
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,920
 heart of it, Exodus is for you. There is a journey of Exodus that God is calling you

132
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:31,920
 on. He's calling me on. There is a movement, a need for a movement away from the brokenness

133
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:39,160
 that is in me towards more freedom in Christ Jesus. And if you come here expecting to look

134
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,720
 at some visually engaging films and be entertained and learn something about the Exodus, you're

135
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,880
 actually going to miss out on the whole point of this, which is for your Exodus.

136
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,080
 This whole series was birthed five years ago. And as so many things are in my life, it was

137
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,120
 birthed whilst I was walking and praying. And I saw a picture, and I was praying for

138
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,720
 us as a church five years ago, and I saw a picture of a crowd of people worshipping.

139
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,480
 And in this crowd of people worshipping, their hands were all lifted in the air. It's a beautiful

140
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,440
 picture. But as I looked closely, I could see that there were shackles around the wrists

141
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,480
 of everybody, and there was a chain between their hands. They weren't chained together.

142
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,320
 They're all individual. But each of the hands that were in the air had shackles around them

143
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,200
 and chain between them. And I felt like God was communicating that this group of people

144
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:39,600
 were worshipping and had a desire in them to live the life that Christ had always called

145
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:47,320
 them to live, a desire in them to be Christian, to live Jesus in the world, and a loving desire

146
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,400
 to worship Him. And yet something was weighing them down. Something was holding them back.

147
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,640
 They weren't truly free to worship Him. And these chains were heavy. And as I looked at

148
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,240
 this picture over time, I could see people's hands. They're trying desperately to keep

149
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,480
 them in the air, but the chains were wearing them down. And as I look closely in the chains,

150
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,640
 they were not new chains. They were brown, tinted, rusty. These were old chains, chains

151
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,640
 that had been hanging around for a long period of time. And I noticed that the chains, the

152
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,960
 links in the chains between the two hands of the people that were worshipping, weren't

153
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:33,240
 like normal links, but they were words. Some of them were names of people. Some of them

154
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,760
 were just specifically sins. Some of them were emotions. Some of them were places, the

155
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,840
 names of cities and places. Some of them were events that have happened. And I could see

156
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,600
 that what was weighing people down was these individual things, maybe one thing that they

157
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,160
 had not been able to shake, despite how desiring they were to worship. They had been carrying

158
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,040
 this thing around and around with them. And I realized that God was speaking to me about

159
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,120
 my own habitual sin, about those one or two sins that over 40 years of my life, I've struggled

160
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,000
 to shake, how I have seasons of victory. And yet I find myself then falling back into that

161
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,080
 sin once again, and knowing that I'm not really truly free. But I know that the picture wasn't

162
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:27,600
 just for me. I think the picture was for you. I think the picture was for everybody here.

163
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,840
 Because each one of us, I believe, have a desire to worship, and yet we all have things

164
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:41,080
 that weigh us down. We all have sin that we struggle with, sin that we struggle to shake.

165
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,880
 We all have experiences that have hurt us in the past that we carry around with us like

166
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:52,080
 baggage. We all have emotions that have run deep in us, and that kind of have this tendency

167
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,440
 to come up in us and hold us back. There is stuff that each one of us carry. And if that

168
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:04,800
 resonates with you, then this series is for you. God had you on His heart five years ago,

169
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,360
 and He was desiring for you to truly be free. Because what you need to understand when you

170
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,920
 read the book of Exodus, and when we teach a series like this, is that when we open the

171
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,400
 book of Exodus, we're not opening a story about something that God has done in the past

172
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,880
 for one group of people, written down for all eternity, so we can read something about

173
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,600
 what He did then. What we're actually reading is God's personality, His character, who He

174
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,520
 is, determining it for all people at all time, and saying, "What I did for this group of

175
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,400
 people, I will continue to do, because I'm the same yesterday, today, and forever."

176
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,160
 In other words, what we have is not a God who's the God of the Exodus of the past, we

177
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,840
 have a God who's the God of the Exodus today. Your Exodus, my Exodus, the thing that I need

178
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,320
 to break the chains that hold me back in my worship, a God who steps in and does what

179
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:04,520
 only He can do. There is no sin that Jesus Christ cannot help you to overcome. I'm going

180
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,920
 to say that again. There is no sin that Jesus Christ cannot help you to overcome. There

181
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:18,920
 is no slavery more powerful than the name of Jesus. There is no Pharaoh that God cannot

182
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,920
 bring to His knees. There is no empire that God cannot overcome. There are no seas that

183
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:30,600
 God cannot part. There are no mountains that God cannot shake. There are no deserts that

184
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,600
 God cannot provide for. There are no promised lands that God cannot stop you from entering.

185
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:46,120
 That's our God. We have a God of the Exodus. You have not come here to watch some visually

186
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,320
 engaging films and to be entertained for 25 weeks and learn something about the biblical

187
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,920
 book of Exodus. You've come here for biblical Exodus yourself.

188
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:03,920
 All right. I love the golf clap. It's beautiful. It's like he got a bogey. It should have been

189
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:10,640
 a par, but he got a bogey. Thanks, man. That was a birdie, wasn't it? You can tell he got

190
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:19,240
 a golfer in the second row. I love you guys. All right. I want to show you God's heart

191
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:25,520
 for you because God comes to the Israelites right at the beginning of the story. He says,

192
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,840
 "I want you to know what I'm about to do." As we start this series, I feel in my spirit

193
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,640
 this is what God wants to communicate to you. It's Him saying, "This is what I want to do

194
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,340
 in you. This is what I'm about to do in you." In Exodus chapter 6, the context is God has

195
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,640
 called Moses crazy, burning bush moment. A lot of stuff's happened. God comes in this

196
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,040
 moment and Moses is now back in Egypt. He's already spoken to Pharaoh a couple of times.

197
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,080
 Pharaoh's rejected him. God is reiterating to him time and time again what he's about

198
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,720
 to do. In this moment, Moses says to the Israelites through God what God is going to do in their

199
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,760
 Exodus. I want to read this to you from verse 6. "Therefore say to the Israelites, 'I am

200
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,480
 the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you

201
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,640
 from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty

202
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,480
 acts of judgment. I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will

203
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,160
 know that I am the Lord God who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians,

204
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,600
 and I will bring you to the land that I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to

205
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:39,800
 Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it to you as a possession, for I am the Lord.'"

206
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,960
 God says here, and He does this in a number of places, but I think it's more beautifully

207
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,500
 put here. He says five things. I'm going to do five things. These are the five critical

208
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,360
 movements of Exodus. These are the five critical movements that the whole book of Exodus is

209
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,040
 shaped on. These are the five movements that I'm going to preach through as we go through

210
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,480
 this series, and these are the five things that will always be at work in your freedom

211
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:11,400
 from sin. And here they are. The first one is this. God acknowledges their slavery. "I

212
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:18,720
 will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians." He knew they were in slavery.

213
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,240
 The second thing is He gives them a promise. He says, "I will free you from being slaves

214
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,700
 to them." There's a promise. This is what I will do for you. I will free you from being

215
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,640
 slaves to them. He then tells them about the process of His liberation. He says, "I will

216
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,280
 redeem you with an outstretched arm which always spoke about miracles and power, and

217
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,200
 with mighty acts of judgment." That's how He's going to liberate them. He then speaks

218
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,640
 about the reason why, because He wants to shape a new identity in them. He says, "I

219
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,680
 will take you as my own people, and I will be your God." And then He tells them the result.

220
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,680
 He says, "I will bring you to the land that I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham,

221
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:06,360
 Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession, for I am the Lord." Five things.

222
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:17,120
 Slavery, promise, liberation, identity, home. Those are your five steps to freedom. It starts

223
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,080
 with you saying, "I know that there is some slavery in me, and I've been carrying it around

224
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,560
 for a long time. There are chains at times between my lifted hands and worship." It's

225
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,280
 then believing the promise that God has given, that in the life, death, and resurrection

226
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,000
 of Jesus, your sins have been paid for, and the price has been paid, and in the blood

227
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,280
 of Christ, you have been set free. Then it comes in trusting the journey of liberation

228
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,880
 that He leads us on through the power of His Word and the work of His Spirit in our lives.

229
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,360
 And then it comes in receiving the new identity that we have in Christ Jesus. For anyone who

230
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,120
 is in Christ Jesus is a new creation. The old is gone, the new has come. And as we walk

231
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,040
 in the new identity that we've been given in Him, we know then that we don't fall back

232
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,760
 into the old habits, but we find ourselves liberated into the new. And as we walk into

233
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,360
 the new, we are those new people who carry the hope of Christ to the world, inviting

234
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,440
 people out there into a new home themselves, into an experience of relationship with Jesus.

235
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:29,080
 And in this process of slavery, promise, liberation, identity, and home, we journey from our sin,

236
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:36,320
 into greater freedom to worship Him. And that's the powerful thing in all of this, that this

237
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:43,160
 movement, that this journey is to lead us towards something new. See, the Exodus narrative

238
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:50,480
 is about disruption. It's about being subversive in order to create something in order that

239
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,640
 might settle. I want you to see the journey here. There is disruption from our sin, disruption

240
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:04,520
 from our slavery, subversion of oppression and empire, so that God can create a new nation,

241
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,200
 a new identity in His people, a new people that would go forward carrying His character

242
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,840
 in the world, so He could settle them in a home where they could worship Him without

243
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:23,960
 rest. And this is the really important thing. You see, Exodus is not actually about freedom.

244
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,760
 Really important you hear this, church. Exodus is not actually about freedom. Exodus is about

245
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,000
 intimacy. Because what God says in chapter three of the book of Exodus, He says, "I want

246
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,200
 to liberate my people." Why? "So they might worship Me." So they may not have the chains

247
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,120
 between their hands anymore. See, the beauty of Exodus is that there is a drawing out to

248
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,840
 draw in. God is not just liberating us from our sin so that we can experience some great

249
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,320
 freedom and then in our freedom fall back into slavery again. Paul would write to the

250
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:06,800
 church, he would say, "You are free, now be free." See, we are taken out of slavery so

251
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,680
 that we are then taken into something. What is it that we're taking into? We're taken

252
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:18,440
 into greater depth of intimacy with Jesus Christ. You are free in order to worship.

253
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,040
 You are free in order to find intimacy with Him. And this drawing out to drawing in is

254
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:29,080
 a metaphor throughout the whole book of Exodus. Moses is drawn out of the weeds, out of the

255
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,680
 reeds of the river, now taken into Pharaoh's home. Israel are drawn out of their slavery

256
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,120
 into the desert, because the desert was to refine them before they got into their home.

257
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,360
 And the same will be for you. God through His power is drawing you out of sin, not just

258
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:51,240
 so that you can enjoy freedom, but in your freedom, truly be free. To worship, to be

259
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,360
 in intimacy, to walk with Him, to experience life and love like it has never been before.

260
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,800
 That's what Exodus is all about. And so there are these two metaphors that run throughout

261
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,240
 the whole thing. The first I've already mentioned to you, it's the individual and communal.

262
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,320
 The individual journey to the communal. When you become Christian, you are not just saved

263
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,360
 out of your sin, you are saved out of your sin into the body of Christ. So in other words,

264
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,520
 you are individually saved. Christ comes and redeems and renews your brokenness and your

265
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,920
 sin, your sin that put Jesus on the cross. You're free and liberated from that sin through

266
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,760
 relationship and forgiveness and repentance in Christ Jesus. It's a beautiful thing. But

267
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,720
 then you're put into a new family, a new community, the body of Christ. And when we come to see

268
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,240
 this, when we see what happens in the Exodus story, where they're taken out of Egypt and

269
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,320
 put into their own land, as they individually experience their intimacy with Christ, they

270
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,760
 then come into intimacy with one another as a new nation. This drawing out to draw in

271
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,360
 together is a big part of what Exodus is all about. This is why we talk about community

272
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,760
 all the time here at the Vine. It's not just something that we kind of want you to do.

273
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,640
 It's what you've been saved for. You've been saved to be in intimate relationship with

274
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,040
 the people that you're sitting around right now. And you can't know everybody in this

275
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,320
 church personally and intimately, but you should know some of them because the church

276
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,480
 is not 90 minutes on a Sunday, it's the people of God. You've been saved out of your sin

277
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,640
 into the body of Christ. And my prayer for you through this series is that you would

278
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,240
 feel the encouragement and the love of a growing community around you. It's a little bit like

279
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,280
 all of these little mosaic tiles that I'm holding in my hand here, which you probably

280
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,080
 won't be able to see very well because they're really, really, really small, but I'm going

281
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,480
 to hold one up right here. I got all these tiles from a little shop in Amman, the capital

282
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,080
 of Jordan, just some two and a half hour drive away from the desert where Israel wandered

283
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,000
 for 40 years. And as you came in today, perhaps, especially if you're sitting here in the lower

284
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,160
 house, you may have received one of these little mosaic tiles and you're probably wondering

285
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:06,400
 why was I given a little Lego piece. It's not a Lego piece. It's a little mosaic tile.

286
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,560
 Let me tell you about why this is important. Because in many ways, the Exodus is like this

287
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,840
 journey where we go from being this one little thing, this one little person who's carrying

288
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,440
 all of the things that they carry, and we experience a liberation from God, which doesn't

289
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,440
 keep us alone, but that liberation brings us together with others. And the powerful

290
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,280
 thing about these little mosaic tiles is, of course, on their own, they're just like

291
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,040
 this little, small, little thing. But when you put it next to lots of other little, small

292
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,760
 things, the shop where I brought this from, they make these incredible mosaic art pieces,

293
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,640
 the most incredible things you've ever seen, all made up of thousands, literally thousands

294
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:52,080
 of little, little pieces of tile, just like this one. And as you came in, you were given

295
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,120
 one, and it represents so much who you are, but it actually represents a much bigger story

296
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:04,840
 that you're swept up in, a story where your little tile, if it's held back, keeps the

297
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:12,240
 mosaic from being completed. But when your little tile is placed in to the mosaic that

298
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,640
 God is creating here at the vine, that mosaic takes on a picture and an image that it had

299
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,680
 never experienced before. That's a drawing out to draw in.

300
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,720
 The other thing that is the metaphor that runs through the whole of the Exodus story

301
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,160
 is the metaphor of new creation. In fact, much of the language of Exodus is mirroring,

302
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:39,040
 echoing the language from Genesis 1 and 2, the language of creation. And the Hebrew in

303
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:45,440
 Exodus links back to that first moment in Genesis, where when God moves and He acts,

304
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,200
 it's like He's deciding to start again. He's deciding to step into, like He did in Genesis

305
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,040
 1 and 2, where He stepped into darkness. And out of that formlessness of darkness, He brought

306
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,880
 light. He shaped and formed and created something. So God in the Exodus steps into a new darkness,

307
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,360
 the darkness of sin, the darkness of slavery, the darkness of oppression. And He steps in

308
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,280
 with a light of hope and the light of compassion and the light of new life. And He moves His

309
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,600
 people from their darkness of slavery into a new light. And light becomes this main theme

310
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,400
 throughout the book. God first appears to Moses in a burning bush, the light of that

311
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,920
 bush drawing him towards it. God appears before the whole of Israel in a burning cloud of

312
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,760
 fire on Mount Sinai. He then becomes a pillar of fire that leads them through the desert

313
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,140
 day in and day out. He then becomes this power of fire that's met in the tabernacle across

314
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,920
 the Ark of the Covenant as they erect the tabernacle when they stop on that journey.

315
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,160
 And light becomes this idea that God is at work, present with His people, moving them

316
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,520
 from their slavery into something better, from darkness into light. And that's the journey

317
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:07,440
 He's bringing you on as well. The word Exodus is a Latin word that derives from a Greek

318
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:17,600
 word which is exodus with an O at the end. And exodus means this, a departure. I think

319
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:24,680
 that's such a beautifully profound thought. Because what we're doing today is we're drawing

320
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:31,640
 a line in the sand and we're saying today is the day of our departure. See, no journey

321
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,480
 to freedom begins unless you take that first step. I love that moment in the Lord of the

322
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,560
 Rings where Samwise and Frodo are moving out finally after being given the mission by Gandalf.

323
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,600
 And there's that moment where Samwise stops Frodo and Frodo's like, "What are you doing?"

324
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,040
 And he's like, "I've never been this far away from home than right now." And he takes that

325
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,840
 next step towards his adventure, a departure. See, your exodus begins when you're willing

326
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,400
 to make a departure, when you're willing to say, "I'm tired of the darkness," when you're

327
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:10,720
 willing to say, "I'm so over this thing that continues to hold me back," when you're willing

328
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,720
 to say, "I admit that there's a habitual sin in my life that I can't seem to break," when

329
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,240
 you're willing to say, "I can't fix this myself, but I need God to come and do something that

330
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,440
 only He can do," when you're willing to say, "This is not actually always about me. This

331
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,160
 is about my family. It's about the people around me. It's about my community. It's about

332
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:41,560
 me becoming a better version of myself for them. It's about you saying, 'This is my moment

333
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,520
 where I can move into a greater sense of freedom than I have ever felt before.'"

334
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:55,040
 So as we start this series on exodus, here's my key question to you. What is it that you

335
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:07,000
 need exodus from? What is it that you need to depart from? What is your exodus? That's

336
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 the question. That's the question that has driven this whole series for me. It's the

337
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,540
 reason why we've taken four years to pull this together. It's the reason why our church

338
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:21,120
 has invested the money that it has into this series. It's the reason why we're taking 25

339
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,680
 weeks to walk through this series together. It's the reason why I'm going to get up here

340
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,560
 and preach my heart out to you as much as I can week in, week out, is because I believe

341
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:35,120
 this is your moment. I believe that that picture of us with chains between our hands as we

342
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,840
 worship will not be the picture of this church moving forward. I believe in your freedom.

343
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:51,240
 I believe in your release, but it will require a departure. You need to choose to move from

344
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:58,960
 darkness to light. To help you to reflect a little bit more about this journey from

345
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,800
 darkness to light, as well as all the teaching films that we've created for this series,

346
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,560
 and a number of times, critical times throughout the series, we've also created some creative

347
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,040
 videos. These videos are not so much about teaching, but more about an experience. One

348
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,000
 of these videos, the one we're about to watch now, is a poem that we wrote as a team that

349
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,520
 put this together. We wrote this poem to help us to understand the profundity of what it

350
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,280
 is to be trapped in darkness, and yet the beauty that there is in a God who steps forward

351
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,240
 to bring light. As we watch this creative film now, I want to pray that you would do

352
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,580
 so in a prayerful spirit, asking that God would come and speak to you about what your

353
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,840
 departure is today. Then after that, I'll come and pray for us. Let's watch this.

354
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:57,120
 It begins in the emptiness of nothingness, where darkness has extinguished even the memory

355
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:04,440
 of light, where nothingness and emptiness tear space into fragments and everything is

356
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:13,240
 nothing at all. It starts here, where fear shackles and failure persists, where slavery

357
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:21,240
 binds and oppression resists. It starts here, in the place you least expect, suddenly a

358
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:28,640
 light, dancing to be noticed within the empire of darkness, crackling with beginnings, restless

359
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,560
 with life, as if the emptiness had simply been waking for divine direction. It starts

360
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:42,720
 here. Shadows now play against the walls of death, movement and memory and miracles and

361
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,680
 might breaking into nothingness with the heresy of possibility, shaming the darkness with

362
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:57,320
 the creation of hope. It starts here. A drawing out, a calling forth, a voice in the wilderness,

363
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,840
 a wilderness of voices, whispers of freedom, bushes on fire, a journey beyond, ascending

364
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:10,600
 to glory. It starts here, in the emptiness of nothingness, in the slavery and oppression,

365
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:17,600
 in the fear and the failure and the pharaohs in us all. May you see what heaven is stirring.

366
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:23,840
 For a light has come and a light is coming, death now dead, bushes now burning. Yes, a

367
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,640
 light has come and a light is coming, death now dead, bushes now burning.
