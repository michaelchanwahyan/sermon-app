[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Amen, thank you Tim and happy Lunar New Year everyone and thank you for having me
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   And I hope you are all enjoying the food, the festive decoration everywhere in Hong Kong
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   and family time as well
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And at least you may enjoy the purple colour day I think
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   So, in case you are not familiar with the culture of Lunar New Year
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Hong Kong basically is a big family thing
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   We go out to visit our families and friends
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   We gather and some of my friends would go to Mainland to visit their extended family as well
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   So basically, Lunar New Year in Hong Kong is a huge family festival for us
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   So, for my family, the Yu's family, our tradition is quite relatively simple
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   We do not have many different dinners going on
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   We just have one, like happening on the second day of the New Year, which is today
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And every year we gather on the second year of the New Year
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And as a kid I really enjoyed it
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   When I was young, my mum always prepared new clothes, new shoes for me
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And then I would go over to my grandparents' house in the afternoon
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And then the adults would be playing mahjong, which they don't have much attention on us
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   So for us as kids, it's perfect for snacks and chocolate
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   So I really enjoyed it
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And then my grandma would be cooking a big meal for everyone
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So my dad has four siblings, so it's not many, many
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   But if everyone is present, we still get up to 20 people for the dinner
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   So my grandma always cooked for every one of us
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Of course, the licey part is the best part for kids
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   So it was a very happy experience for me as a kid
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   But since I started to grow up, I want to show you a meme
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And perhaps it's universal for family gatherings
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Your relative will start asking you questions you might not be super comfortable to answer
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Like, what school are you in? How's your academic results in school?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Who is taller among me and my cousins?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And when I grow up, they will ask me, how much do you earn a month?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And I'm like, I'm not sure if I want to share that out loud in front of everyone
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So that's the part that I don't fully enjoy as I'm starting to become a teenager, I guess
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And the other thing is, you know, Lunar New Year for us is always happy gatherings
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Families, and we all want happy gatherings
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And there's a saying, you know, Lunar New Year has a lot of rules
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Like, you can't shower or wash your hair on the first day
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And I want to show you one rule that my mom always tells me
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Do not argue with people during CNY
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Because that will give you a whole year of turbulent relationships
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So you can't really have conflicts during the Lunar New Year
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   But the tension still goes on, right?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   So as a teenager, when I sit at a table, I start to pick up a little bit of people's facial expressions
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   They might not like each other, or some people will avoid sitting together
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   You can tell every year they're doing that
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You know what I mean, right?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So today I will read into the family dynamics with you guys
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   We all want our family to be peaceful, drama-free, and we get to enjoy each other, right?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   But many of the time, it's not the case
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So if we cannot be excused from this complex situation
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   How do we see God's goodness in the midst of all the tension that's going on around us?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So actually, the Bible does not shy away from telling us the family dramas
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And we are going to look at Abraham's family today
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   So we all know Abraham, who is one of the most important figures in the Bible, right?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   He's called to be the father of many nations and a blessing to all nations
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And he's also our father in faith as well
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So as Paul said, everyone who is in faith are descendants of Abraham
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So he is important to us
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   But I think many of us know Abraham's story
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So God has a covenant with Abraham that he will bless him with many descendants
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And they will live in a promised land for many, many generations
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And we all know the rest of the story
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   God gave Isaac to Abraham and his wife Sarah
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And then we have a covenant to Isaac and also Jacob and so on
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   As we can tell from Exodus, we see that they are really having many descendants as God promised
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   However, Abraham and his wife Sarah were childless when God gave them the promise
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And he was around 75 years old at that time, which is quite old already
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And they only had Isaac when Abraham was 100
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So there was a 25 years gap that, oh, we don't have a son
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So how would God's promise come true if I don't have a son?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   So I think that period of time might have been giving them a lot of stress
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Especially Sarah as a woman in those days
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   They are quite stressful because she's childless
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   There's a lot of shame, maybe stress going on in her life
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   So she came up with a plan and she decided to give her slave called Hagar to Abraham
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And then they have a child together
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   So that's what happened
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   They have Ishmael
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   But, however, 13 years later, God spoke to Abraham again
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   He said, only the child from you and Sarah will be the promised son
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Oops, so what do we do with the son?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   But back in those days, not bad to have more children
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   So we will pick up from the story here
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   We will look at Genesis chapter 21 and see how the matter turns out
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So, Genesis chapter 21, verse 8
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   The child, who is Isaac, grew and was weaned
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   But Sarah saw the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   So she said to Abraham, cast out this slave woman with her son
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   For the son of this slave woman shall not inherit a lot along with my son Isaac
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   The matter was very distressing to Abraham on account of his son
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   So we see here, there is a huge conflict going on in this chosen family because of the sons
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And we can tell that Sarah doesn't seem to be happy with the other son, Ishmael
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And when he was playing with her own son Isaac
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   We are not sure what exactly Ishmael did here
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   But we saw that Sarah seemed to see that son as a threat to her and her son
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And she wanted Abraham to send Hagar and Ishmael away
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   So when we read this, we might wonder
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Isn't that your suggestion for Abraham and Hagar to have a son together?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Why are you doing this?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Of course, Sarah's brokenness and her security plays a role here in the story
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   However, when we look deeper into the story
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   We see that there is something more going on within the dynamic of this family
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So when we look back a little bit in chapter 16
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   When Hagar was conceived, the Bible said
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   He went into Hagar and she conceived
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And when she saw that she had conceived
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   She looked with contempt on her mistress
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   So when we look at here, we can tell
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Maybe she is not fully innocent in this family
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Maybe she had done something to trigger a little bit of the tension in the whole family as well
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And for Abraham, if we pay attention to his words and his responses in the whole story
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   We can see that he actually holds a little bit of a passive role in the whole family
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   So when Sarah made a suggestion, he agreed and did that
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   And when Sarah complains about Hagar, looked with contempt on her
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And he told Sarah, "It's your slave, you can do whatever you want with her"
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And now when Sarah asks for expelling Hagar and Ishmael
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   His reaction was very distressed
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   So we see that even though Abraham is very blessed
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   He is the chosen one by God
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   But he is not free from the family dramas and conflicts
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And he can mess things up too, just like you and me
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   In this family, Sarah and Abraham might play a bigger role
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   But we see that everyone in this family contributed to the dynamic and conflict
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I think by looking into this story, one thing I do want to note that
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   There is no perfect family
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   All families experience conflicts and somehow a level of dysfunction
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Because as Romans said, we are all sinned and fall short of the grace from God
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   So I think that's one thing I want to acknowledge together
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   That we are all living in somehow imperfect family as well
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Just not to discourage you, but let's acknowledge that we do mess things up
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And we all have a role in our family
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And we are significant in that way by the way how we behave
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Or what we say with our family members
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So no matter what role you are in
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Some of you may be taking a little bit more role as parents or as older siblings
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Or you have more responsibilities than others
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Some of you may feel that I have not much to say within my family's matters
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Maybe me as a kid younger, I can't really say anything about my family
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   But I want to encourage you that you are all important to your own family
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Everything you do is contributing in your family
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And also as we are called to be the children of God
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I wonder how does it contribute to us in our family as well
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Of course our brokenness, our insecurity like Sarah may contribute to our family
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   But the good things like as children of God
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Our faith, our love, our life that flow out from Jesus
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Has an impact in our family as well
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   So what does it mean to have God in our family?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And how do we involve God in our family as well?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   So let's take a look how God was involved in Abraham's family
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Perhaps it will give us some insights and direction
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   So let's pick up from chapter 21, verse 12
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   But God said to Abraham, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and because of your slave woman
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   For it is through Isaac that offspring shall be named for you
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   As for the son of the slave woman, I will make a nation of him also
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Because he is your offspring
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And gave them to Hagar
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   She went on her way and wandered in the desert of Beersheba
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   So God spoke to Abraham
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   The first thing when we pay attention is addressing his emotion
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   He saw that Abraham is very distressed
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And he also saw the reason behind it
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Abraham as the father of both sons, Ishmael and Isaac
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   It must be very difficult for him to face that situation
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Because both of them are his sons
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And he loves them and has a responsibility with them as well
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   But at the same time, Sarah is his wife whom he loved
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And also he has spent most of his life with Sarah as well
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   So now he has to make a decision kind of between his sons and also his wife
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   So we can kind of feel his emotion a little bit, right?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   But God sees that and shares how he wants the matter to be resolved
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   He commands Abraham to follow Sarah's response to send them away
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   We might wonder why would God even agree with that plan
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   I'm sure the intention behind is very different
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   God never intend to abandon Hagar and Ishmael
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Which we can see in the rest of the stories
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And I think here he is affirming his promise to Abraham and Sarah
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   That Isaac is the promised son
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Even though they messed things up, they came up with another plan
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And kind of created a problem here that cannot be resolved
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   God wants to show his faithfulness by providing a solution to the whole family
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   We can tell if things go on and the family stays together
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Things might go even worse, right?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   So God here is addressing this problem and showing that
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   I still care for your family
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Even though you messed up things a little bit
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And having something that you kind of deal with
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   So we see that God also has a role in this family, in this promised family
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   He concerns for each one of them
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And also take care of all members of the family
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   It might seem to us that Hagar and Ishmael are out of the promise
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   But God doesn't see that way
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   He also cares and helps them when they are wandering in the wilderness
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   So this is important for us
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   No matter how we are doing in our family
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   God is taking care of us
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   And his grace is enough for us in whatever situations we have
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   So after God gave his command
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   It is Abraham's turn to make a decision
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   As a father, it's hard to choose
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And after listening, he might also struggle
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   It's hard to just let his son go
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   But we definitely see that as a faith decision
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   We don't know what will happen after sending them away
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   We don't know whether they will survive
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   We don't know whether they can really become a big nation
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Because he can't see that
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   In those days, sending them away would mean that they will not meet again
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   So I wonder how he feels when he sends them away
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   But I think here, it's not only the faith
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Like, we trust God in every way and then we send them away
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   It's not like that
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   But actually, his action of faith, of sending them away
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Is an action of acknowledging God's role in our own family
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   And put our trust to God that he will take care of them
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Even though we don't see how things turn out
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And we don't know what's going on in the future
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   So I wonder how that speaks to us
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   To our personal roles and responsibilities in our family as well
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   That in some point, we can't control everything
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   We have to let go and let God work among our family members
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   To me, I think I really struggle with letting my brother go
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   We grew up together until a few years ago
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   He told me, "I actually want to move to another country to live in"
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I just want to let you know a little bit of our background
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   I'm a super planner
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I'm those who will go to travel with an Excel
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I plan everything ahead
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   But my brother is very chill
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   He's just like, "Whatever, I'm happy with anything"
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   So our personalities are very different
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   So when he told me that he wanted to move out
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   I was like, "Can you survive? You have a good job in Hong Kong
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Where are you going? You don't even know where you are going
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Do you have a plan? Do you know anyone?"
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   I asked him so many questions
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   I'm sure he was annoyed by me, by my questions
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Finally, in the end of 2022, he departed to Manchester in the UK
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   He was by himself, he's not married
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   He's just by himself and he has no friends there
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   I have some friends there, I wanted to introduce him
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   But he rejected me
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I'm like, "Are you serious?"
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   One night when I was overthinking my overthink
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   God spoke to me
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   He said, "He's an adult now, actually he's 26 when he moved out
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   You're not his mom either
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   It's okay that he can live by himself
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   He can flourish by himself
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   It really spoke to me that night
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Why am I overthinking?
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   My brother already said he would like to take charge of his life
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   He doesn't need my help
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Why do I not have peace to just let him flourish in the UK?
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   In fact, that's my personality
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Because my parents always taught me the responsibilities as an elder kid
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   I need to take care of my younger brother, my younger cousins
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   That's how I grew up
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I worry a lot when my brother is trying to do his own thing and out of my sight
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Last year I went with my dad to the UK to visit him
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   I saw how happy he is
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   He told me he planned ahead financially
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   That allowed him to have some time, not to rush himself to find a job
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   But really think about what he wants to do there
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   With his life, with everything
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Seeing him that at peace and enjoying his life
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Makes me really want to praise God for how he has been
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   With him, growing up and also taking care of him in the UK
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Even though I can't see, but I know that God takes care of him
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   So it was really a very humbling experience
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Just to let go of my control on my brother
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And see how he can flourish there
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   I know each one of you might have different parts
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Maybe not as a sibling
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   But there are a lot of things that we want to take care of
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   We think that's our responsibility
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Because this is how we are taught to be
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   But I wonder if there's anything you would like to just let go
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And submit that to God and allow him to intervene
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And take care of the rest of your families
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   So I wonder how the things can be different with God's intervention
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Let's go back to Abraham's story a little bit
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   The change, I don't know whether you are aware of where the change comes from
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   You have been doing your own thing
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And having Ishmael for a few years already
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   But God can only intervene when Sarah voices out something is wrong
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   So at the start of the story we see that
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Sarah saw how the two boys were playing together
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   And she thinks something is wrong here
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And she voices out to Abraham
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And then after that God starts to speak to Abraham on this matter
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   We see that, as I mentioned before, Abraham took a relatively passive role
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And we can see that he doesn't want to send the boys away
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Because he might not see that as a problem
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   But we can only resolve a problem when you acknowledge there is one
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   If you don't want to acknowledge it, nothing will be changed
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   So Abraham's position is not new to us
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   I want to address something, particularly in our culture
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   In Chinese culture, there are a lot of people who like to avoid conflict
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Many of us have huge conflict avoidance
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   We want to maintain the harmony at home and keep everyone together
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   But the harmony on the surface is not exactly what we want
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   We do not have peace just having harmony on the surface
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   And seeing the tension, like my family's tension on the table
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   It's not true peace, right?
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   And also we like to greet each other with blessings in the beginning of the year
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   That's a good thing to do, but let's not settle with that
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Let's not just settle with saying some blessings
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   But actually be a blessing to the people around us
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   So I wonder how we can actually be a blessing in our family
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   When there are things that we might not be able to control
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   I want to share a story with you, I struggle with that
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   But I feel I want to share with you today
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   My family is not, I struggle with my family basically
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   My parents are divorced, and before they divorced
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   They took a really long time with a lot of conflicts at home
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I know you might not expect this in Chinese New Year
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   But anyway, I'll just share
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   So one night, they were having a really intense fight with each other
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   My brother and I were sharing a room at that time
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And then we overheard their fight
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And then we were not sure what to do in the room
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   So as I said, my brother is a huge conflict avoidant
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And he was like, "Oh, I can't deal with that"
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   And then he also said, "I'm not sure whether you can deal with that as well"
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Because I have always been the firecracker at home
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   I make troubles and I stir things up
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And then I was like, "Yeah, maybe let's wait"
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   But it takes so long, it's like until 1am, it's not resolved yet
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And I'm like, I prayed and I have peace
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And I go out and talk to my parents
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And then what I did was just simply calming them down
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   I said, "You need to calm down right now"
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And it's 1am in the morning and we're not heading anywhere
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   And I don't know what will happen
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   That's all, and then I try to talk to them
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And they calm themselves down
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And decide to have a discussion later when they are calmer
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   So, that's the case, I didn't do anything
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   But the next day, my dad spoke to me
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   I am the only Christian at home
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And my dad spoke to me
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And he always be a little bit unsure whether he likes me as a Christian
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Because he just doesn't believe that
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And don't know what I'm doing in church
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   I'm always in church
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   But he spoke to me that morning and said
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   "Now I see how God works in your life"
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And you were never that calm in conflicts
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   But you did that very well last night
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And so I wonder, in the midst of our family dynamics
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   In the midst of different things going on in our family
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   How do we be the one that stands in front of God
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   And be the person that can minister God's goodness in our family
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   So I know that it's uneasy to do that
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   It's uneasy for me to do that as well
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   As we attend to the bigger gathering
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   There's too many things going on
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   But I wonder how we can do that
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   I want to encourage you with what Paul says to us
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   He describes us as God's temple
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   And the Holy Spirit dwells in us
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   That means people actually can meet God through us
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Because we are God's temple
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   In the past, people can only go to the temple to pray to God
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   To ask the priest to have sacrifice
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   And now, since Jesus Christ has come
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   And gave us the Holy Spirit
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   We are the temple
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   And people see God through us
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   So as we are
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Probably many of you will be going to family gatherings
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I want to encourage you that
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   There's a significance in you
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   And because God is in you
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   So I don't know how you can do that
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   You might feel I'm not that significant in my household
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And I don't have much to say
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   But God does not look contempt on you
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   He sees your role
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   He sees that you are important to your family
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   As your family members will see him through you
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   So
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   I would like to pray for us
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   So can I invite you to stand?
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Let's start with a little bit of reflections on ourselves
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Let's think about what role do we hold in our family
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   What relationship do we have?
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   How are we doing with interacting with the people?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   No matter what's going on
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   We know that God is with us
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   He sees our situation
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   He sees those unspoken things
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Even though we might not want to acknowledge
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Thank you
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Holy Spirit we want to invite you to be with us in our family
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   We acknowledge that we are imperfect
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   We mess things up
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   But your grace is enough
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   May you reveal to us
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Is there any area we need your help on?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   We don't necessarily need to
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   We solve everything by ourselves
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   But you are the father of our household as well
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   So may you speak to us and allow us to see
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   What we can bring your love and your grace to our family
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Perhaps some of us notice something is wrong
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And we are unsure how to say about it
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I pray that your wisdom and your strength is in us
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   May you give us strength
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Give us the words on how to communicate with our family
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   With love, with patience
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Some of us may be avoiding some difficult decisions or conversations
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   God we pray that you will guide us
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   And allow us to have the courage to bring you to our family
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   To bring you perhaps some of the solutions to our family as well
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   So Lord, we need you because we are imperfect
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   We don't know everything
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   We don't know how to handle every situation that we are going through
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   So Lord, we pray that you will come with us
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Perhaps some of us feel that we are nobody in our family
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   We can't really decide or contribute
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   But we know that in you we are not like that
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   We are important, we are significant as your children
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   So Lord, may your goodness flow out from us
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   May you use us in our family
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   To extend the real blessings to the people around us
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   As we gather, we pray that your goodness, your love, your faith will go with us
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   And you will minister to the people around us
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   To those who don't know you yet through us
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   So Lord, may we be your temple
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   May you show your goodness to the people around us, to our family
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Help us and be with us
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   We pray in Jesus name
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Amen
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Thank you
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Why don't we sing and declare this together
