1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
 (gentle music)

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,760
 Everyone says, hey, can we thank our worship team as always?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,520
 And as you sit down,

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,520
 please try to move into the middle of the row

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,360
 as much as possible.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,400
 We are totally, totally overflown.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,080
 We have a whole group of people out in the overflow.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,320
 Hey guys, great to have you with us in the overflow today.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,120
 We know that there are people standing on the stairs

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,300
 down the Cape of Sea.

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,920
 There are people upstairs as well standing on the stairs.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,980
 So if you have a spare seat next to you,

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,080
 can you please just, yeah, raise your hand.

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,760
 There's three seats right here, hosts.

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,960
 Three seats right here.

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
 There's a couple of seats over here.

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,080
 Come on in if you are outside and in need of a seat.

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,680
 And we are so grateful.

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,600
 We know people are sitting on stairs and stuff as well.

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,160
 So it's a good problem when church is full,

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,040
 but we wanna make sure that everybody feels comfortable

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,880
 and that we make sure that we have a room for everybody

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,720
 that's possible.

24
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,480
 Just a reminder, we have three services on a Sunday,

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,480
 9.15, 11 o'clock and two o'clock.

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,620
 I know 11 is the very convenient service

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,740
 'cause it means you get to sleep in

28
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,740
 and then you can go out for lunch.

29
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,700
 But if you want to, you can visit the two o'clock

30
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,540
 at any time.

31
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,980
 We would love to have you at the two o'clock or the 9.15.

32
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,860
 But welcome to church.

33
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,680
 Welcome to the Vine.

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,180
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.

35
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,500
 And we're continuing our series in Exodus.

36
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,580
 There's a couple of chairs here.

37
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,700
 I think there's two chairs right there, possibly.

38
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,780
 There's a chair, you can sit in my chair.

39
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,840
 I don't own my chair, my chairs.

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,220
 There's two chairs here.

41
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,020
 There's a chair down here.

42
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,900
 Awesome.

43
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,100
 All right, I'm gonna stop speaking about chairs

44
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,660
 and start speaking about Jesus.

45
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,400
 So,

46
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,200
 are you okay?

47
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,020
 You got a chair?

48
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,220
 You got a chair, awesome.

49
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,060
 Good to see you.

50
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,140
 So on Tuesday, April 17th, 2017,

51
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,220
 at exactly 11.15 in the morning,

52
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,780
 I saved somebody's life.

53
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,420
 And by that, I mean I literally saved their life.

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,380
 Like I'm convinced that if I had not been

55
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,640
 in that exact place at that exact time,

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,740
 the other person most definitely,

57
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,420
 without a shadow of doubt, have died.

58
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,660
 I was in China at the time.

59
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,820
 I was in the South of China at a resort,

60
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,260
 having a holiday with my wife, just the two of us.

61
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,900
 We decided to go on like a second honeymoon.

62
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
 We left our daughter Mia at home.

63
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,860
 We went with two friends of ours.

64
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,500
 And it just so happened that the husband

65
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,740
 that we were traveling with, with these other friends,

66
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,880
 he was a senior member of the hotel group

67
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,440
 that we were staying at and the place

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,800
 that we were staying in.

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,800
 And on April 11th, we had this incredible breakfast,

70
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,160
 late breakfast.

71
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,680
 We'd slept in, had this great breakfast.

72
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,640
 And after breakfast, we decided that we wanted to go

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,000
 to the one pool in the complex.

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,920
 There was about four pools in the complex.

75
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,240
 We wanted to go to the one where kids were not allowed.

76
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,360
 'Cause you know, when you're a parent

77
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,560
 and you travel without your kids,

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,040
 you wanna be without kids.

79
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,060
 You know what I'm saying?

80
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,740
 So we found the one pool in the resort

81
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,020
 where kids are banned, not allowed to go to.

82
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,380
 We go over there, we arrived there,

83
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,620
 and there are no other people in this pool.

84
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,420
 No one is around the pool at all.

85
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,300
 No one's swimming there or anything like that.

86
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,660
 So we think this is fantastic.

87
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,620
 We're all on our own.

88
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,540
 So we basically find these two lounge chairs

89
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,660
 on the side of the pool.

90
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,260
 We sit down, we start to get ourselves nice and relaxed

91
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,360
 and everything like that.

92
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,580
 Within about three minutes or so,

93
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,200
 two people arrive in the pool.

94
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,540
 Now, there are three things you need to know

95
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,640
 about these two people.

96
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,420
 The first is, it was pretty obvious

97
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,380
 that this was a daughter and her mother.

98
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,160
 The daughter was probably in her late thirties.

99
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,460
 The mother, I would say maybe late sixties,

100
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,300
 something like that.

101
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,740
 It was a mother and a daughter.

102
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,340
 The second thing you need to know about them

103
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,740
 was that they were fully clothed, okay?

104
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,260
 They were not dressed for the beach or the pool.

105
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,660
 They were fully clothed completely.

106
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,900
 And by the time, while they were walking around the pool

107
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,820
 and talking to each other,

108
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,940
 they were talking in Mandarin Chinese.

109
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,780
 I don't speak Mandarin,

110
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,080
 so didn't know what they were saying,

111
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,020
 but I could tell by their gestures

112
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,980
 and the way they're talking

113
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,180
 that neither of them could swim.

114
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,140
 The third thing you need to know about this couple

115
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,300
 was that the mother was carrying with her

116
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,220
 one of those massive inflatable unicorn things

117
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,060
 that you see in the pool.

118
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,180
 You know, those really annoying unicorn things

119
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,580
 that people like to lie on for the gram, right?

120
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,340
 This almost 70 year old mother

121
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,840
 was carrying one under her arm,

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,540
 which I thought was bizarre

123
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,860
 'cause they were wearing clothes

124
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,400
 and it was very obvious that they cannot swim.

125
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,620
 So I was kind of keeping half an eye on them over my book.

126
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,180
 You know, anyone else people watch when you're on holiday?

127
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,940
 Come on, you know you do.

128
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,780
 You know you do.

129
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,360
 I'm sitting there and I'm like, this is bizarre.

130
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,460
 Sure enough, the daughter goes down by the stairs

131
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,020
 of the shallow end and she calls her mother over.

132
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,700
 She puts the big unicorn floatie in the pool

133
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,860
 and she gestures for her mother to sit on the floatie.

134
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,960
 As she's doing this, she gets out her camera.

135
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,960
 And by this point, I'm like, this is not going to end well.

136
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,780
 And as her mother sits on the floatie,

137
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,100
 she then pushes her mother out to the middle of the pool.

138
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,380
 Like just pushes the floatie out

139
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,860
 and gets her camera ready for the photo of her lifetime.

140
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,160
 At this point, I know disaster is looming.

141
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,700
 And this mother floats out to the middle of the pool

142
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,180
 and she tries to adjust her balance

143
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,980
 on this awkward floatie thing.

144
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,340
 And she leans forward and she flips it

145
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,840
 and she goes straight into the middle of the pool.

146
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,460
 I don't even think.

147
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,700
 I jump up from my chair.

148
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,540
 I run as fast as I can, 'cause I'm gonna save this woman.

149
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,660
 As I'm running, I realized something.

150
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,020
 I am also fully clothed.

151
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,380
 I have also just come from breakfast

152
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,420
 and I did not get changed at all.

153
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,540
 And I'm fully clothed.

154
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,940
 So as I'm running, I realized I'm wearing my glasses.

155
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,280
 I'm wearing my hat.

156
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,100
 So I whip off my glasses.

157
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,460
 I throw off my hat whilst I'm running.

158
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,420
 I get to the edge of the pool.

159
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,060
 It was literally a Superman moment,

160
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,860
 you know, taking the clothes off.

161
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,300
 I dive into the swimming pool.

162
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,900
 I swim under the water and I come up right under her

163
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,780
 as she's drowning.

164
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,340
 She's drowning there.

165
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,740
 Her daughter is screaming her head off,

166
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,420
 standing at the side of the pool.

167
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,820
 Now, the thing that saves my life and hers

168
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,620
 is that as I got to her,

169
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,340
 I realized I could stand on the bottom of the pool

170
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,060
 and just keep my head above water.

171
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,500
 Just keep my head above water.

172
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,900
 So I'm standing there just with my head above water.

173
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,820
 I flip her around 'cause she was facing down to the water.

174
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,080
 I flip her around and push her head up

175
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,780
 so that she can kind of see properly.

176
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,780
 I then get her in like a fireman's kind of lift thing

177
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,620
 like this.

178
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,980
 And I like as best I can kind of maneuver over

179
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,700
 to the stairs in the shallow end.

180
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,460
 Her daughter is there.

181
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,620
 She grabs her by the end.

182
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,440
 She yanks her up and they walk away.

183
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,980
 And I, I come up out of the water.

184
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,740
 I literally collapse on the deck of the pool,

185
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,920
 absolutely exhausted, but feeling like a hero.

186
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,980
 Now, yeah.

187
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:29,540
 Now my friend, who's a senior member of this hotel group,

188
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,860
 hears about this heroic action from this white guy

189
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,620
 at the swimming pool.

190
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,820
 And because of his connections,

191
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,580
 he was able to get the CCTV footage of this moment.

192
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,700
 Do you want to watch?

193
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,660
 Yeah, all right, here we go.

194
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,740
 Here it is, okay.

195
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,580
 Here she is.

196
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,380
 Okay, no, this is my wife, my wife here.

197
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,220
 Look at her.

198
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,220
 She's like not sure.

199
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,540
 She's trying to get balanced.

200
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,420
 Oh, get balanced.

201
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,180
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

202
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,000
 Okay, here we go.

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,300
 Look down here, look down here.

204
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,140
 Yeah.

205
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,380
 Yes.

206
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,880
 (congregation applauding)

207
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,620
 Now I'm like, I got her like, like I'm trying to work out.

208
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,100
 I'm trying to get her breathing.

209
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
 Finally, the pool guy shows up.

210
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,060
 Thank you.

211
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,300
 Like I got her in a fireman.

212
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,140
 Look, there she is.

213
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,900
 I got her in like this fireman's posy thing right there.

214
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,900
 I'm helping her and I save her life in the name of Jesus.

215
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,780
 Yeah.

216
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,620
 Not just a pastor.

217
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,340
 Real life superhero.

218
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,260
 I love my dive.

219
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,980
 My dive's like a really awkward dive.

220
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,900
 Anyway, you're probably wondering

221
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,260
 what has this got to do with the Exodus, right?

222
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,940
 Today we come to the story of Moses,

223
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,820
 a story which is birthed in this idea

224
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,060
 of somebody who reaches into the waters of death

225
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,620
 and brings somebody back to life.

226
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,380
 Last week when we were looking at the Exodus journey,

227
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,180
 we saw that this new Pharaoh comes to power in Egypt

228
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,520
 and out of both his own insecurities

229
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,820
 and the fear that he has

230
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,260
 for this large immigrant community in his land,

231
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,980
 he decides to throw them under slavery.

232
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,340
 He decides to oppress them, to disempower them.

233
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,620
 And he starts by enslaving them as we looked at last week,

234
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,060
 but then he decides very quickly

235
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,820
 to move from slavery to genocide.

236
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,940
 And he's worried about this rising army

237
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,860
 that could rise up amongst this group.

238
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,660
 And so he decides that he's going to kill every male boy.

239
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,340
 Now to do that, he calls on the midwives,

240
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,500
 the Israelite midwives,

241
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,080
 to actually do the process of killing.

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,060
 So as they're delivering the children,

243
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,780
 if they deliver a boy, they kill it.

244
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,140
 If they deliver a girl, they let it live.

245
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,620
 Now there are two incredibly brave midwives,

246
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,980
 as we saw last week,

247
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,460
 who decide that no, they're not gonna do this.

248
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,940
 They decide that they're not gonna bring into genocide

249
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,400
 those of their own flesh and blood,

250
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,660
 and they defy the order of Pharaoh.

251
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,380
 And when we pick up the story here this morning

252
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,380
 is right at this moment after the two women

253
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,820
 have defied Pharaoh,

254
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,580
 and Pharaoh realizes that his plans had been thwarted.

255
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,460
 Let me read this to you from Exodus 1, verse 22.

256
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,380
 Then Pharaoh gave this order to all of his people.

257
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,520
 Every boy that is born, you must throw into the Nile,

258
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,480
 but every girl can live.

259
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,660
 Pharaoh, knowing that he's been thwarted

260
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,500
 by these two incredibly brave Hebrew midwives,

261
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,700
 then turns to his people,

262
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,180
 rather than getting the Israelites to try to kill Israelites,

263
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,420
 he turns to his own people,

264
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,100
 and he says, "Here's what I want you to do.

265
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,920
 If you come across an Israel, a Hebrew boy,

266
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,180
 who's young, a child, I want you to grab that boy,

267
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,500
 and I want you to throw it into the Nile."

268
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,220
 Now, this is not a suggestion.

269
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,620
 This is a decree and a command of Pharaoh.

270
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,620
 And every Egyptian who is loyal to Pharaoh,

271
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,740
 which they all had to be,

272
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,020
 anytime they saw a Hebrew boy, this is what they should do.

273
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,940
 Pick up that child and literally throw him into the water.

274
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,860
 The word here, throw him, is really important.

275
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,340
 Throw them or throw into is really important.

276
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,060
 That word, remember, Moses is writing this,

277
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,580
 that word is a Hebrew word

278
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,820
 that means literally to abandon.

279
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,440
 And I want you to see what Moses is doing

280
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,100
 right at the start of this story.

281
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,460
 He's wanting us to understand what evil

282
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,060
 and what the enemy is always trying to do through slavery.

283
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,820
 He's always trying to abandon us from what is around us.

284
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,740
 Pharaoh decides that the best way that he can do this

285
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,300
 is abandon this child.

286
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,940
 And to abandon this child,

287
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,460
 to do this to the Israelites themselves,

288
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,300
 is to pick up the child and throw it in the water,

289
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,020
 to abandon it to the family,

290
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,580
 abandon it to their community,

291
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,900
 and abandon it, of course, to death.

292
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,420
 And this power of abandonment, as Moses is writing this,

293
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,460
 is wanting us to understand that this is not just a moment

294
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,780
 that Pharaoh is doing,

295
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,780
 this is something that's seeped into the reality

296
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,020
 of what all of our sin does.

297
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,700
 See, in our slavery to sin,

298
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,820
 sin is always at work to try to abandon us

299
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,940
 to our families, our careers, our loved ones,

300
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,180
 the things that are around us.

301
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,300
 You talk to anybody who has had the travesty

302
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,980
 of the slavery of addiction,

303
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,260
 and they'll tell you that story.

304
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,340
 You meet anyone who's been addicted to gambling,

305
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,740
 they will tell you that they've abandoned their possessions

306
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,620
 and were willing to abandon their possessions

307
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,180
 in order to feed that addiction.

308
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,700
 You talk to anybody who's been addicted to pornography

309
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,740
 or addicted to drugs,

310
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,820
 you'll find that they will do whatever it takes

311
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,420
 to abandon their family and their friends and their time

312
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,300
 to the things that they're addicted to.

313
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,020
 But it's not just addiction, it's any sin.

314
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,100
 Any sin that you are held captive to

315
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,900
 is at work within you to abandon you to what is around you.

316
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,180
 That's the work of sin.

317
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,940
 That's what the enemy is trying to do in your life.

318
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,780
 And it's important as you're on your own journey of Exodus,

319
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,260
 as you're thinking about what it means for you

320
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,180
 to go from slavery to greater freedom in your life,

321
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,060
 you need to realize that what sin is trying to do

322
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,660
 is abandon you to all that is good in your life,

323
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,820
 to strip that away from you.

324
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,380
 And one of the starting points

325
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,380
 of all of our journey in Exodus is to refuse to be abandoned,

326
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,780
 to refuse to move with an abandoned spirit.

327
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,380
 I want you to know this,

328
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,100
 that the greatest spiritual work that the enemy has

329
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,580
 over the global church is to fill the church with orphans,

330
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,580
 to fill the church with orphans in the spirit,

331
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,620
 those that feel alone, those that feel abandoned,

332
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,260
 those that feel given up on,

333
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,900
 those that feel separated from everybody else.

334
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,620
 And not just with an orphan spirit about themselves

335
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,180
 and the people around them, but most importantly,

336
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,740
 this is the work of the enemy

337
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,500
 to make us feel like we're an orphan to God,

338
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,660
 to make us feel like we're abandoned by him,

339
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,180
 that he has left us alone.

340
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,460
 And right at the start of this story,

341
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,100
 and Moses is about to unpack for us something incredible,

342
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,780
 he wants you to understand that the gateway into this story

343
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,220
 is the work that the enemy does

344
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,860
 through the reality of sin to abandon us.

345
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:22,060
 Now, he then says they're being abandoned into the Nile.

346
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,140
 Now, this is really important because the Nile,

347
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,460
 this is the first mention of the Nile

348
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,420
 in the whole of the book of Exodus.

349
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,220
 And the Nile is gonna go on to dominate

350
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,820
 actually some of the integrable moments

351
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,860
 of the early part of the Exodus story.

352
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,700
 You know, the five movements I've been teaching you

353
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,540
 throughout the series so far,

354
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,300
 slavery, promise, liberation, identity, and home,

355
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,620
 the first three of those, slavery, promise, and liberation,

356
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,020
 all are integral to the work of the Nile.

357
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,220
 The Nile features in critical moments

358
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,260
 of those three movements.

359
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,860
 And this is the first time we hear about the Nile.

360
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,940
 And you need to understand why the Nile

361
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,540
 was super important to the Egyptian people

362
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,260
 and how the Nile is then used by God to flip the story,

363
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,740
 flip the script, and use the Nile

364
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,540
 as a liberating place for God's people.

365
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,940
 And to help you to understand that,

366
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,460
 I wanna take you today to the banks

367
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,380
 of the River Nile in Egypt.

368
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,280
 Let's take a look.

369
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:29,940
 "Flowing some 4,180 miles

370
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,900
 "and covering one-sixth of the Earth's circumference,

371
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,980
 "the Nile River is almost twice as long

372
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,980
 "as the Mississippi, the Tigris, the Euphrates,

373
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,540
 "and the Colorado Rivers combined.

374
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,620
 "The river is formed from two sources.

375
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,900
 "The white Nile begins in Central Africa,

376
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,980
 "and the blue Nile begins in the Ethiopian highlands.

377
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,980
 "They merge together in Khartoum,

378
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,700
 "where they flow some further 1,600 miles

379
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
 "to the Mediterranean."

380
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,300
 Historians believe that Egyptian civilization

381
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,340
 began about 6,000 years before Christ,

382
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,860
 as early settlements began to pop up around the Nile,

383
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,420
 not too far from where I'm standing right now.

384
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,620
 And not surprisingly, the Nile became a source

385
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,140
 of all life for Egyptians,

386
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,180
 and became the center imagery

387
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,380
 in so much of their mythology.

388
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,380
 But I think it was Napoleon who put it best

389
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,660
 when describing Egypt to his contemporaries.

390
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,120
 He said, "In the Nile, Egypt has the spirit of good.

391
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,860
 "In the desert, the spirit of evil."

392
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,180
 And I think Israel would not disagree,

393
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,780
 because the Nile would be the good

394
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,360
 that begins their journey,

395
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,580
 but the desert, the struggle that would come to define it,

396
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,180
 and to understand all of that,

397
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,220
 I wanna take us on a journey down the Nile ourselves.

398
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,800
 (gentle music)

399
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,640
 (water splashing)

400
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,480
 (water splashing)

401
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,320
 (water splashing)

402
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,160
 (water splashing)

403
00:16:51,160 --> 00:17:09,220
 (fire crackling)

404
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,980
 (fire crackling)

405
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:29,620
 All slavery begins with a simple step,

406
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,220
 the devaluing of human life.

407
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,220
 Once we devalue the life of another,

408
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,140
 we open ourselves up to perhaps the most sobering reality

409
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,740
 of the human condition,

410
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,340
 that regardless of how good or moral we might think we are,

411
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,480
 all of us are capable of committing

412
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,380
 the worst kinds of atrocities imaginable.

413
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,640
 Enslaving the other is the potential of us all.

414
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,660
 This is why our story starts here on the Nile,

415
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,460
 for it's in these very waters

416
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,260
 that Pharaoh orders all newborn Israelite boys

417
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,860
 to be thrown in.

418
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,980
 Innocent children are murdered here

419
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,300
 simply because some people have decided

420
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,060
 that they no longer have an intrinsic value of life.

421
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,380
 Long before God turns these waters red in the plagues,

422
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,360
 Pharaoh does so with the blood of a thousand Hebrew boys.

423
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,700
 The source of all life has now become a graveyard of death.

424
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,460
 But stories of redemption and freedom

425
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,980
 so often are birthed out of the very same places

426
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,200
 where the worst acts of humanity actually take place,

427
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,260
 and the Nile is no exception.

428
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,420
 For it will be in and out of these waters

429
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,860
 that would come two acts from incredibly courageous women

430
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,500
 that demonstrate to us the very first step

431
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,220
 that is required in any fight against evil

432
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,740
 and its enslavement,

433
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,580
 the resolute conviction of the gift of a human life.

434
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,300
 In the midst of mass genocide,

435
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,220
 a Levite family bears a son.

436
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,540
 Their culture taught them

437
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,060
 that he was special and valuable from birth,

438
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,580
 a gift from God.

439
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,660
 This belief gives the mother the courage

440
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,940
 to resist the orders of an empire

441
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,680
 and do all that she can to try to save him,

442
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,060
 even if it would mean her own death in doing so.

443
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,020
 So she takes a wicker basket,

444
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,580
 and in a decision of selfless courage,

445
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,900
 places her son amongst the reeds in the waters of the Nile.

446
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,820
 It was a pure act of suffering love.

447
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,000
 The only way that she could save him

448
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,660
 was through the sacrifice of letting him go.

449
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,460
 And so the boy is placed into the very waters

450
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,900
 his peers had been drowned in.

451
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,640
 And as destiny would have it,

452
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,700
 the very daughter of the man who decreed their deaths

453
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,140
 is the very one who would bring him back to life.

454
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,260
 Redemption has a way of ensuring no irony is lost.

455
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,780
 This is the Bible's first story of adoption.

456
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,580
 And like all stories of adoption,

457
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,140
 it's only made possible through the courageous acts

458
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,700
 of those that value the intrinsic nature of life.

459
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,040
 So a Hebrew mother moved to a selfless act of sacrifice

460
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,820
 in order to save her son.

461
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,180
 Or take a Pharaoh's daughter,

462
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,420
 moved to listen to her own heart

463
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,240
 as she stands against her father's decrees.

464
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,500
 And behind them both,

465
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,620
 a God who's always moved to use ordinary people

466
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,620
 to do extraordinary things.

467
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,860
 This is how any act of Exodus from hopelessness begins.

468
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,340
 And may it also then be for us.

469
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,100
 May you know a God who is able to draw you

470
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,940
 out of the darkest of waters

471
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,940
 so he might then adopt you into his family.

472
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:54,880
 - Genocide, abandonment, sacrifice, release,

473
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,380
 the idea of being cut off,

474
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,860
 and yet then salvation and redemption

475
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,900
 within the very same context that brought that abandonment.

476
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,340
 This story right here has incredible power to it.

477
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,520
 And there's so much here

478
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,920
 that I wanna hopefully communicate to you

479
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,420
 so that you can really begin what it is that,

480
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,980
 really understand what it is that God is doing

481
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,880
 in this beginning part of Exodus for you.

482
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,020
 Let me read on from Exodus chapter two, verse one.

483
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,260
 It says, "Now a man of the house of Levi

484
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,860
 married a Levite woman,

485
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,860
 and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son.

486
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,020
 When she saw that he was a good child,

487
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,800
 she hid him for three months.

488
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,380
 But when she could hide him no longer,

489
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,760
 she got a papyrus basket for him

490
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,200
 and coated it with tar and pitch.

491
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,660
 Then she placed the child in it

492
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,660
 and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.

493
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,040
 His sister stood at a distance

494
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,480
 to see what would happen to him."

495
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,140
 It's really interesting what Moses does here

496
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,180
 as he's telling the story.

497
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,800
 He's trying to bring a big contrast for you as the reader.

498
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,540
 First of all, he's just started with this idea

499
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,740
 that Pharaoh has changed tactics now

500
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,780
 and is now abandoning all of these children

501
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,380
 to their death in the Nile.

502
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,720
 But as soon as he said that,

503
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,060
 he then opens up a very ordinary story to you.

504
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,700
 He tells you a story about an ordinary Levite family

505
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,220
 who are just people that fell in love,

506
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,020
 got married and decided to have a child.

507
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,080
 And when we read the story,

508
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,820
 we think it's just kind of this light idea.

509
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,660
 But if you think about the context of the moment,

510
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,740
 a couple who were Israelites at this time having a child,

511
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,540
 that was a very courageous decision.

512
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,700
 It was a very brave thing to do

513
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,940
 because they knew the edict

514
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,100
 that was under the world and Egypt at this time.

515
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,980
 They knew that Pharaoh had said that if they had a boy,

516
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,500
 that that boy would be murdered, boy would be slaughtered.

517
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,640
 And so as you became pregnant in that time,

518
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,020
 you would have been feeling all this anxiety.

519
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
 If I give birth to a girl,

520
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,140
 well, I guess the girl will live.

521
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,940
 If I give birth to a boy,

522
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,980
 then sadness and travesty will come under us.

523
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,180
 So just the idea of becoming pregnant

524
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,300
 was an incredibly risky thing to do at that time.

525
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,300
 But this couple decided it was a risk worth taking.

526
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,420
 And we're told right here that she has a boy.

527
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,540
 And it's really interesting what it says.

528
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,220
 And this is one of the critical bits in this whole passage.

529
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,300
 It says, "When she saw that he was a good child."

530
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,120
 I love this idea of the idea of him being a good child.

531
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,300
 Now, you gotta be careful here.

532
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,500
 This is not talking about some moral statement.

533
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,940
 It wasn't that this child

534
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,060
 was particularly a good behaving child.

535
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,700
 It wasn't like he was just well-behaved and never cried

536
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,340
 and was just so nice that she decided to keep him.

537
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,500
 As if the implication was if it was a naughty child,

538
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,140
 she'd throw him in the river herself.

539
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,700
 That's not what it's saying here.

540
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,680
 The word good here, remember, I've been saying each week

541
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,700
 that Moses, as he's writing this story,

542
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,440
 he's wanting to connect it to his other writings in Genesis.

543
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,560
 That's what's happening here.

544
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,920
 The word good here is exactly the same word

545
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,720
 that Moses writes in Genesis 1 and 2

546
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,080
 to describe what God thinks,

547
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,960
 what God feels at the end of every day of creation.

548
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,160
 He stands back from that day of creation

549
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,400
 and he says, "This is good."

550
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,600
 The idea being that this is just as I've designed it to be.

551
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,720
 This is just as it should be.

552
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,560
 It's not a moral statement from God.

553
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,420
 It's a statement that the world in that moment

554
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,180
 is just in his will.

555
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,180
 It looks and it is as he desires it to be.

556
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,980
 To say that it is good is to say that it is under my control,

557
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,260
 it is in my hands, it is just as I want it to be,

558
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,140
 and everything is all set.

559
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,540
 The idea of shalom and peace

560
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,540
 is captured in this word of good.

561
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,900
 So here's a Hebrew mother who's just given birth to a boy

562
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,900
 who should be killed, but she sees that this is good.

563
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,440
 She stands back from creation like God does

564
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,520
 and she describes it as good.

565
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,080
 What she's saying is, even though this is a boy

566
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,960
 and even though we're not supposed to be having boys

567
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,280
 at this time, I know that this is in line with God's will,

568
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,560
 that God has willed me to bring a son into this world

569
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,240
 so this child has value, this child has intrinsic worth,

570
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,000
 this child is good in God's eyes.

571
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,420
 It is well with him, it is well with his soul,

572
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,840
 it is in line with his purposes and his promises,

573
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,040
 and she sees that and because of that,

574
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,000
 it drives everything she does next.

575
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,040
 It's like Moses is wanting you to understand

576
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,200
 the theological thinking of this woman

577
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,800
 'cause we look at her and we think,

578
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,240
 wow, she's incredibly brave, and Moses is saying,

579
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,880
 you wanna know where that bravery comes from?

580
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,280
 It's because she can see God's goodness,

581
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,820
 the goodness of God in her son.

582
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,160
 She sees that this son is in the will of God,

583
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,200
 what the will is for him.

584
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,480
 Even if this son is gonna be killed,

585
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,480
 it was still in the will of God and she can declare it good.

586
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,640
 In other words, I don't judge the will of God

587
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,140
 by whether something goes well or not.

588
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,880
 Come on, church.

589
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,940
 I don't judge, she's saying, the will of God

590
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,720
 by whether I'm happy or not.

591
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,080
 I judge the will of God by whether he declares it or not.

592
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,440
 Does he declare this good?

593
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,080
 This child is good.

594
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,920
 So that idea then drives what she does next.

595
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,200
 She takes a papyrus basket

596
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,260
 and she coats it with tar and pitch.

597
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,440
 Now, very importantly, what Moses is writing here,

598
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,720
 what he's saying is, he uses a word for basket here

599
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,000
 that he only uses in a few other times

600
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,520
 in the whole of his writings.

601
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,720
 One other time that he uses it is in Genesis 6 to 8,

602
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,360
 chapter 6 to 8, where he's describing Noah and the ark.

603
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,760
 The ark and the word basket is the same word.

604
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,400
 What he's trying to communicate to us

605
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,240
 is that this mother who knows that this child

606
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,560
 is in the will of God, she then takes a basket,

607
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,200
 she takes a ark and she pitches,

608
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,440
 she puts the tar and the stuff, that waterproofs it.

609
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,280
 Interestingly, those are exactly the same two words

610
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,640
 that Noah uses to make his ark

611
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,440
 and to make the ark waterproof.

612
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,380
 Notice, the ark was designed to be a vessel

613
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,320
 that could carry humanity to safety,

614
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,200
 to life on the waters of death.

615
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,480
 Are you with me?

616
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,960
 So Moses says, what the mother does here

617
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
 is because he sees this child is good,

618
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,760
 she creates her own ark for this child.

619
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,680
 And she places the child in her ark

620
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,900
 and she sets it off amongst the reeds of the Nile.

621
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,960
 In other words, you've probably read this story before

622
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,560
 and you think that she's abandoning her child

623
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,100
 because she can't dare to see the child be killed.

624
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,700
 Remember, it is Pharaoh that's abandoning.

625
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,720
 She's not abandoning, she's dedicating.

626
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,920
 She's releasing.

627
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,320
 She's having the audacity to say,

628
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,940
 because this child is good,

629
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,600
 this is God's child more than it is my child.

630
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,300
 And I'm gonna place this child in an ark,

631
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,460
 in something that could be a vessel of true life for him

632
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,180
 and I'm going to release it in trust of God.

633
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,680
 I'm gonna release the gift that God has given me.

634
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,000
 I'm gonna give it back to God

635
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,720
 and I'm gonna set it out on this water.

636
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,440
 The waters that should be killing him

637
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
 are gonna be waters that will bring him life.

638
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,040
 I'm gonna put it in God's hands.

639
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,280
 I'm gonna trust and release.

640
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,000
 And what Moses in writing this is wanting you to understand

641
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 is the dichotomy that there is

642
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,440
 between Pharaoh that wants to abandon

643
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,320
 and a mother that so trusts God

644
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,440
 that she's willing to release the God.

645
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,440
 She's willing to give to God all the things that are there

646
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,660
 and this difference is gonna be what we're gonna see play out

647
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,740
 in the whole of the Exodus journey.

648
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,740
 And this mother makes the decision

649
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,300
 that she's willing to release to God.

650
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,980
 You need to understand that if you truly want freedom

651
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,060
 for yourself and for others,

652
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,020
 then you're gonna have to have the courage

653
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,400
 to release everything you have into the hands of God.

654
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,860
 Come on church.

655
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,780
 If you really wanna be on an Exodus journey,

656
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,700
 if you really wanna go from slavery to freedom,

657
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,840
 you're gonna have to have the courage

658
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,300
 to release all the things in your life

659
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,400
 into the hands of God.

660
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,560
 You're gonna have to have the faith

661
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,200
 to believe that God can be at work in the things

662
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,300
 as you give them to him.

663
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,420
 You're gonna have to say,

664
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,720
 even though I don't fully understand,

665
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,100
 even though I don't know what's actually gonna result,

666
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,280
 I believe that God has a victory

667
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,800
 that's far greater than the victory

668
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,680
 I could ever defy for myself.

669
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,000
 I'm willing to release into his hands

670
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,620
 and trust for his provision.

671
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,840
 That's gonna be the journey you're all gonna be caught on.

672
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,780
 And here's the thing,

673
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,600
 we're all okay with releasing the stuff

674
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,420
 that we wanna get rid of, amen.

675
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,720
 Like when you hear a story about releasing stuff,

676
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,960
 you're thinking to yourself like,

677
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,540
 sure I'll release, I'll release the bad relationships

678
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,080
 that are dragging me down.

679
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,660
 I'll release the bad habits

680
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,880
 that I know are not good for me.

681
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,040
 I'll release all the mucky stuff in my life

682
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,720
 'cause I want the best life I can have.

683
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,380
 Here's the challenge.

684
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,740
 This mother gives away the greatest thing

685
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,980
 she had ever received, the birth of a son.

686
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,100
 And here's the really important point.

687
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,200
 Even the blessings in your life,

688
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,860
 if they are not wholly given over to God,

689
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,580
 will actually become the very things

690
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
 that will eventually enslave you.

691
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:23,140
 Is anybody here?

692
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,960
 Even the blessings, even the good things,

693
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,220
 if we hold onto them too tightly,

694
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,980
 will eventually become the things

695
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,300
 that the enemy use to enslave us.

696
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,420
 See, the reality is that God gives us blessings

697
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,060
 and the blessings of God are good things,

698
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,260
 but so often what happens when God blesses us

699
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,740
 with a great career, with great finances,

700
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,060
 with a great relationship,

701
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,180
 so often we can take the blessings of God

702
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,020
 and then we can magnify those things

703
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,020
 and they can become an idol for us.

704
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,260
 And the very thing that was a blessing from God

705
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,100
 becomes a thing that enslaves us in idolatry.

706
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,700
 Some of you in this room are enslaved to your work,

707
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,900
 which was originally a gift from God to you,

708
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,560
 but you've now turned it into an idol

709
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
 and it's slaving you, it's driving you.

710
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,960
 Some of you are enslavement to the finances.

711
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,520
 God's blessed you financially and it's been great,

712
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,200
 but you've taken a hold of it too tightly

713
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,560
 and you're now controlling it

714
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,960
 and you're not giving God any room to use it

715
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,320
 and to move it through your life

716
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,560
 and you become enslaved by the very blessing

717
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,280
 that God has given you, this woman,

718
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,320
 in the courage that can only be found

719
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,780
 in understanding that God is good at all times.

720
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,240
 She's willing to release even her greatest blessing,

721
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,280
 trusting that God has his will and his plan.

722
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,740
 You will come into the greatest moments

723
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,020
 of freedom in your life when you're willing to let go,

724
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,840
 not just the bad stuff you carry,

725
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,340
 but even hold the good stuff lightly before him.

726
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,820
 That doesn't mean that you shouldn't be a steward

727
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,180
 of his stuff, doesn't mean that you don't steward

728
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,200
 the resource of God well,

729
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,500
 but it does mean that we have to be careful

730
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,460
 that we don't allow our stewardship of something

731
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,400
 to become an idol.

732
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,020
 And some of you need to just release,

733
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,580
 release what it is that you're holding in your hands,

734
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,460
 release what it is that you're experiencing in your life

735
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,020
 into a fullness of God's trust.

736
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,180
 And that courage to trust him like that

737
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,380
 will be the starting point of your exodus.

738
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,900
 It'll be the starting point of all that God can do.

739
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,340
 I wanna show you that although this mother

740
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,840
 does not abandon her child, God also does not abandon her.

741
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,820
 Notice what happens next.

742
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,300
 Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe,

743
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,260
 and her attendants were walking along the riverbank.

744
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
 She saw the basket among the reeds

745
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,620
 and sent her slave girl to get it.

746
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,380
 She opened it and saw the baby.

747
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,660
 He was crying and she felt sorry for him.

748
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,940
 "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.

749
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,120
 I want you to track with what happens in this moment.

750
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,960
 So here's the mother who releases on an ark

751
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,860
 that she's created her child into the hands of God.

752
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,140
 And here comes one of the oppressors,

753
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,840
 not just one of the oppressors,

754
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,740
 but the very daughter of the one who's doing the oppressing,

755
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,660
 the daughter of Pharaoh.

756
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,540
 And she sees this basket in the reeds

757
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,700
 where she's gonna bathe.

758
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,380
 She sends a slave girl to get it.

759
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,580
 She brings the basket to her.

760
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,860
 She opens it up, and immediately she sees

761
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,020
 that this is one of the Hebrew boys.

762
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,500
 Now, she in her mind is thinking,

763
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,100
 "I should kill this child."

764
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,260
 This is Pharaoh's daughter.

765
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,020
 So the decree is not just some Pharaoh in Egypt

766
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,960
 that I guess I have to do because he's Pharaoh.

767
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,600
 This is her own father.

768
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,840
 And there is no time in her life

769
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,280
 that this daughter has ever disobeyed her father.

770
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,940
 Pharaoh's daughters were powerful, influential authorities.

771
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,280
 They were an actual representation in their symbolicism

772
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,900
 of the power and the might of Egypt.

773
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,540
 There was no way that this girl

774
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,740
 would ever have disobeyed her dad.

775
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,260
 And here she is, and she says, "This is a Hebrew boy.

776
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,280
 "That means she should abandon him.

777
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,100
 "She should throw him in the water, and she doesn't do it."

778
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,440
 And the question Moses wants you to ask is why?

779
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,420
 What makes the difference here?

780
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,220
 Why does she decide not to abandon the child?

781
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,780
 He tells us right here, he says,

782
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,620
 "He was crying, and she felt sorry for him."

783
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,380
 The word sorry for there is a Hebrew word

784
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,140
 which actually literally translates as compassion.

785
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,360
 She felt compassion for him.

786
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,540
 This idea of compassion is gonna be a central theme

787
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,500
 in the Exodus journey.

788
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,140
 In fact, in just a couple of weeks time,

789
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,840
 we're gonna see when God decides to act

790
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,820
 on behalf of the Israelites,

791
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,580
 he decides to do so because he's moved with compassion.

792
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,180
 In fact, this compassion is what drives God

793
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,780
 to do all the things that he does

794
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,820
 to bring Israel out of their slavery into their freedom.

795
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,300
 Compassion will always be the starting point

796
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,140
 of any Exodus journey.

797
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,460
 But what's amazing here is that it's actually

798
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,780
 not God's compassion that starts Exodus.

799
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,580
 It's a woman's compassion that starts Exodus.

800
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,140
 And it's not just any woman,

801
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,380
 but it's a woman who is a part of the oppressors.

802
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,060
 I want you to see what God is doing here.

803
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,820
 He's taking one of the very oppressors of his own people,

804
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,980
 and he's using her to have the compassion

805
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,540
 that will begin an Exodus journey

806
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,900
 through the saving of Moses' life.

807
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,060
 God takes the heart of the one

808
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,620
 who should have thrown the child into abandonment,

809
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,580
 and he changes that heart

810
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,980
 so that she would have compassion to act differently.

811
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,580
 And the way that that word is written,

812
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,740
 it's written in such a way

813
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,620
 that it's actually describing God's power in that decision.

814
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,880
 In other words, her compassion is not just her compassion.

815
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,400
 God is at work in her to make her compassionate

816
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,700
 so that she will do this act

817
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,920
 in order to save a Hebrew child.

818
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,900
 More than I think the two midwives that we saw last week

819
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,400
 who have incredible courage,

820
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,740
 this woman has even more courage

821
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,620
 because the back that she's turning,

822
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,120
 she's turning her back on her own father.

823
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,740
 This is personal to her.

824
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,220
 But she does it because there is this transformation

825
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,340
 that happens in her heart by the Spirit of God.

826
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,100
 Even though she doesn't worship God,

827
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,380
 she doesn't believe in God,

828
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,860
 she never thinks about God,

829
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,940
 and God is still at work 'cause God can take anybody

830
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,380
 and change their hearts for his purposes.

831
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,900
 And some of you need to hear that in this room

832
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,980
 in your Exodus journey.

833
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,220
 God can take anyone,

834
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,100
 and he can use his Spirit to change their heart

835
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,040
 so he can sweep them up in his redemptive work

836
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,280
 that he does in this world.

837
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,320
 It's not just us Christians that get to enjoy that.

838
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,700
 God even uses anyone, anyone, even a non-Christian

839
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,780
 can be swept up in the power of God.

840
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,260
 Their hearts can be changed,

841
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,620
 and they can actually maybe even inadvertently

842
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,580
 begin to work on behalf of God's will.

843
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,980
 That's how powerful our God is.

844
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,100
 That's the victory that he has,

845
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,060
 that he's willing to stand over a group of people

846
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,420
 and say, "I will work on every human heart

847
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,260
 "to bring my purposes in this world."

848
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,600
 And for some of you in this room,

849
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,980
 that's a word in season for you

850
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,160
 because you're in a relationship right now

851
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,540
 where you've been praying for a long time

852
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,500
 for God to change their heart about something.

853
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,500
 And you think that that heart cannot be changed.

854
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,980
 You think that there's no way that that heart can be changed.

855
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,940
 You've kind of given up.

856
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,980
 Some of you in this room, some of you are parents,

857
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,740
 and you've been praying for the salvation of your children.

858
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,740
 And you look at your children and what they do

859
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,660
 and how they act, and you think to yourself,

860
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,300
 they're about as far away from Jesus

861
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,820
 as I could ever imagine.

862
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,220
 I don't think they're ever gonna come to faith.

863
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,140
 Some of you have been praying for your adult children,

864
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,300
 and you're desperate to see them come to Jesus,

865
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,980
 and you think they're never gonna change.

866
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,780
 Some of you are in a difficult relationship and work,

867
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,300
 and you're like, God, if you only stepped in

868
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,940
 and changed this person's perspective,

869
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,460
 then my life would be a lot easier,

870
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,900
 but you don't think it's gonna happen.

871
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,300
 And here's a story where the daughter of the oppressor

872
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,220
 has her heart changed by God so she can set people free.

873
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,300
 And that should encourage you never to stop praying.

874
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,180
 Never give up in prayer.

875
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,380
 If you've been praying for your child to come to Jesus,

876
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,900
 never give up on your prayer.

877
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,500
 He's at work.

878
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,420
 If you're praying for God to liberate you

879
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,900
 from some situation that you're in

880
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,020
 where you're feeling oppressed,

881
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,940
 and you think that person's heart can never change

882
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,740
 to have a softer heart towards you, don't give up praying.

883
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,420
 God can step in, and God can do the very things

884
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,700
 that we would never think he could do.

885
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:21,940
 And what's really beautiful and profound about this

886
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,500
 is that as God's at work in this woman's heart to do this,

887
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,580
 his heart is still so much for the mother.

888
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,780
 I wanna show you what happens next.

889
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,220
 Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter,

890
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,980
 "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women

891
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,740
 "to nurse this baby for you?"

892
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,460
 "Yes, go," she answered.

893
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,860
 And the girl went and got the baby's mother.

894
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,060
 Pharaoh's daughter said to her,

895
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,780
 "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you."

896
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,900
 So the woman took the baby and nursed him.

897
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,860
 I want you to follow what's happening here

898
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,980
 'cause we serve a God who's able to turn things around.

899
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,780
 We serve a God that when you release, he will give back.

900
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,460
 We serve a God that when we step out in faith,

901
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,980
 he will do things that we never thought he would do

902
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,660
 to come around and turn things around.

903
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,620
 Here's a story of a mother who releases on an ark,

904
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,580
 believing that God can save her child,

905
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,420
 but was probably thinking,

906
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,180
 "I'm never gonna see him before again.

907
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,460
 "I'm never gonna see him again.

908
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
 "I'm releasing him.

909
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,540
 "I'm giving him to the Lord.

910
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,660
 "I don't know what's gonna happen."

911
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,940
 Here's a God who takes the oppressor

912
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,780
 and he breaks the oppressor's heart by his spirit,

913
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,500
 who takes this child out of the waters of death,

914
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,540
 decides to then have this child.

915
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,020
 Oh, and then it just so happens that Miriam,

916
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,020
 the child's sister, is standing nearby.

917
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,100
 She shows up and goes,

918
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,420
 "Oh, I know someone who could actually look

919
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,420
 "after that child for you and nurse that child."

920
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,220
 The child goes into that person's hand.

921
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,540
 That person takes it back to the mother,

922
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,820
 and the mother gets to raise the child,

923
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,340
 and get this, she's paid for it.

924
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,420
 (congregation laughing)

925
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,300
 I mean, if you wanna know a story of redemption,

926
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,300
 a story of God's heart for his people,

927
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,340
 he's saying, "This is how Exodus begins.

928
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,420
 "I changed the heart of the oppressor,

929
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,620
 "and I have not abandoned Moses,

930
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,380
 "but I also have not abandoned this mother,

931
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,540
 "and she's gonna raise this child,

932
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,140
 "and she's gonna be the only Hebrew mother

933
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:12,540
 "in the whole of Egypt who is allowed to raise a boy

934
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,860
 "under the very obedience of Pharaoh himself."

935
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,140
 Pharaoh's household provides her the protection

936
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,740
 to be able to raise the child

937
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,020
 that should have been abandoned in the waters.

938
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,100
 I said in the film that so often,

939
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,900
 redemption and freedom is birthed out of the very places

940
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,100
 where the worst expressions of oppression have occurred.

941
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,220
 You need to know on your journey of Exodus,

942
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,920
 the places that you think are the most broken in you,

943
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,520
 the places where you think God is the furthest away,

944
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,220
 the places where you think you're never going

945
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,580
 to get anything out of that,

946
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,340
 those are the very places God loves to birth his hope.

947
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,220
 Those are the very places that God loves to turn around.

948
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,460
 Those are the moments where God steps in,

949
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,420
 and goes, "You thought that this would never happen.

950
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,940
 "Watch what I can do, 'cause I'm the God of the Exodus."

951
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,460
 I love this.

952
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,300
 There are some of us in this room

953
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,060
 where what you think is absolutely incomprehensible

954
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,560
 could never happen, God already sees as having had happened.

955
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,740
 For when this mother gives this child in the ark,

956
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,460
 and releases this child in the basket, God already knew.

957
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,660
 You could almost see him standing over her going like,

958
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,140
 (laughing)

959
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,860
 if only you knew what was about to happen, right?

960
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,460
 You can almost sense God's excitement for her,

961
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,340
 that in her obedience of her letting go in faith,

962
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,540
 God is like, "I'm gonna reward that faith.

963
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,620
 "I'm gonna reward that faith

964
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,760
 "by giving this child back to you.

965
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,060
 "I'm not only giving this child back to you,

966
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,560
 "I'm gonna protect you so you can raise him,

967
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,040
 "and not only that, I'm gonna pay you

968
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,100
 "so that you can then provide for your wider family.

969
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,620
 "This is all happening because I reward faith."

970
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,100
 And you need to understand that that's what God does.

971
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,940
 God rewards faith.

972
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,420
 And sometimes we worry about saying that in church,

973
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,480
 because we're so afraid of the prosperity gospel.

974
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,740
 But we also have to realize that

975
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,700
 in being afraid of the prosperity gospel,

976
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,860
 we gotta be careful that we don't become

977
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,260
 the impoverished gospel.

978
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:10,380
 And there's a center line here, where God does reward faith.

979
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,380
 And it's gonna require faith for you

980
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,300
 to step out in your own exodus.

981
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,420
 It's gonna require courage and faith for you

982
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:20,260
 to let go of even the very things that are blessing you

983
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,940
 to ensure that they don't become idols.

984
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,060
 It's gonna take faith in you

985
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,580
 to know that God is at work and that it is good,

986
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:31,260
 even though it might seem like it's overwhelmingly bad.

987
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:36,260
 Faith is an important part of your exodus.

988
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,820
 And here's this Pharaoh's daughter

989
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,200
 who does an incredible thing,

990
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,160
 brave thing to stand against her father

991
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,560
 so that the child would be set free.

992
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,560
 Notice verse 10.

993
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,980
 When the child grew older,

994
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,780
 she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son.

995
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,780
 She named him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of the water."

996
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,140
 See, Pharaoh's daughter didn't just draw Moses

997
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,020
 out of the water and give it back to the Hebrew family

998
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,320
 and then forget about him.

999
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,620
 She drew him out of the water

1000
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,340
 because she wanted to take him into her family.

1001
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,180
 And as I said in the film,

1002
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,860
 this is the Bible's first story of adoption.

1003
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,220
 And adoption from this point forward

1004
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,620
 is gonna become the main metaphor

1005
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,300
 that the Bible uses to speak about the redemption work

1006
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,740
 of God.

1007
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,580
 In the New Testament,

1008
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,300
 we know that the early church would use the adoption metaphor

1009
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,620
 to help speak about Gentiles.

1010
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,700
 And if you're in this room right now watching online

1011
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,900
 and you're not of Jewish descent, then you are a Gentile.

1012
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,140
 And you're a part of the incredible story of God

1013
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,380
 because you have now been swept up in his adoptive power,

1014
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,580
 that he has adopted you out of the waters of death

1015
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,400
 and brought you now into his family.

1016
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,620
 You are his child now.

1017
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,340
 And that whole metaphor, that whole journey starts here.

1018
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,420
 And you see, adoption is about the reversing

1019
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,500
 of the curse of abandonment.

1020
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,380
 Notice this, guys.

1021
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,180
 Adoption is about the reversing of the curse of abandonment.

1022
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,460
 Adoption is the very opposite

1023
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,820
 of what a Pharaoh is trying to do here.

1024
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,700
 He's trying to abandon these children,

1025
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,260
 but his own daughter moved in compassion

1026
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,460
 'cause the Spirit is at work in her heart,

1027
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,660
 is willing to draw this child out of the waters

1028
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,500
 and bring it into her own family.

1029
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,020
 And as she's doing that,

1030
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,060
 she's standing against the very abandonment

1031
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,500
 that her father has decreed,

1032
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,820
 and she's saying, "No, this is family."

1033
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,340
 In drawing Moses out of the water,

1034
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,020
 what she's doing is drawing the boundaries of her family

1035
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,820
 much broader than the confines of bloodline.

1036
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:39,440
 It's hard to describe to you the travesty

1037
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,420
 of what it would have meant for Pharaoh and his family

1038
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,540
 that now a Hebrew child was part of the family.

1039
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,980
 That was deeply, deeply embarrassing for them.

1040
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,080
 And this daughter was the one who was willing to say,

1041
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:57,080
 "We're gonna draw our family broader than just bloodline."

1042
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,960
 Notice what she calls him.

1043
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,380
 She calls him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of water."

1044
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,300
 This is really interesting.

1045
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,340
 I wanna just close on this.

1046
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,780
 There's no way that Pharaoh's daughter

1047
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,500
 spoke Hebrew or understood Hebrew.

1048
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,580
 Just would not have been a thing.

1049
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,220
 So she doesn't call him Moses in the Hebrew sense.

1050
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,340
 She calls him Moses in the Egyptian sense.

1051
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,540
 Interestingly, Moses was actually a compound word

1052
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,460
 that was used in Egypt at that time.

1053
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,060
 The word itself actually is this word here.

1054
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,260
 It's M-S/M-S-I.

1055
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,060
 I know that doesn't really kind of sound like anything,

1056
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:38,580
 but it means to give birth, to have a child or a son.

1057
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,860
 And it's used, so these two people here

1058
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,300
 are pharaohs of this time, Thutmose and Rameses.

1059
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,660
 I want you to notice the Moses on Thutmose

1060
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,220
 and the Meses on Rameses.

1061
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,020
 That's both this compound word that means Moses.

1062
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,660
 So Thutmose means Thoth is born.

1063
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,940
 Rameses means Ra is born.

1064
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,700
 So it's always this person is born.

1065
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,700
 So something Moses, does that make sense?

1066
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,380
 It's a little bit like in our modern day,

1067
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,420
 we might say Johnson as the surname, son of John.

1068
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,980
 So this is something Moses means the son of,

1069
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,180
 the child of that person.

1070
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,100
 Here's the powerful thing.

1071
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,260
 She decides to just call him Moses

1072
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,500
 because she doesn't know who he's the son of.

1073
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,220
 This child's been abandoned.

1074
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,620
 She doesn't know that this mother that's been nursing him

1075
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,980
 has been the real mother.

1076
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,420
 She doesn't know where he comes from.

1077
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,340
 She doesn't know the prefix to his name,

1078
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,380
 but she's willing to call him Moses

1079
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,060
 'cause what she's saying, I think, to her father

1080
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,260
 and to everybody around her is that even though

1081
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:39,260
 we don't know who this is a child of, he is a child.

1082
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,500
 He is here.

1083
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,100
 He has been born.

1084
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,420
 He has value, intrinsic worth.

1085
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,580
 I am not abandoning this one.

1086
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,100
 I'm even gonna take this one into my own family

1087
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,780
 for he is a Moses, a child of, a son of somebody.

1088
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,020
 And I value that.

1089
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,900
 And so he is now mine.

1090
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,300
 Powerful, right?

1091
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,820
 That's right against her dad.

1092
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,860
 And that's her saying, this one has value.

1093
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,420
 But Moses, as he's writing this,

1094
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,900
 he uses the Hebrew form of his name, of course.

1095
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,980
 And let me tell you what Moses means in Hebrew.

1096
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,980
 Moses is Moshe in Hebrew, M-S-H-H,

1097
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,900
 which is there on the right-hand side.

1098
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,620
 You can see the Hebrew actually of it.

1099
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,500
 It literally means to be drawn out.

1100
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,580
 Now, there's two ways you can use the word Moses,

1101
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,980
 active, the one who draws out,

1102
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,940
 or passive, the one who was drawn out.

1103
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,220
 And Moses, as he's writing this,

1104
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,020
 he decides to use the active verb of his name,

1105
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,580
 which means the one who draws out.

1106
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,980
 Because what he's trying to communicate

1107
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,700
 is not just the heart that Pharaoh's daughter had to say,

1108
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,060
 even though I don't know the prefix,

1109
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,700
 I'm gonna say that this is a son of,

1110
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,020
 he's also then saying, I am the one who will draw out.

1111
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,060
 God called me to be the drawer-outerer.

1112
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,020
 I'm not just being drawn out.

1113
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,060
 So it's not the passive context, the one who was drawn out.

1114
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,580
 He says, I am the active word.

1115
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,380
 I am the one who draws out.

1116
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,220
 And he's saying that this is what God's about to do

1117
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,060
 in the rest of the story.

1118
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,900
 He's gonna use me to go back to Israel

1119
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,380
 to actually take them from their slavery and sin

1120
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,980
 and draw them into the promised land.

1121
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,020
 I am the one who will draw out.

1122
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,420
 And God stands over you and says,

1123
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,700
 I'm the one who draws out.

1124
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,060
 I'm the one who draws you out.

1125
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,300
 And I draw you out so I can draw you in.

1126
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,140
 I have drawn you out of the waters of death

1127
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,780
 and I have brought you into new life.

1128
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,180
 And this idea of drawing out and drawing in

1129
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,060
 is what all of the Exodus story

1130
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,580
 really essentially is about.

1131
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,060
 And in about two weeks time, I'm gonna show you

1132
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,260
 the power of what it is to be drawn out, to be drawn in.

1133
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,860
 But right here, right now, here's what God wants you to know.

1134
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,220
 You yourself are Moses.

1135
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:52,220
 You are a Moses in the Egyptian and Hebrew sense.

1136
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,340
 In the Egyptian sense, you are not abandoned.

1137
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,300
 You are not an orphan.

1138
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,500
 God looks down on you and says, this is my child.

1139
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,980
 This one has been created and it is good.

1140
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,540
 Some of you in this room, you don't think you're good.

1141
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,140
 And again, I'm not talking about some moral statement.

1142
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,940
 I'm talking about the purposes and promises of God

1143
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,260
 to create you and bring you in this world.

1144
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,800
 There is no one like you.

1145
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,580
 And God loves you so much that he sees you just as you are

1146
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,780
 and you are good and you are valued to him.

1147
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,740
 You are his son and his daughter.

1148
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,320
 You are his child and he welcomes you into his family.

1149
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,020
 And you are a Moses in the Hebrew sense.

1150
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,220
 You, if you're a Christian in this room watching online,

1151
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,100
 you have been drawn out of the waters of death

1152
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,580
 and you have been brought into new life

1153
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,280
 through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

1154
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,740
 He's forgiven your sin, removed it from you.

1155
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,300
 You've gone on your ark through your relationship with God

1156
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,740
 and you are now free to be who he has called you to be.

1157
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:51,940
 It's a beautiful thing.

1158
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,180
 But you are also a Moses in the sense

1159
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,660
 that your primary will, the primary will of God

1160
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,420
 over your life is that now having experienced salvation

1161
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,100
 and life yourself, having been taken from the waters

1162
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,760
 of death and brought into life itself,

1163
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,740
 you now are one who can Moses with others.

1164
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,160
 You now are one who can stand before the people

1165
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,100
 in your workplace, the people in your family,

1166
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,020
 the children that you have, whatever it might be,

1167
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,500
 and say, "These things will not be abandoned either

1168
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,220
 "and this will be something that I can partner with God

1169
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,140
 "to bring out of darkness into light."

1170
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,000
 That's Exodus.

1171
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,460
 That's the journey.

1172
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,180
 That's what you're invited into.

1173
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,780
 You are not abandoned.

1174
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,820
 You are a child of God.

1175
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,260
 He sees you and loves you.

1176
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,860
 And as you trust him and as you're willing

1177
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,820
 to release control of your life to him,

1178
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,680
 you will see a freedom and an Exodus in your life

1179
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,220
 like you've never seen before.

1180
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,860
 Can I pray for you?

1181
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,060
 Would you stand with me?

1182
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,880
 And as we stand together,

1183
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,220
 I wonder whether you close your eyes, open your hands.

1184
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,100
 I wanna minister now to you guys in the spirit

1185
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,800
 by reading a Psalm over you.

1186
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,960
 Thousands of years later,

1187
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,140
 or maybe about a thousand years later,

1188
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:16,100
 David writes a Psalm, Psalm 18,

1189
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,900
 and he pulls up this imagery of Moses

1190
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,340
 being drawn out of the water.

1191
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:24,380
 I wanna pray this over you.

1192
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,480
 It says this, "The Lord has reached down from on high

1193
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,860
 "and taken hold of me.

1194
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,840
 "He drew me out of the mighty waters.

1195
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,980
 "He has delivered me from a powerful enemy,

1196
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,200
 "from my foes who were too strong for me.

1197
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,420
 "For they confronted me in the day of my disaster,

1198
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,780
 "but the Lord was my support.

1199
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,200
 "For he brought me into a spacious place.

1200
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,360
 "He has delivered me because he's delighted in me."

1201
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,560
 Father, I thank you that you delight

1202
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,660
 in every person here and online right now.

1203
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:00,360
 And Father, you are at work with deliverance, Lord.

1204
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,960
 And Father, I pray that you would give us

1205
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,580
 the courage of this mother to let go,

1206
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:11,240
 the courage of this mother to release to you

1207
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,100
 everything in our lives,

1208
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,340
 trusting that you are a good father.

1209
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:21,760
 And Father, when we carry an orphan spirit in us,

1210
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,120
 it's such a thing that breaks us deeply.

1211
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,680
 And it causes us to be abandoned from the people around us.

1212
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,520
 I wonder whether you just take a moment to recognize

1213
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,180
 whether that's something that's a reality for you.

1214
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,440
 Do you feel abandoned?

1215
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,440
 Abandoned by God, abandoned by your family,

1216
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,080
 abandoned from people around you?

1217
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,680
 Do you feel looked over?

1218
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,000
 Do you feel like nobody values you?

1219
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,500
 Do you feel cast aside?

1220
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,120
 Do you feel like no one sees in you

1221
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,640
 what you see in yourself?

1222
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,340
 Do you feel like you don't have the worth

1223
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,560
 that others might have?

1224
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,440
 That's the work of abandonment in you,

1225
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,540
 to try to define you in any other way

1226
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,980
 than how God truly sees you.

1227
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,100
 Father, we come against the spirit of abandonment

1228
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,420
 over these people in the name of Jesus.

1229
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,380
 And Father, I wanna release

1230
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,180
 the spirit of adoption right now.

1231
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,820
 I pray, Lord, that every person in this room

1232
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:23,220
 would know that they are valued, created, a Moses.

1233
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,020
 That they are loved by you, a child of yours.

1234
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,580
 That they would know that they are a Moses,

1235
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:31,800
 drawn out of the dark waters into salvation and life.

1236
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,980
 And as we're just praying with our eyes closed,

1237
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,220
 I wanna just say this.

1238
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,920
 There's some of you in this room and your parents.

1239
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,900
 And I felt this strongly in the first service,

1240
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,900
 and I feel it strongly now.

1241
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,700
 Your parents over children.

1242
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,900
 And you're holding on too tightly to your children.

1243
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,580
 And your children are a gift from God,

1244
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,900
 a blessing from God.

1245
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,820
 But you're holding onto them too tightly.

1246
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:02,580
 And you're afraid.

1247
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:06,260
 You're afraid that they might feel abandoned.

1248
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,900
 But you're holding on so tightly, you're crushing them.

1249
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,900
 And the word of the Lord to you today,

1250
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,540
 he's saying, "Do you trust me with your kids?

1251
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,220
 "Do you trust me with your children?"

1252
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,540
 Because if you do, release them to me.

1253
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:25,580
 That doesn't mean you give up

1254
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:28,220
 all your responsibilities, of course.

1255
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,340
 But it means that you let go of control.

1256
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:34,220
 That you release that control over your children

1257
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,060
 to the Lord.

1258
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:39,620
 And some of you here believe that.

1259
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:44,300
 Believe that those children can't change.

1260
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,460
 And you're so frustrated.

1261
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:48,740
 And out of that frustration, you've been controlling.

1262
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,100
 God's saying, "Watch what I will do through my spirit in the heart of your child."

1263
00:54:52,100 --> 00:55:02,100
