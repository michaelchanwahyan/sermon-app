[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   Obedient to the glory of God that is seen in this moment and the glory of God that that envelops our city
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.940]   And the glory of God that is found in this world and we pray this in Jesus name
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.200]   everyone says
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.800]   Have a seat have a seat
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.640]   so so last year
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.240]   About probably I would say about halfway through
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.720]   The eight hundred and fifty kilometer walk that I was doing through the north of Spain during my sabbatical the Camino de Santiago
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.320]   Literally about halfway through that walk
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.760]   my phone died
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.420]   This actual phone this very very phone died on me and when I say died
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.140]   I'm not just saying like the battery ran out and like it lost reception or something
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.760]   I mean like total death without resurrection
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.560]   My phone went to hell
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.520]   It is totally and totally gone. I got the black screen of death never to revive itself
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.040]   I mean I tried everything I could to get it to come back to life
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.400]   But it was completely and utterly dead now that was an issue for many reasons
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.180]   It was an issue because this was how I was connecting with my wife and my daughter every day
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.240]   I was gonna be away for about five weeks as I did the Camino and
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.100]   This was my ability to stay in touch with my family
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.160]   I was off social media at the time, but this was my ability to stay in touch with the world
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.480]   So through the news and at night when I would watch YouTube
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.000]   Very important
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   this was the
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.160]   Connection point for my journaling and anytime God spoke to me. I would use my phone and write it down
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.880]   It was I was writing a book. I'm still writing a book. I've been writing a book for ten years
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.160]   I was still writing my book on this and every night on the Camino
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.240]   I would try to write a couple of paragraphs of my book all on my phone
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.840]   So when it died, that was a big issue
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.860]   But the biggest issue was that I was using this phone every single day and pretty much almost all day
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.380]   To navigate the route that I needed to take on the Camino itself
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.340]   So every single day I would use this as the map and all of us who are pilgrims on the Camino
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.240]   This is what we had. We didn't have a paper map. We had our phones and in these days, you know, there's a
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.360]   Specific Google map that you can download that has the Camino trail on it
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.420]   It has all the villages you're gonna go through it has all the hostels that you can stay at and there's literally like a blue dot
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.840]   Where you are on the Camino every time and so it's impossible to get lost
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.120]   You just open up the map on your phone. You follow the blue dot you follow the line that you're on and you're great
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.280]   They have occasionally
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.080]   Yellow markings yellow arrows painted on the side of buildings and stuff just in case but they are kind of few and far between
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.600]   You've got this map on your phone and that's what helps you. So here I am in the middle of this day
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.560]   I'm in the middle of nowhere in Spain. I don't speak the language. I'm struggling to understand the culture and
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.680]   No one is around me
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.060]   But all I have is my trusty phone and the map and I know I'm on the right path and as I'm walking that day
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.240]   it dies and
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.360]   It goes it like immediately gone
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.400]   Now here was the thing. I was kind of freaking out about I was like, oh my goodness
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.760]   What am I gonna do because like I can't navigate now, there's no one around me
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.200]   I was in the middle of nowhere
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.960]   There was no village that I could see sometimes the villages were like our little kind of stop point where you kind of know that
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.520]   If you get to that village, you're on the right path. Well, there's no village. There's no map. There's no nothing. There's no pilgrims. I
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.200]   Remember thinking okay. Well, I did look ahead a little bit and I know I had to turn right and I know there was a
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.440]   Bit around to the left and so I'm like, well, I'll just try to use my memory a little bit
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.720]   Maybe things will be okay
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.080]   So I start walking and and start trusting in my memory after I've made like two right turns and a left turn and another right
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.980]   Turn I realized that my memory has finished I can memorize a sermon word for word, but I cannot memorize a map
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:16.320]   So my memory completely failed and I had I had no memory now of where I needed to go still no one else around me
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.560]   And so I began to pray because that's what you're gonna do and I began to say Jesus
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.240]   Oh Jesus, if you could just help me here, I'm in the middle of nowhere. I don't know where to go
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.600]   I don't know where the next village is. I don't know
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.040]   I'm just gonna have to trust you Lord
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.560]   And I started to pray and I started to pray and I started to walk and pray walk and pray
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.740]   I'm like God if I'm not supposed to go right shut the door
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.720]   And I would go right but the door would still be open and I'd keep going right
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.600]   After about an hour. I've not come up to any village. I've not seen any other pilgrims
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.920]   But I'm trusting in the Jesus and the Holy Spirit
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.280]   So I walk another half hour an hour and a half no village
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.200]   No pilgrims my trust of Jesus is beginning to waver a little bit at this point
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.000]   I'm beginning to wonder whether I am actually on the right path. It feels like I'm
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.860]   Horrendously lost and suddenly I have this thought I wonder if anyone else has felt this way
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.280]   When you're in a situation where you've been trying on your own and it seems like all the doors are shut
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.240]   I had this thought maybe I should go back
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.320]   Maybe if I just turn around and go back to where I started
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   If I walk a hour and a half back in the other direction and try to retrace my steps as much as possible
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.840]   I will be at the place where my phone died because at least then I knew I was on the path
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.680]   So I'm literally I have walked for an hour and a half. I'm decided. Yes. I'm gonna turn around
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.520]   I turn around and start walking back where I had come as soon as I start walking back from where I'd come
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.520]   I noticed on the horizon
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.560]   somebody with a backpack
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.180]   Another pilgrim two thoughts went straight through my head number one. Maybe their phone has died too
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.400]   and
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   Maybe they're lost as well
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:10.160]   Or maybe their phones working and they're on the path and I'm not lost after all and so I'm starting to walk really fast
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.800]   I'm almost like running towards them there. It was this German lady that hadn't met her before
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.120]   She's kind of wondering why this pilgrim is running at her as I get kind of close to her
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.400]   She goes, why are you going in the wrong direction?
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.360]   And I'm like because my phone's broken and I got my phone out. I'm like look it's dead
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.840]   And she then pulls her phone out which is working and she goes. Well, we're actually on the right path
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.040]   She's like you're fine. Everything's gonna be fine
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.480]   In fact, and she just showed me like up just up over there a little bit left to the right up over that hill over there
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.240]   There's the village that you want to come to and when you get to that village
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.040]   There'll be some food and some water and I was like, oh, thank you Lord Jesus
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.480]   for this German lady and
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.880]   For the reality that I know that I'm now on the right path
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:00.860]   Well, I get to the village and I put my backpack down and I have a really nice lunch and I'm feeling a lot more
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.880]   Healthy and a lot more kind of sane and I get map from the lady
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.400]   She was gonna go off and walk on her own
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   but she gave me a
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.680]   Written down kind of map of where I needed to go and I had it on a piece of paper and I felt confident again
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.480]   And I managed to get to the village
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.280]   eventually where I was gonna stay that night and I managed to unpack my my backpack and have a shower at the hostel I was
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.360]   Staying in then straight after that. I began to just sit and as soon as I sat, you know
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.120]   You know, like sometimes you've got like so much activity going in your life that God can't speak to you
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.440]   Anyone else been like is it just me? Maybe it's just me. Sometimes we're like so busy, right?
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.200]   We're still doing stuff and it's only when we finally sit down that God's like great now
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.720]   I can speak and I kind of sat down and God began to speak
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:48.240]   And God began to speak to me in a very strong way in a very it was a very kind of Holy Spirit
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.120]   And I knew kind of like he was beginning to say some pretty serious things and I went to my pocket to get my phone
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.360]   Out so I could journal what he was saying and realize of course my phone's dead
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.160]   So so I grabbed a piece of paper and I began to write down what he said
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.240]   In fact, I grabbed this piece of paper right here
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.560]   this is the
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.320]   Very piece of paper that I I had and and before I show you what what I wrote you might remember
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.760]   During my sabbatical I had gone into my sabbatical asking God to speak to me about
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.360]   You know the vine and about us and our future and what God wants to do and what God wants to do me in the future
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.600]   And all that and God hadn't spoken to me at all throughout my whole sabbatical. That's all about the vine effect
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.120]   He'd spoken to me about all these other things which were for him much more important for me in that moment of my life
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.400]   But in this moment as soon as I sat down as he started to speak and the Holy Spirit came on me
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.480]   I knew he was speaking to me about us about the vine and
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.080]   It's the only time on the whole of my sabbatical where he downloaded something
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.360]   Specifically for us and I want to read to you what I wrote down. I wrote this
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.280]   He said I'm about to move the vine into uncharted territory. I
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.880]   Desire to take you places that you have never been to stretch you beyond what you are currently comfortable with
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:07.720]   These uncharted territories are necessary for your faith and my work. You do not have the strategy
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.920]   Resources gifts or wisdom for what is coming, but this is not an issue
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.880]   All you need to begin is faith and courage
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.240]   This is about complete trust in me what I will give you though is a burden
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.240]   I will give you a new heart. I will make you unsatisfied for the here and now
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:32.080]   I will place my hand upon you and stir up the joy of the pursuit of me not beautiful. I
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.920]   Want to read that?
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:47.120]   Sorry, um, I want to place my hand upon you and stir up the joy of the pursuit of me
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.040]   Hands up if you want the joy of pursuing Jesus
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.760]   I
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.040]   Am NOT calling you to a vision
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.320]   With knowledge of all that is ahead. No, this is uncharted territory
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.440]   what I am calling you is to value the value of complete and total surrender a
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:13.040]   Holy dissatisfaction in the way things have been and a passionate longing for the discovery of more
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.360]   I I then wrote at the bottom need to preach this sometime
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.520]   Ha ha ha that's what I'm gonna do now
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.360]   As God was downloading this to me
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.520]   It was very emotional at that time and very full and I felt the Spirit of God so strongly
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.680]   I I immediately began to see a picture in my mind not a not a vision with my eyes awake
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.200]   But just a picture in my mind as I I started to reflect and to soak in this word that got a given and it was
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:48.520]   A picture of one of those ancient kind of boats that were used by the early settlers the early pioneers the ones that were were going
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.960]   Out towards the discovery of new lands. I could see in my mind's eye this beautiful ship and
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.120]   And this ship was was in harbor in in kind of safe harbor
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:05.680]   But the ship was filled with people who were beginning to get ready for the journey that was ahead and and there were all these sailors
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.520]   On the ship and they were all doing their own individual tasks to prepare the boat for it getting ready
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.800]   the boat begins to move as the people begin to
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.920]   Navigate out of the safe harbor and out into the waters and at the bow of the boat in my mind's eye
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.120]   I could see the captain of the boat and he's standing at the front there with like a telescope and he's leaning forward and he's looking
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:33.160]   Out into the waters ahead and the sense was that everybody on this boat was excited and nervous at the same time
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.480]   They were excited because they were about to go on this great adventure
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:43.160]   They're about to be launched out and and they were wondering what might be out there and and they had prepared
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.880]   themselves for this and they all had their own little part to play and as they did their own little part the boat could move
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.720]   Out into what was unknown, but they were nervous because they didn't know what was out there
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:12:00.040]   They didn't know what was beyond this was uncharted territory. It was uncharted waters
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.760]   No one had been there before they didn't have a map
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.200]   The map was not
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.120]   Existing to enable them to navigate the place where they were going
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.320]   So the captain's leaning forward with his telescope and he's thinking to himself
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:19.600]   Well, either there's endless amounts of sea out there or we're gonna come across some land, but we have no idea
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.600]   What we do have is an undeniable
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.600]   hope
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.560]   We have an undeniable
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:31.960]   Burden inside of us that there is something out there to be discovered and not only that but we have this
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.680]   unrivaled passion
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   Unrivaled passion that although we're afraid and although we don't have the answers and although it's a little
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.720]   Uncomfortable and we might go out there and fail we might go out there and discover nothing
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:51.800]   But we're going to go and see what's there because I cannot deny the burden that is inside of me the undeniable
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.640]   Hope that is driving me and the unrivaled passion that is moving me
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.960]   and
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.660]   This picture so resonated with me
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.720]   Because I could get a sense that this is what God is calling the vine into in this the season that we're now moving into
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.240]   That this is our uncharted territory time
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.480]   This is our time where we are going to be in uncharted waters
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:23.120]   We've talked to you on vision Sunday over the last number of years about the river model that we have here at the vine
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.800]   The river model being this idea that church is not 90 minutes on a Sunday
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.280]   It's not people in a building the church is like a river
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.880]   Flowing in its city. We the people of Christ actively engaged in our sphere of influence
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.440]   We've been saying at the beginning of this year
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.360]   This is a year for action that we are to take our faith and live it more publicly
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.880]   So I'm standing here before you today on vision Sunday
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:51.160]   And I'm saying here's the thing that God is really saying in a year of action and wanting us to live our faith more publicly
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.160]   It's going to be uncharted
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.760]   There's not going to be a map
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:02.200]   We don't have the strategy the resources the wisdom to be able to conquer what is ahead in fact
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.280]   God has so designed it that our phone has died
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:13.120]   He doesn't want us to be relying on the old things that we've always relied on
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.920]   No, you see when God moves a church or a people into an uncharted time
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:24.040]   It's specifically to get them to focus off of what they were relying on that wasn't him and begin to focus
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.640]   directly on him
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:32.640]   Like me and that Camino going Jesus. I need you now because I have nothing else
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:38.080]   We believe that God is moving the vine now into a time where we
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.360]   Collectively as God's people are gonna have to say Lord if you don't show up
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.020]   We have no idea where to go
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:54.480]   And we're gonna be in a season where God is going to do some things that we have never experienced
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:59.040]   Before I believe we're gonna see this in an outpouring of his spirit here on Sundays
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.640]   But I believe we're also gonna see it happening in our cities in the corridors of power
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.480]   We're gonna see it in the marketplace. We're gonna see it in the educational institutions around us
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.240]   We're gonna see God do some things that we don't have a map currently for
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.960]   and
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.880]   The temptation for us is to try to go back to what we've done in the past to try to give us some
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:27.900]   Possibility when we're in an uncomfortable uncharted time and instead God is saying remember the captain on the boat
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:33.520]   What I want you to do is be leaning forward in the bow and yes, it can be uncomfortable
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.600]   And yes, it's going to be challenging, but I want you to look forward for I have put an undeniable
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.240]   Hope in you for the gospel for your city. I
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:49.920]   Love this because when God speaks to us as a church about the season we're in it's not just about us corporately
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.920]   It's also about you individually
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.840]   And if this is your home church in Hong Kong if you would say I'm a Viner
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.640]   I go to the vine every week or every other week or maybe once every ten months
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.040]   But if you say this is my church, I'm a Viner
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.240]   This is my community
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.160]   then this is not just something for us as a total church because you could sit there throughout this whole talk today and go like
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.440]   Oh, wow, God's calling the vine to be uncharted. Well, I'll look forward to each Sunday then and
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.040]   You'll miss the point
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.400]   Actually, what God's saying is I'm calling you to be uncharted
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:27.520]   I'm calling you into a season where you're not gonna have the strategy gifts wisdom and resource to be able to survive
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.600]   I'm actually gonna be
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:34.200]   Placing you in a time where you're gonna fill a little bit out of your depth a little bit overwhelmed where the things that you've relied
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.340]   On before are no longer gonna be the things that you can rely on now and I'm gonna do some things in your life
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.800]   And around your life where you're gonna be like, I can't believe the Holy Spirit is doing that
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.840]   You're gonna see fruit and abundance like you have never seen it before but there is no current
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:55.400]   Map, the phone has died and the phone has died because I'm shaking you out of a sense of complacency
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:01.880]   I'm shaking you out of how some of that dust is settled on you and I'm forcing you if you will I'm bringing you I'm
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.360]   Inviting you back to trust in me
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.120]   This is a
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.320]   It's not an easy thing. I think he's calling us to
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.240]   But let me give you some ideas of what I think this season's going to be like
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:22.900]   Is he I think like the settlers on the boat who who are both excited and nervous and pushing out from Harbor out to what?
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:30.260]   They don't know this is going to be a season of discovery and adventure focused on the unknown, but anticipated
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:35.240]   Let me unpack that for you for a moment the unknown, but anticipated
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.360]   It's unknown because that's the very definition of an uncharted season
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:45.000]   We don't know what's ahead and we know that God is saying that there isn't a current strategy
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.260]   We have that's gonna help us in what's ahead
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.520]   This was amazing when I was sitting there in
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.440]   Spain and God was downloading this to me and I was writing this down on that piece of paper
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.040]   I remember thinking to myself. This is awesome because I'm the senior pastor here
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.520]   I'm supposed to lead here and one of my responsibilities is always to have strategy for you and
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:09.000]   God was saying I'm taking you to a place where you won't have a strategy and I was like, thank you Lord
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.900]   So good because I don't know how many years it's been and my wife would tell you if she was here
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.900]   She would tell you that I have spent countless hours
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.720]   sleepless nights
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:23.980]   Worrying and processing and praying and discerning and having strategies and look I'm not saying strategies are wrong and bad
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.600]   They're not the vine has been blessed over so many years by the faithful
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:33.740]   stewardship of elders and pastors and senior pastors in past seasons and in my season as well
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:39.600]   We've been faithful to discerning a strategy for how to grow this church how to make sure the ministries are going
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.520]   Well how to serve our city strategies are great
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:49.600]   But could you imagine the lift from me when the Lord said I'm now moving into a place where you will not have a strategy
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.400]   That's uncomfortable Andrew
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:59.020]   But it's also a lifting of a burden from you because in that place all you'll need to do is point people to me
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:05.680]   And that's what I'm basically standing before you today to do is to say
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.760]   We don't have a new fresh vision and we don't have a list of things that the vines gonna do in the next 12 months
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.240]   All I'm saying to you is we are in uncharted times
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.080]   We have been pushed out of the boat
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.920]   We are out of our comfort zone and God is saying in that place
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.520]   You are gonna see me do more than you have ever seen me do before
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:33.080]   This is a time where it will be unknown for you. But notice what he says but
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:39.480]   Anticipated I love this. In other words just because it's unknown doesn't mean we should be passive towards it
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.520]   Follow this church because this is really important
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.080]   You know
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.840]   You could think that in a season of unchartedness where we don't have a map and we don't have a strategy and we must rely
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.440]   On Jesus that's all about Jesus. It's all about him doing it not about us and and so we could adopt a passiveness
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.760]   Towards what God is saying. That's not what he's saying. He's saying I want you in the bow of the boat
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:05.000]   I want you with that telescope looking out in hope that undeniable hope for the land that's ahead
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.840]   I want you leaning into what I'm doing
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.000]   I want you to realize it's unknown, but it doesn't mean you can't anticipate it
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.560]   It doesn't mean you can't believe that I'm gonna act
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.620]   It doesn't mean that you can't believe and trust that if you push yourself out there, I will be there
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:24.600]   It doesn't mean that you can't begin to believe and pray and hope for revival and refreshment
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.920]   And renewal in the city. I it'll be unknown for you, but it is something you can anticipate
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.840]   It makes sense to you
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.200]   So it's gonna be this kind of season
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:42.680]   Here's secondly what I think it is a little bit like me on the Camino and my my phone died and I I needed to
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   to find other ways to navigate
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.000]   this is going to be a season a
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.680]   Season where well, we're gonna have to have wholehearted trust and reliance in Jesus above above and beyond anything else
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:03.200]   What you got to understand is that an uncharted season to us is not an uncharted season to Jesus
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.720]   He knows everything that's ahead. He knows there's no land in this world that he's not explored
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:15.400]   There's no land in this world that he's not king and sovereign over and although it is uncharted for us
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.720]   Although we've never been there. He has been there. Not only has he been there. He is there
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.560]   Not only is he there he's sovereign over that place
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:31.720]   So our unchartedness is something that he is sovereign over and so what we need to do is shift away from the other
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.040]   Things we've been relying on and put our full trust in him
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.480]   Let me put it this way
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:45.180]   You have not been saved by Jesus Christ to be a map follower. You've been saved by Jesus to be a Christ follower
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.840]   come on church a
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:54.400]   Christ follower and that doesn't mean again that Christ doesn't help us and give us direction and give us guidance and all that sort of
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.700]   Thing of course he does but our primary posture has to be to follow him
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.480]   Recognizing that sometimes we end up following other things thinking it's him
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.320]   We end up following the things that are
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.560]   Comfortable for us or the things that we've relied on in the past or the strategies we've had before or the devotion that we did
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.560]   Two years ago that was super helpful for us, but we haven't done a devotion for two years
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.960]   And we begin to think that that if we just rely on the things that we've had before
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.800]   We'll be fine and God is basically saying in a season of unchartedness
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.840]   The whole point of it is that I'm bringing you to trust more in me
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:33.400]   That the old things need to be let go of and a fresh dedication to following me
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.720]   The phone has died vine
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.360]   Come on church
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.280]   The phone is dead
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:47.840]   The very thing that we've been relying on he's saying that's not going to happen. There's no strategy. No resources. No gift. No wisdom
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.420]   But there is me and as you stay tethered to me
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.000]   Sure, then the other things will flow the things you will need for this season
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.440]   It will come but your primary posture in this time is me
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.800]   Which is the third point of a season like this a little bit like the men and women that you see in the Bible who?
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:14.480]   Have at times have to re-examine themselves and recommit themselves to the ways of God
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.000]   This will be a season where God's people will have to have
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.840]   intentional readiness
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:28.680]   Intentional readiness through God where we're prepared not with a plan of action, but a posture of heart
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:34.800]   Come on church, not with a plan of action because if God had showed up and said, okay, this is what I'm doing
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.600]   I'm taking you here. I'm gonna do all these things
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.240]   We should have a plan of action for that
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.600]   But when he says you will not know what it is that I'm doing
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.000]   I am moving you out of your comfort zone into a place that you cannot predict
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.680]   But I am going to do some things our thing is not get a plan of action
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:55.600]   Our thing is let's make sure we're the people of God that we need to be so that when God does something that is uncharted
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.280]   We respond
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:05.160]   We react we follow we we begin to do we begin to work out the kingdom when we see the kingdom come
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:12.600]   And so this is a season not not a call to some strategic plan. It's a season of a call to actually
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.080]   reevaluating my heart
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.320]   reevaluating my life
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.480]   reevaluating the values that I hold inside of me
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:27.660]   Reevaluating the brokenness that's sitting within me the recognition that sin so easily tangles
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:34.300]   I want to be someone that when I'm in an uncharted season and God suddenly shows up and does something incredible
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.300]   I'm like God use me
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.520]   and
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:43.240]   For that to happen. I can prepare myself for that
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.840]   I may not know what it's going to be, but I want to say yes when it happens
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.760]   And so there's this posture of the heart
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:57.560]   There's a readiness of the values of my life so that when God moves I respond when God acts
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:03.200]   I do when he says who's gonna go I say send me when he says the harvest is plentiful
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.280]   But the workers are few I will say I'm one of the few
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.680]   And I think this is the culture that he's wanting to now build at the vine in the season that we're now moving into he's
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.680]   Intentionally shifted us into a hard
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:24.840]   Uncomfortable not having it all worked out time so that he can rebirth within us a passion
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.320]   for him
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.080]   Not beautiful that excites Emma
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.080]   And it excites me and I know it excites you too
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:40.160]   And these values that that we can have and posture for a season of being uncharted
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.960]   Is what we're gonna be talking to you about over the next six weeks starting next week and and the weeks beyond it
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.720]   We're gonna actually break down one of the values each week
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:54.320]   We're gonna do it by looking at the book of Acts and the beautiful story in Acts where where the first disciples go to take
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.720]   The gospel in the Greek or Roman Empire
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   I mean talk about uncharted times and
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:03.080]   The values that the disciples had to enable them to react and respond when God moved
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.680]   So we're gonna unpack that in the weeks ahead today, though
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:11.920]   I want I want to land us on a specific value a posture of heart that I think is the critical first step
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.000]   I think it's the thing that God is saying in a season of unchartedness
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.120]   This is the first thing that I call of you and actually when you look through the Gospels
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.520]   This was Jesus's first thing he called for everyone when he said like if you want to follow me
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:30.060]   He says I want you to lay down your cross lay down your life pick up your cross and follow me
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.780]   He calls them to what I would describe as
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.120]   sacrificial risk
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.840]   And I think if we're if we're being serious as a church about a season of being uncharted
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.480]   we have to be serious about the reality that it's gonna require a
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:50.640]   tremendous amount of sacrifice and risk for us to let go of the things that we've been
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.960]   Depending on and actually begin to look to Jesus again. We're gonna have to be all in
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.920]   in a time when we are feeling completely out of control and
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:10.720]   In that Jesus to the crowds to his disciples is constantly teaching them about the ability to move all in for him
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:16.360]   About giving up their lives to follow him. This is the crux of the gospel. It's a death and a resurrection
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:24.560]   It's a it's a giving in order to receiving its pull right into the church and current and saying I'm willing to take the dying
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:31.360]   Side so that the living side is seen in you. This is the beauty of the gospel and Jesus doesn't sugarcoat it
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:38.920]   And he says it's gonna require the giving of yourself the death to yourself the picking up the cross and following me
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:45.040]   Let me read to you just Matthew 13 beautiful chapter 8 parables in that chapter about Jesus
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:51.440]   Speaking about the kingdom and what his reign on earth is gonna look like but he narrows in on this idea of risk and
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:58.240]   The giving of all in these beautiful two parables. I want to read to you from Matthew 13 starting in verse 44
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:04.040]   Is this okay so far? All right, listen to this the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:11.120]   When a man found it he hid it again and then in his joy went and sold all that he had and bought that field
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:17.560]   Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls when he found one of great value
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:22.040]   He went away and sold everything he had and he brought it. I
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:29.520]   Love these two parables Jesus is bringing and he does this often. He's a master storyteller. He brings two different worlds together in two
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:34.880]   Contrasting but similar parables in the first he talks about a day laborer
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:42.520]   These were relatively poor people that kind of rented themselves out to the local farmers for each day of the year to to basically
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.560]   Farm their land and and in this particular parable
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:51.360]   He has this poor day laborer who's there with his hoe and he's kind of hoeing the ground if you will of the particular
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.680]   Farm that he's farming that day and suddenly he discovers a treasure
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:59.360]   Now when we read the parable and we see this we think well, this is just like a weird story, right?
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.160]   This is just a fiction story. But actually this happened all the time in the first century
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.680]   The land in that those years was so often
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:13.640]   Attacked by foreign forces and and there were no like HSBC deposit boxes security boxes in those days
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.360]   So what people did if they had valuables like jewelry or whatever?
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.000]   They would bury it often in one of their fields in the farm and they wouldn't tell anybody where it was buried
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.200]   Or maybe they would tell one person but more most likely they would just keep it to themselves
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:32.520]   But they would know exactly where they had buried this treasure. Now. The problem is maybe a year or two later
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:38.480]   They are conscripted into the war. They're killed on the battlefield and they didn't tell anybody where the treasure was
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:43.400]   So suddenly there's this treasure hidden in a field that's going to be hidden in that field for centuries
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:49.080]   Until someone finds it and Jesus is picking up on this exact thing. And here's this day with this day labor
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:56.640]   Randomly stumbles across this incredible treasure in a field and he understands that if he just pulls the treasure out
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   He can't claim it for himself
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.760]   Jewish law in those days was that anything above a field or below the field was
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.600]   Part of the ownership of the one who owned the field, right?
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:13.840]   so the only way he could own that treasure was by buying the field and then he could remove the treasure and take it and
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:19.120]   The parable pitches him doing exactly that but notice what it says. It says that he sells
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:25.320]   Everything in order to buy that field and notice this it says he did it with joy
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.680]   Come on church
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:35.000]   Because I know if it had been me and you had asked me to give a little bit I would have been very joyful
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   But you asked me to give it all
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.680]   Everything and in joy he went sold it all and brought the field
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:49.080]   The second parable is a world completely removed from the first but tells the same story in the second one
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:54.560]   It's a little bit more like Hong Kong. Here's a wealthy businessman. He's good at what he does. He's a pearl merchant
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.360]   He travels probably in the Persian Sea the Red Sea the Indian Sea
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   He probably works with pearl
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:06.020]   Fishermen in those areas and he's constantly on the lookout a little bit like the captain on the front of the bow
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:12.520]   Looking for that one pearl that is the pearl his holy grail if you will and here on this day
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.480]   He's been searching and looking and finally he discovers that one pearl a great price. And what does he do?
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:23.360]   He then sells all of his other stock in order to buy that one pearl
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:29.240]   Now this is incredible risk for both of these individuals and I want you to see something really important here
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:36.960]   Jesus is bringing a day laborer and a pearl a wealthy merchant together and saying this is not about whether you're poor or whether
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.080]   You're rich. It doesn't matter about your social economic status
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.280]   all people are required when it comes to the kingdom to give it all and
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:52.760]   So both of them give up everything in order to receive the one thing that is of great price and that was a risk
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:58.160]   It was risky for the poor guy to do all that. He didn't have a lot but he gathered it all together
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.640]   He sold it to buy the field
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:06.720]   It was risky for the businessman to give away everything or sell everything to buy the one there's this inherent
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.380]   Beautiful risk to it and Jesus is saying that's what my kingdom is like
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:18.560]   When you see the value of the kingdom, you're willing to give it all you're willing to risk what you have for what you don't have
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.120]   You're willing to risk what you know for what you don't know
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.120]   You're willing to risk who you are for who you long to become
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:31.920]   And Jesus is saying this is what my my my kingdom is like. This is what it's like when you are in
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.880]   Uncharted territory you're willing to sell it all
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.960]   So that the kingdom would be seen
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.040]   hmm, I
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.640]   Think there's so many things we could learn from these parables
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.740]   Let me just very briefly highlight a couple of things that I think are important
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:52.080]   The first is this when you're in a season of uncharted waters
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:58.200]   It's really important in that season you you ground yourself in the reality that you need to both
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:04.720]   Intentionally seek out the kingdom of God, but also be responsive to the unexpected activity of that kingdom
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.280]   You see in these two parables you see both at play in the first parable
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.680]   The the guy is just going about his normal day his normal business his mundane plowing the field
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.760]   He wasn't expecting to discover a treasure in that field that day
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.080]   but when he does he immediately is prepared through the posture of his heart to
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   Joyfully give it all for that and when we're in a season of unchartedness
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:31.600]   What God is saying is I need you to prepare your heart church because there are gonna be moments
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.360]   Ahead this year where I'm gonna randomly show up in your everyday
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:43.120]   Mundane life or your everyday work life or your everyday family life or your everyday
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.720]   Whatever and there are gonna be moments ahead where I'm gonna randomly show up
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:52.160]   You're gonna stumble on the kingdom of God in the gym in the boardroom in the classroom
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.480]   And the question is will you respond?
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.360]   Will you give it all
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:05.240]   Will you go this is a moment of the kingdom of God that I cannot deny and it's worth my everything for this
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:11.000]   That colleague in the workplace who doesn't believe in Jesus and has been a little bit hostile to the faith
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.480]   But shares that they're going through a divorce. Will you pray for them?
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.000]   That
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Person that you you met in the gym
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.920]   Who's who's going through a really hard time in life?
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:27.440]   Will you take them out for a coffee and share Jesus with them if you know that the Holy Spirit is at work?
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:34.400]   See, this is the kind of mentality the values the culture that he's trying to build here in the vine when he's calling us into
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.880]   Uncharted times we have to be willing to react to the
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.480]   Unexpected activity of the kingdom of God in our lives. What a joy that is
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:48.320]   But then equally we need to make sure we're intentional in searching it out
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:54.760]   We need to be standing at the bow with the telescope saying I'm not just gonna passively wait for Jesus to do it
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:00.420]   Oh, no, I want to be looking as well. I want to make sure that I'm going into my workplace on a Monday morning
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:07.220]   I'm in prayer saying Lord Jesus. Could you show me today who I could be praying for in my workplace Lord Jesus
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:13.160]   Would you give me an opportunity to share the gospel today Lord Jesus my mother who I've been trying to share my faith with
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.760]   For so long, but I will not give up we have to be intentional in
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.800]   Looking for the activity of the kingdom of God and when we see it
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.080]   Remember, we won't know what that specific activity is going to be
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:29.840]   But when we see it whether we stumble over it or we're intentional about it we respond
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:38.340]   We would not be able to stop the people trying to get into this building to worship with us on a Sunday if we were
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.340]   Living truly in uncharted times
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:47.380]   Because we would be so responsive to the work of the kingdom around us
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:51.560]   Risk is hard
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.300]   It's not a big deal to risk somebody else's life
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.920]   It's not a big deal to risk somebody else's resources
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.660]   But when you're called to risk your own
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.520]   When you're called to give of yourself
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:10.760]   That's when it gets difficult. That's when it's challenging and that's the second point here in the parable
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.960]   You see when you're in uncharted waters, you need to understand that you cannot live two lives
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:20.980]   You cannot live two lives. You can't have one foot in one life and one foot in another life
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.980]   You can't you can't expect to only give a little bit
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.520]   I love it because if Jesus had come up to the day laborer and said hey
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:32.040]   You just need to give a little bit just give a tenth of what you have and then you could have the whole field
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.080]   I think the day laborer would totally do that the merchant
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.920]   Oh, you just need to sell off a couple of pieces of your stock and then you'll be fine
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.800]   If I was to stand before you today and say hey vine
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:47.520]   We're in a season of unchartedness and you just need to give a little bit. I think all of you be like, let's go Andrew
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:53.040]   But if I stand before you and say we're in a season of uncharted and you need to give everything
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.500]   And by that I'm not talking finances
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:03.460]   I'm talking about your whole life your values your heart what you're committed to your goals your dedication your time
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:08.760]   And yes your resources giving it all for the kingdom of God. I wonder how many will respond
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.920]   But but I I have to present this in the way that Christ is bringing it to us
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:22.640]   You cannot have your current life and a better life at the same time at some point. You're gonna have to make a choice
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.640]   At some point we're gonna have to repent of some sin at some point
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:32.080]   We're gonna have to try to to receive the grace of God at some point
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.520]   We have to commit ourselves to the therapy at some point
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.120]   We're gonna ask some people to pray for us at some point
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:42.360]   We need to make a change because you cannot have your feet in two different camps and expect to be effective
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.200]   He's like in a season of unchartedness
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:50.880]   It's a hundred percent trust in me and you have to be fully in or you're fully out. There's no room for lukewarm
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:59.020]   There's no room for it doesn't work in the kingdom of God now that doesn't mean that there isn't a time for us
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.720]   It doesn't mean that like I need some time to get my life in order
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.440]   I'm I need a process of healing that will go through therapy of repair to time
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.140]   I need to take some time to repent of my sin that's gonna happen over time
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:15.240]   Of course time frames fine, but the question is where's the posture of your heart?
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.840]   The posture that's what Christ is looking for is all in
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:25.000]   Even though it might take some time for my life to to change and to get to where I want it to be my posture
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.560]   From the start is I want to give it all to Christ. I
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.280]   Want to serve him with everything. I
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:40.480]   Think he challenges us with this because he recognizes that that that risk is something that that isn't something we naturally do
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.080]   You know
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.800]   We often think that risk is like, you know
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:50.520]   Just random decision-making or like close my eyes and throwing a dart at a dartboard and hoping something sticks or but that's not biblical risk
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:58.160]   If I was to define biblical risk for you, I would put it this way biblical risk is this risk is intentionally costly decision-making
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.020]   driven by intentionally calculated faith
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.880]   And it's both of those things together
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:11.800]   Intentionally costly decision-making. This is gonna hurt me. This is not gonna be easy
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.160]   I'm being called to do something that is gonna be challenging for me
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.480]   I'm out of my comfort zone, but I'm trusting in Jesus and then intentionally calculated faith
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.120]   I'm not just giving up everything because the preacher told me to
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:29.200]   But I've actually sat with this I prayed about it. I've asked the Spirit to speak to me. I've looked at the scriptures
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:35.040]   I've had my prayer partners pray with me. I'm in my small group and we're working through this together and we've decided that yes
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.520]   The Holy Spirit is asking me to change my job to do this to do that
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.560]   And and we've come to a conclusion that this is what God is saying
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.960]   so therefore I'm gonna marry the activity of costly decision-making with the
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.800]   Calculated faith that I've been intentional about and I'm bringing those two things together
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:59.080]   When you do one of those things without the other if you're just making costly decision-making without faith, you're stupid
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   and
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:05.800]   If you are calculating your faith and not doing anything about it, you're a fool
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.160]   That's what the Bible says
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:15.320]   But it's when we bring the two of those things together that the kingdom of God does something in the city
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:21.200]   That's the beauty of this. I think he's shaking us up because yeah, there is some stuff that's sitting on us
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.080]   Maybe some apathy we need to shake up
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:28.360]   Maybe is there is some reliance on the old and God wants to shake that off so we rely on him again
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.560]   Maybe we've been Matt followers and not Christ followers
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:36.080]   There's a whole bunch of things but I think the main reason why Christ is calling us into the uncharted is because of Hong Kong
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:40.040]   It's because of this city. It's because of the people of this city
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:47.240]   It's because we should be the pearl merchants looking for the pearls of great price in the people that are around us all the time
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:52.680]   See every human being made in the image of God has a pearl of great price within them
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:58.520]   But sin covers it up sin tears it away sin blocks people from seeing it
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:05.280]   but when we begin to live and to share and sing the new song of the gospel to people when we begin to stand for
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.200]   the faith in
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.360]   radical new ways when we begin to love
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:14.080]   People and show people the grace and the kindness and the beauty of the kingdom of God when all of those things take place
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.960]   We begin to reveal the pearl that is a great price in every person
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.480]   And some come to the kingdom of God
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   What a beautiful thing that is
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.880]   I can't stand here telling you about risk today
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:34.560]   Without actually then doing something and living that out. It's really interesting as we've been
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.680]   Wrestling with this message with you here this morning
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.360]   We knew that God was calling us to do something very different on Vision Sunday
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:48.560]   Normally on Vision Sunday what we do is we actually invite you after the message to give to give financially to give
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:55.280]   Officially financially we always say above and beyond your normal ties and offerings and to give your finances
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.880]   Towards the vision that God has for us
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.720]   But as we were sitting as a church and we were wrestling with this as a leadership
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:06.040]   We're realizing that God was saying that's not what actually I want to ask of the people today
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.360]   And so we're actually going to be doing something that is intentionally
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:16.920]   Risky with you here this morning and by not asking you for financial giving today
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:23.840]   That actually puts the church at a bit of financial risk because normally Vision Sunday is a big offering that helps our church throughout the year
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:29.120]   But I cannot stand before you today and talk about taking intentional risk from
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:37.060]   Calculated faith and not be obedient by what God said. God said don't ask for giving on this particular day ask for living
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:43.980]   Ask for people to live the way that I'm calling them to live ask the people to have
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.760]   Values that I'm calling them to have values. That's what needs to be done today
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.360]   and look the reality is
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.760]   down the line in six months nine months ten months when we discover a treasure in the field or
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:01.920]   We see that pearl of great price and we know that the Holy Spirit is doing something amongst us in our ministries
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:09.440]   And we need to respond I will have no shame coming before you on one future Sunday and saying give let's sell everything
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.520]   And let's get the treasure in the field. Let's get the pearl of great price
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.440]   I will have no problem in the future coming before you and asking for your money
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.240]   But today
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.240]   That wouldn't be the right thing to do
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.280]   Today I want to unpack this and ask you for you
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.000]   Ask for your life
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.960]   ask for that
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:37.600]   Posture of heart that we've been talking about the preparation for what is ahead. I want you in that boat excited and nervous
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:43.880]   Playing your part ready to discover whatever it is. That's out there. The phone has died
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.840]   The way we do this is through consecration
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.440]   Consecration is this biblical idea that you can see we don't have time to go into it now
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:56.560]   But on Tuesday night, here's what I want to call you to on Tuesday night
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:02.680]   We're having a prayer night and it's happening here at 730 and the whole night is going to be an act of consecration
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:07.800]   And we're gonna lead you through a place of consecration on Tuesday night
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.200]   I want to encourage everyone in this church to come
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.240]   Which means that if you all did that's a big problem and it's a good problem to have
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:22.280]   But I want to call you to come because over that night we're going to consecrate ourselves to this new season
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:28.400]   And in order to prepare for that I'm gonna lead us in a moment in this just in a few seconds of
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:32.600]   Consecration here today, which is just a precursor of what we want to do in more detail on
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.120]   Tuesday night
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:41.680]   Consecration biblically defined is cleansing plus sacrifice plus devotion cleansing sacrifice
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:48.720]   Devotion and many times God calls his people to a place of consecration. I'm gonna read one scripture and then we're gonna pray
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.240]   Let me read this to you from
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.840]   from Joshua chapter 3
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.760]   Because I want you to hear how God calls his people into this
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:02.160]   Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan where they camped before crossing over
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:08.000]   after three days the officers went throughout the camp giving orders to the people when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.280]   God and the priests who are Levites carrying it you are to move out from your positions and follow it
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:17.920]   Then you will know which way to go. It's known as this since you have never been this way before there it is
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.240]   You are about to go into uncharted times
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:25.120]   God is telling Joshua and the Israelites you never been in the promised land before this is a land
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.320]   You have never set foot in before you have never been this way before
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.800]   Then you will know which way to go since you have never been this way before but keep a distance of about a thousand yards
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.040]   Between you and the Ark do not go near Joshua told the people here it is
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.120]   consecrate yourselves
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:46.440]   For tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you. I believe wholeheartedly that tomorrow
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:53.200]   however, that will be defined God is gonna do some amazing things amongst us it begins though in consecration a
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   Cleansing Lord, would you forgive me of my sin and wash me afresh with your blood a sacrifice Lord
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:05.880]   I'm willing to posture my heart so that when you act I'm willing to respond with everything a
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.080]   devotion a holy pursuit remember I said in that
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.040]   Download I wrote down on the piece of paper the joy of the pursuit of God
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:22.120]   the devotion the scripture reading the prayer the quiet times the small group commitment
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.040]   whatever it is the devotion the pursuit the positive pursuit of
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.800]   The presence of God as we cleanse and sacrifice and devote ourselves. We
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.400]   consecrate ourselves to a season of being uncharted and
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.720]   That's what I want to call us to now
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:41.280]   So I wonder whether you would do an important thing with me and this is if you feel this
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:46.360]   This is something for you to respond to it may not be possible for everybody because the chairs can be super tightly packed
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:51.000]   But the posture in the scriptures around consecration is a humble one. It's a posture being on the knees
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:58.060]   So I wonder as I pray for us on this vision Sunday as we dedicate ourselves to uncharted times ahead
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:01.000]   You would join me on your knees. Let's pray together
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:15.720]   As you get on your knees
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.480]   One of the things that we're going to do and I want you just to be in this posture of prayer
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:26.440]   In a moment, I'm gonna have our hosts pass out
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:32.880]   Communion elements to you and we're gonna take communion as a response today. But before that I want to pray for us
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:37.280]   So, let's just posture our hearts before him
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:42.600]   Father we thank you so much for this moment
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.800]   Lord, we don't take this lightly
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.080]   Lord your church on your knees before you it's a beautiful thing
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:56.800]   But I really thank you Lord that the phone has died I
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.640]   Thank you Lord that you've moved us out of our comfort zone I
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:08.000]   Thank you that you so love this city that you're calling your church to its knees
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.320]   To be consecrated before you
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:18.040]   So that like the day labor and the merchants we would joyfully give it all
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:22.360]   On behalf of what you're about to do. We don't know what you're gonna do
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:31.180]   We don't have the strategy the resources the gift of the wisdom, but what we do have is you
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:38.160]   And you believe that the cost of giving your life was enough that we were worth it
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.600]   And Lord as we are here on our knees before you it's our way of saying you are worth it
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:50.200]   Father I pray for every person here is going through difficult times
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:49:00.040]   Lord I want to pray that this year be a year of uncharted fruit and breakthrough
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:05.800]   Lord for those in this room who are struggling
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.420]   Lord I want to pray for uncharted peace
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:18.160]   Uncharted peace
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.080]   Lord most of all
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.880]   For all of us here who call the vine our home church
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:30.760]   Lord we humble ourselves on our knees and we ask for outrageous faith
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.920]   We ask for a faith that is way beyond what we currently hold
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.680]   We ask for the joy that was in that day laborer
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.240]   To give it all
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.240]   Lord we cleanse
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.000]   ourselves through the washing of your blood
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.640]   through the forgiveness of
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.400]   Your grace to the forgiveness of our sins
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:55.280]   Lord I want to pray your blood over every person in this room
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:02.320]   Lord there are sins that many of us carry some that deeply entangle. Lord we pray for freedom in the name of Jesus
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:08.080]   Lord we pray for the blood to cleanse your church to purify your bride
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:16.280]   Lord we pray for the sacrifices that are to come. Lord I want to pray that you would put a burden and an
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   unreasonable hope in each person in this room that they would give up their time and their energy and their
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:30.320]   Resource and their life and their decisions for your kingdom Lord Jesus. It'll look different for every single one of us
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:36.960]   Lord in our workplaces our education institutions our families our homes Lord would you move?
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:45.680]   Lord would you ask us a high price Lord and would your church be willing to give?
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:50.160]   And father we pray for devotion
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:57.840]   To be stirred. Lord I want to pray for a fire in the name of Jesus over every single person here
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:03.560]   For your word. I want to pray that your Bible would come alive in the hearts of our church like never before
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.160]   Lord I want to pray that people would be hungry to read the scriptures
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:13.360]   Those of us myself included at times that fall asleep when we read the scriptures. Would you keep us awake Lord?
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.680]   Would you bring your word alive? Would you speak Lord?
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:23.440]   Would we be like the disciples on the road to Damascus who would honor you by saying we're not our hearts burning within us
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:30.320]   When you open the scriptures to us Lord would prayer be released over the divine church in the name of Jesus Lord
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:36.640]   Would we find ourselves on our knees praying for one another praying for our city praying for the loss
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:40.040]   Praying for revival Lord would you break us Lord?
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:45.000]   Lord would devotion be here in the name of Jesus
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.840]   Lord we consecrate ourselves
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:57.000]   So in this posture of consecration, I'm gonna invite the host just to come and they're gonna pass out the bread
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.880]   They're gonna pass out the cup and they're gonna pass out both of those things at the same time
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.440]   I want you to just take in your hand
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:09.120]   And don't don't allow the elements to break
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:15.480]   Where you are in prayer right now, but just receive them keep them in your hand both the cup and the bread
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.960]   We're gonna share them all together as one church in a moment
