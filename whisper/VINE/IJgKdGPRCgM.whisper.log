[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Happy Chinese New Year, everyone.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.640]   So I hope you all had some good time over the past few days,
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.440]   perhaps enjoying some good food, enjoying some time
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.600]   with your family and friends.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.960]   If you say, oh, I don't really celebrate Chinese New Year,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.120]   I hope you enjoy some time off during the public holiday
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.320]   as well.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.400]   So my name is Jennifer.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.160]   I grew up in Hong Kong.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.400]   And my family is quite a traditional Chinese one.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.480]   So Chinese New Year has always been a big thing
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.320]   that we celebrate, especially when I was a kid.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.720]   So there are a lot of things that we do as a family.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.920]   We need to clean our house.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.280]   We go visit our families.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.200]   We buy new clothes.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.360]   And we will host dinners at our place as well.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.600]   So it's been a lot that we do in the new year.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.680]   But the intention behind the whole thing
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.400]   is really we hope to start our year well.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.440]   So among all the things, there's one thing
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.520]   that I would like to highlight to you today
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.000]   is during Chinese New Year, we will say some blessings
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.520]   to each other.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.960]   So for example, my family has been teaching me
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.080]   that each family can be different.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.200]   But my family has been teaching me
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.880]   that the very first thing I say to a person
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.480]   if this is my first time seeing them in a new year
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.640]   is a blessing.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.760]   So in case, like, for example, Gordon,
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.320]   this is our first time meeting in a new year.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.720]   So I supposed to say a blessing over him,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.880]   something like [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] or [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.760]   things like that.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.760]   The very first thing I say to him should be a blessing.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.240]   So let me introduce a few blessings
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.960]   that are commonly used among the Chinese community
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.880]   in Hong Kong.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.080]   So the very first one I think many of you
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.280]   will be heard of this is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.520]   It means wish you get rich.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.640]   And then the second one is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.680]   is wish you good health.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.480]   Sounds good, right?
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.720]   And then the third one is an interesting one
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.960]   that I would like to teach you is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.000]   Doing good.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.480]   And the literal translation is I wish
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.120]   your heart desires come true.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.760]   Sounds really good, right?
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.360]   Sometimes I really hope things happen that way,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.880]   that my heart desires will come true.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.280]   And yes, I said the whole idea behind this
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.200]   is to start our year well.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.800]   And there's also a belief behind that.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.920]   If we do these things, it will bring us good luck
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.480]   throughout the whole year.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.760]   So my family is not a Christian one.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.920]   So they really take this tradition very seriously.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.080]   So growing up, the very first thing
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.040]   I need to do on a New Year day before even brushing my teeth
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.240]   is to go to my parents' bedroom and say at least three
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.760]   blessings to each of them.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.840]   If I pass the exam, I will get my license from them.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.320]   So that's how it works.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.000]   And also, my parents would always
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.880]   make sure I say the right thing to the right people,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.000]   especially when they're around me.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.720]   So for example, if I'm seeing an older person,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.560]   I must say I wish you good health.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.520]   If I'm seeing a business person, I must say I wish you get rich.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.520]   So this is how serious it is for my family.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.680]   It sounds like an oral exam, I know.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.120]   But sometimes I feel like it as well.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.880]   And so slowly, this whole tradition--
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.640]   because I have to do this every year.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.680]   My parents will make me say something
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.680]   to them and to other people.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.600]   And it has become a formula to me in my head.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.320]   So whenever I see a person, my brain
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.800]   will automatically go search the right word I should
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.000]   say to them in a new year.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.840]   But do these words run through my heart?
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   Do I really bless them wholeheartedly?
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.480]   Maybe not.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.520]   I almost feel like I'm just doing it for doing's sake.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.560]   I do it because this is what a Chinese does during CNY.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.240]   And how about you?
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.480]   If you are Chinese in this room, perhaps you
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.120]   can resonate this with me as well.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.400]   Perhaps you also find yourself just blessing one another out
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.360]   of the ritual or tradition.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   It feels like we are doing things out of habit.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.480]   And I hope I'm not lonely in this room feeling that way.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.920]   And perhaps for those who are not Chinese in this room,
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.880]   you might not 100% understand what I was saying.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.320]   But actually, there are things we Christians
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.280]   say to each other as well.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.440]   Let me give you some example.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.880]   God bless you.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.240]   Or I'll pray for you.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.280]   Or-- I hear some laugh already.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.880]   Let's catch up some time.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.080]   How about this?
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.960]   Or I would like to involve more and serve more.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.600]   Do they sound familiar?
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.040]   Yeah, these are the things that we say to each other as well.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.280]   But are we saying from the bottom of our hearts?
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.320]   Do we always mean it?
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.120]   Or do we always back our words with our actions?
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.520]   Last week, Pastor Promise shared with us
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.840]   that Jonathan said he loved David as himself.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.520]   And Jonathan backed these words up with his whole life,
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.800]   actually.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.400]   So for us as well, it is important to back our words
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.800]   with actions.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.880]   And right now, we are still at the beginning of the year.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.640]   Do any of us have the New Year resolution
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.280]   of spending more time with God, or spending more time to pray,
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.880]   or spending more time to read the Bible?
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.200]   I'm one of them.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.920]   So how is it going?
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.400]   I need to confess that.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.440]   I say these things every year at the beginning of the year.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.560]   But when my schedule gets full, the first thing I sacrifice
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.160]   is spending time with God too.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.200]   And of course, personally, I want to spend more time
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.840]   with God.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.080]   And I'm sure all of us in this room
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.440]   would want to be closer to God as well.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.080]   We want to be more like Jesus.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.160]   We want to make Him pleased with all the things we do.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.920]   But why do we stop at wanting to do something,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.320]   but not making it happen?
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.520]   Why do we say we are going to do something,
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.280]   but not following through with it?
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.400]   So to be honest, our faith does not
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.080]   work like the Chinese New Year blessing, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.520]   "May your heart's desire come true."
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.680]   Our heart's desire do not just come true automatically.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.840]   And we always need to do something and make them happen.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.800]   In the year of 2025, as a church,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.760]   we have a theme of action.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.680]   I think many of us are very excited to do something
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.800]   together.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.920]   It is really essential to allow our action
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.520]   to align with our heart's desire, and more importantly,
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.880]   to align with our faith.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.680]   We don't want to do something together just for doing's sake,
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.960]   or the other way around, that we want to do something,
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:59.680]   but we stop at just wanting or saying, and end up not doing it.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.720]   So it is amazing that there's a whole book in the Bible that
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.360]   tells us about moving our faith into action.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.960]   As we read it, we might find his theology
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.160]   a little bit different from Paul's,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.280]   saved by faith along theology, as he argues the importance
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.320]   of action coming with our faith.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.000]   But if we look into it deeper, we
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.080]   will find it makes sense, because he
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.360]   asks practical application to Paul's theology.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.480]   And this book is written by the apostle James,
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.120]   and therefore the book is called the Book of James.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.400]   We will look into a few verses in chapter 2 today.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.760]   And let me read it for you.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.520]   "What good is it, my brothers and sisters,
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.240]   if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.400]   Can such faith save them?
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.000]   Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.840]   If one of you says to them, go in peace, keep warm,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.720]   and well fed, but does nothing about their physical needs,
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.520]   what good is it?
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.120]   In the same way, faith by itself,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.560]   if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.640]   But someone will say, you have faith, I have deeds.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.600]   Show me your faith without deeds,
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.480]   and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.520]   You believe that there is one God.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.120]   Good, even the demons believe that and shudder.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.880]   You foolish person, do you want evidence
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.880]   that faith without deeds is useless?
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.960]   Was not our father Abraham considered righteous
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.440]   for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.360]   You see that his faith and his actions were working together,
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.840]   and his faith was made complete by what he did.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.280]   And the scripture was fulfilled that says,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.640]   Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.840]   and he was called God's friend.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.520]   You see that a person is considered righteous
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.840]   by what they do and not by faith alone.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.560]   In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.040]   considered righteous for what she did
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.000]   when she gave lodging to the spies
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.480]   and sent them off in a different direction?
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.520]   As the body without the spirit is dead,
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.560]   so faith without deeds is dead.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.800]   So here, James is clarifying what a true faith is,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.720]   what it means to be a Christian.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.400]   James asked us a question,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.560]   what good is faith without deeds?
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.400]   In other words, what good is faith without action?
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.600]   Is faith only about believing there's one God
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.920]   who is Jesus Christ?
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.440]   Let's ask ourselves this question for a moment.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:59.800]   Is our faith authentic faith if we never reach to a point of action?
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.120]   We can imagine if the apostles who had faith,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.120]   but they never reached to a point of action,
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.600]   I think the church today would not have existed.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.640]   And as Jesus called the disciples,
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.880]   he did not just call them to believe that he is the son of God.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.560]   In fact, Jesus called the disciples to follow,
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.120]   and following is an action.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.880]   Some of you might start thinking,
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.000]   didn't Jesus and the apostle Paul emphasize that
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.440]   we are saved by faith and grace instead of following the law?
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.680]   That is very true that we are saved by grace of God alone.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.360]   And in fact, we can never save ourselves by doing anything.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.440]   The deeds James is referring here isn't the deeds of the law,
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.880]   but the deeds as a demonstration of our faith outwardly.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.360]   It might sound similar or it might look the same
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.880]   because we can be doing the same thing,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.360]   but internally it could be very different.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.880]   Let me give you a simple example.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.080]   So let's talk about praying before a meal.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.880]   So I grew up with a teaching that if I am a real Christian,
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.160]   I must pray before every meal.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.800]   And it doesn't matter whom I'm eating with.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.000]   It doesn't matter whether or not they are Christians,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.680]   but my prayer needs to be visible
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.240]   to the people I'm eating with.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.000]   I can be praying silently,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.040]   but I need to show that I'm praying
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.880]   and show that I'm a Christian.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.400]   So if we think about this,
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.320]   it sounds like the works of the law, right?
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.120]   Because it operates like this,
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.840]   because we are a Christian,
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.840]   therefore we need to pray before every meal
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.280]   to show that I'm a Christian.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.160]   But while there are other people who prays before every meal
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.600]   because they believe that,
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.080]   we believe that everything is provided by God,
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.120]   every meal is provided by God.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.520]   So we want to give him thanks before every meal.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.320]   And it is totally different from the motive.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.840]   Like it is an outworking action from what we believe.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   So these two things, these two examples,
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.720]   they can look exactly the same.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.960]   We are like, they're all praying before a meal,
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.640]   but they actually come from very different motives.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.160]   And therefore they can have very different results.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.200]   And I want us to pay attention to how James understands
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.400]   the relationship of faith and deeds.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.600]   In verse 14, he says,
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.960]   "What good is it if someone claims to have faith,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   "but has no deeds?"
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.520]   Let's pay attention here.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.800]   James didn't say,
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   "What good is it if someone has faith, but has no deeds?"
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.160]   He said, "Someone who claims to have faith."
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.700]   In other words, James is referring to someone
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.680]   who says they have faith,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.600]   but never reached to a point of action.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.160]   And these people, they are deceiving themselves.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.440]   And the faith is just a self-declaration.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.160]   But again, James is not introducing
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.400]   some new salvation formula
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.160]   that is different from Jesus' teaching.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.560]   He's not telling us that faith plus action
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.780]   equals to salvation.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.040]   It's not like now we have faith in Jesus
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.160]   and we add a little bit of action in there,
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.320]   then that's salvation.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.880]   He is telling us that faith by its own nature
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.160]   includes action.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.120]   In other words, action is the result of our faith.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.120]   We desire to do something for God
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.440]   because we have been given a new hope,
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.180]   a new life, a new identity.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.480]   And out of the faith and salvation,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.620]   we have received from God,
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.660]   we put that salvation into practice.
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.840]   It doesn't add to our salvation,
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.400]   it is an outworking of our salvation.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.820]   So action is the natural result of our faith.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.320]   So we can't have faith but do nothing about it.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.880]   And James used Abraham as an example,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.120]   that Abraham has faith,
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.640]   but he also had deeds that originated in his faith.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:38.080]   And because of his actions that followed from his faith,
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.600]   God declared him as righteous.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:46.760]   Faith is like a seed planted inside each one of us,
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.400]   and our words and our actions are the fruits of our faith.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.960]   In fact, we are all different
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.800]   and our action can look very differently.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.560]   And most of us here in this room,
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.760]   I'm sure you're not called to sacrifice your son, right?
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.600]   Right, Alison?
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.640]   [audience laughing]
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.440]   But there is one thing that is applicable
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.560]   to all of us today is like,
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.520]   there is a cost in following Jesus.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.880]   It means putting our faith into action,
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.920]   it means following God's call and do something.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.420]   And it could look differently to each of us.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:32.400]   So I would like to ask, how is God calling you to act?
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.560]   Is there anything God is conflicting you to do for him
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.680]   in the coming year?
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.800]   One more thing I would like to highlight in this passage
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   is that James concerns our faith in relation to others.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.680]   He gave us a scenario in verses 15 to 16
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.400]   that if a person who has no clothes, no daily food,
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.960]   and he came to us, but if we say to them,
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.360]   "Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.680]   "but do nothing about their physical needs."
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.380]   How do we feel about this?
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.320]   It sounds terrible, right?
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.800]   But if we are honest,
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.540]   sometimes we Christians do this as well.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.840]   When we see people in need, we might say,
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.680]   "God bless you," or "I'll pray for you."
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.080]   Praying is great and blessing people is wonderful as well,
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.640]   it's powerful.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.980]   We need to continue to do this to people.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:38.980]   But let's be reminded that our faith cannot stop
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.160]   at saying something nice to each other,
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.360]   but not doing anything about it.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.400]   James says, "Such faith is dead."
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.280]   Let's do better than this.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.540]   So what does living faith mean?
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.440]   If we read the rest of the book of James,
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.640]   which is heavily on the topic of faith and deeds,
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.520]   he says a lot about our relationship with others.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.000]   He speaks again favoritism,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.200]   he says about caring for the poor.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.840]   Again, this is not some laws for us to follow,
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.400]   but our faith conflicts us to showcase the love of God
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.360]   to people around us.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.320]   This is who God is.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.320]   This is a God who loves and cares for people,
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.560]   not just saying it, but through our action.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.400]   And sometimes it will mean meeting people's physical needs.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.460]   I'm not saying that we need to meet everyone's need
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.480]   when they come all the time,
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.400]   but sometimes it does mean that we need
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.980]   to meet physical needs of people.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.720]   And more importantly,
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.640]   God called us to be part of his action.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.520]   He called us to be more like him.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.640]   And through our actions,
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.640]   we are demonstrating who God is to the people around us.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.340]   It is always about people.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.460]   God does not just intend us to be isolated
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.740]   and to be close to him only.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.080]   God always intend us to follow our faith
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.900]   to shape us in how we are interacting with people.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:27.260]   This is also what Jesus commanded us, to love one another.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.800]   As we are actioning, it is important to keep in mind
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.880]   that we are not just doing something good
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.460]   in the public's eyes,
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.640]   but we are actually doing the work of God
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.720]   as the followers of Jesus.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.680]   As the love of God is in us,
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.280]   and we are to reflect who God is
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.760]   and bring the love of God to the world.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.680]   This might sound very big and scary,
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.760]   but loving people can be really reflected
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.800]   in the smallest ways on a personal level.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.920]   It is really a way of living.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.520]   So how do we do this?
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.880]   How do we practically put James' call into action
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.140]   in the city of Hong Kong?
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.800]   In a relationship that we had around us?
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.440]   How do we ensure we're not just saying words,
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.140]   but putting our faith into action?
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.920]   Let me give you a few examples
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.680]   to help you to think about this,
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.560]   and then you can think about how you can apply it
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.360]   into your own life.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.680]   So in today's culture, people tend to put ourselves first,
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.620]   especially in Hong Kong.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.920]   We value efficiency and convenience.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.000]   We can't waste one minute on anything, really.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.680]   If we get to the train station,
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.200]   if we see the next train is in three minutes,
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.880]   it's too long, right?
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:51.520]   And you can tell how efficient we are
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.720]   by how we walk on the street,
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.280]   by how we drive on the road, right?
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.440]   So Hong Kong people do not really value
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.540]   being considerate, to be honest.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.400]   So, (laughs)
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   so what does following Jesus in this space look like?
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.360]   How can we be considerate to people
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.600]   as we are living in this environment?
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.520]   And also, with our friends as well,
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.880]   we always say to each other,
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.280]   "Let's catch up more, let's hang out,"
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.760]   but do we always put that in our schedule
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.060]   and make time for that?
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.400]   Or we put it in our schedule,
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.800]   it makes it to my schedule,
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.720]   but I don't feel like it on the day,
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.600]   so what do I do?
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.240]   These things sound familiar, right?
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.960]   So what does loving people mean in this space as well?
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.140]   And I think being consistent and honoring people's time
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.480]   is one way to do it.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.760]   And our faith does not only exist for the big moments,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.260]   the turning points in our life.
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:03.200]   Our faith is also reflected in these smallest things
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.680]   in our everyday life, how we treat people,
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.520]   how we make choices, how we choose
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.760]   to put other people's needs above ourselves.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:18.840]   Where do we choose to sit or stand in a public transport
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.940]   or on a Sunday, or in what condition
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.680]   we are leaving the bathroom to the next person
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.680]   is one way to reflect it.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.680]   These smallest things in our life,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.440]   have we thought about what kind of faith
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.040]   are we demonstrating or what do we want to demonstrate?
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   How is your faith conflicting you
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.300]   on how to interact with people?
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:49.160]   Is your faith conflicting you to do something
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.640]   for the people in need?
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:57.120]   Let me share my story of how God conflicted me personally
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.120]   to put my faith into action when I was in seminary.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.120]   So I started studying in seminary
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.860]   before I actually started working in ministry.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.680]   I was working in corporate, I was thinking about ministry,
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.680]   so I started a part-time program in a seminary.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.620]   And then later I joined the staff team at the Fine,
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.120]   so I've started working here also as a full-time staff.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.380]   So in my seminary life, I have always been
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.420]   a part-time student with a full-time job.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.240]   As you can imagine, I need to be quite diligent
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.400]   with how I use my time.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.180]   I need to set good boundaries at work
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:45.120]   so I can get off on time and show in school in person.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.020]   And yes, my school requires me to go in person all the time.
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:53.320]   And then also to make time to do my coursework as well,
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.000]   to write assignments, write the papers.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.520]   So my time being in school campus
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.420]   has always been very functional.
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.500]   When I show up in school, I was either in class
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.460]   or either I'm hiding in library doing my research
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.740]   and doing my homework.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.620]   By the way, I love working in library.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.600]   It's quiet, it has a lot of books and resources,
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.580]   and I can be quiet processing the thoughts in my mind.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.420]   So I really love that.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.880]   However, one big belief of my school
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.860]   is that we are a learning community.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.380]   And community plays a big part in our learning
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.300]   and equipping process, which I really appreciate now,
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.100]   not so much back then.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.020]   So whenever my school has some optional events,
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.780]   like show-show events, I had a very easy excuse
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.080]   that I say all the time.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.440]   I'm just a part-time student,
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.140]   I can't commit to anything else.
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:57.800]   So my school was very gracious to part-time students like me
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.240]   and I held on to my excuse for a few years.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.740]   In my first few years, I was really happy with my patent,
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.680]   but until I started working here in ministry,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.600]   I started to feel that my study patent doesn't seem right.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.920]   It feels like I'm just there
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.260]   to fulfill the course requirement and to just get a degree.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:21.280]   Although if I was still able to learn something new,
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.680]   that was not enough.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.100]   So I realized my patent does not allow me
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:32.100]   to fulfill what I was sensing God is calling me to do.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.280]   Something needs to change.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.940]   If I also believe that community plays a part
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.220]   in my learning and equipping process,
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.620]   I can't be just showing up to the class
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.500]   and then hiding in the library all the time.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.340]   If I also believe that community
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.420]   is an expression of my faith,
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.140]   if I believe that Jesus is calling me
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.540]   to learn with those people,
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.020]   I need to actually spend time with them.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.520]   And my next steps is to actually doing it.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.460]   I can't be saying to my schoolmates
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.420]   that I want to get more involved
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.700]   and spend more time with you,
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.540]   but not doing anything about it.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:20.300]   I needed to sort out my priorities.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.700]   It doesn't mean that I don't care
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.220]   about my work here or my study anymore.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:30.320]   Those two things still have higher priority in my life,
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.780]   but I needed to prioritize my schoolmates,
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.020]   perhaps over my excuses at the moments
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.680]   that I don't feel like it.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.940]   And I need to prioritize people over my comfort zone,
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.020]   which is the library.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.980]   I needed to change my patent,
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.740]   which means showing up to the common area
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.860]   instead of the library,
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.940]   make time to talk to people,
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.100]   enjoying their social events.
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.920]   And I needed to drop my excuses
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.220]   and walk out of my comfort zone.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.980]   Was I stretched?
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:07.880]   Absolutely.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.260]   Does it worth it?
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.180]   Even so.
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:16.700]   So I wonder if you're holding on to any excuses
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.860]   and allowing those to stop you
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.740]   from doing what God is calling you to do.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:27.020]   As I shared at the beginning,
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.760]   during CNY, we often say things to people out of habit
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.300]   or rituals, but not really meaning it.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.040]   We can't go forward as Christians here,
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.140]   especially in a year of action in 2025
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.680]   with the same attitude.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.280]   We must check our hearts and ask ourselves,
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.300]   where our motives are coming from.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.620]   This is step number one.
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.860]   But we can't stop here.
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.820]   We can't just follow with our mouths only.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.820]   We must put our faith into action.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.380]   In order to do that,
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.260]   we will look into some practical ways
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.340]   we can put our faith into actions.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.020]   So the first one is to seek God.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.900]   As I said just now,
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:18.140]   checking our hearts and motive is step one.
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.200]   Before we take any actions,
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   we need to be intentional about
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   to allow God speak to us on what and how to act.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.840]   Just like what the apostles did.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.600]   Like I said, it doesn't have to be big things all the time.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.920]   We can ask God each day how we can demonstrate our faith
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.760]   and his love before we go about our day,
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.120]   before we go to work, before we go to school,
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.320]   when we wake up in the morning or on our way.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.160]   We can ask God about that.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.240]   And also if you have important things during the day,
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.680]   do that before your important meetings.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.280]   Ask God how would he want you to act.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:08.480]   And then number two is we need to watch our choices.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.760]   As we go about our day,
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.840]   there are a lot of things we do out of habits.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.520]   Like getting on trains, going to work,
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.260]   going out for lunch, doing our groceries.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.000]   We might not pay attention to these moments,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.160]   but there are actually a lot of human interactions
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.040]   in those spaces and we make a lot of choices out of habit.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.360]   So perhaps we can be intentional about our choices
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.960]   and ask ourselves,
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.640]   are we choosing to be considerate to people?
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.840]   Are we choosing to demonstrate love
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.800]   to people with our choices?
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.720]   And number three, it is our priorities.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.840]   Let's be honest, we all have limited time and resources.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.800]   As we look at our schedule, ask ourselves,
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.200]   what are our top priorities
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.280]   that we must give our attention to?
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.920]   And what are the things that are occupying us
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.860]   from doing the important things?
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.120]   And are there any excuses we are holding onto,
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.020]   like what I did in seminary?
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:19.000]   If there is something that God is convicting us to do,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   we need to make time for that
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.820]   and make them one of our priorities.
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:28.340]   And the final one is to honor our promises.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:32.800]   If we say to God or we say to each other
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.840]   that we will do something, let's honor that.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.520]   If you are bad at this, perhaps put it in your diaries
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.660]   or setting an alarm or reminder,
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.280]   or perhaps ask someone who is close to you
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.040]   to keep you on track and hold you accountable.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.820]   Just find a way that is workable for you.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:59.420]   And let's approach 2025 together
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:04.080]   with putting our words into action and live out our faith.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.600]   If we want to spend more time to read the Bible,
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.920]   open the Bible and read it.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.760]   I can't think of anything else
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.800]   that other way that we can do it.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.920]   If you want to spend more time to pray,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.360]   take away your phone or other distractions and pray.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.760]   This is the only way to do it.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.600]   If you want to serve the people around you,
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.760]   make sure you commit yourself to prioritize this
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.280]   so you don't make people down.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.300]   And I hope in 2025, we will be a community
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:41.300]   that allow our faith to shape us inwardly and outwardly.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.460]   And also as a community,
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.020]   as we are entering into a year of action,
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:53.020]   if you also believe that action is part of our faith,
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.020]   get ourself ready to be part of the action.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.980]   Not because everyone else is doing it,
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.680]   not just doing it for doing's sake,
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.800]   but let's demonstrate our faith as a church.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.420]   So I hope this is encouraging,
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.380]   this excites you to do something for God.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:17.400]   As I said, it could look very differently to each one of us
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.880]   because we are all unique
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.360]   and we all have different sphere of influence.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.640]   So I'm not sure how you feel about this
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.000]   or how clear you feel that God is calling you
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.520]   to do something, but I'm sure if you are a believer,
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.520]   you have a relationship with Jesus.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.700]   He has a purpose in you.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.960]   And there is a way that you can be part of his action,
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.340]   no matter in a big way or in a small way.
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:53.440]   So may I invite you to stand as we pray to close.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.600]   [silence]
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:05.340]   Dear Jesus, we thank you.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:12.840]   We thank you that you are such an almighty God
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:19.520]   and with all the powers in your hand,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.380]   you can basically do anything by yourself,
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:27.560]   but you have chosen us to be your people
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:32.380]   and you have chosen us to be part of your action.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:37.360]   Lord, we thank you so much for this opportunity
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.120]   and we thank you so much that we are called
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.760]   to be your people.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:48.880]   Lord, we pray for each one of us in this room.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   We believe that you have a purpose in each one of us.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.620]   You intend us to shine for you
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.460]   and to be your hands and feet
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.060]   in our different spaces we have in our lives.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:17.900]   That you intend us to love the people around us
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.900]   and to show what your love is to the people around us.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:33.200]   So Lord, we pray that your Holy Spirit will show us
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:39.960]   how we can love the people around us,
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.460]   how we can be in action for you,
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.120]   not only in the big moments,
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.120]   remind us to not overlook the small everyday moments.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.920]   Show us what you see.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.940]   Show us how we can serve you
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:02.720]   and serve other people in those areas.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.000]   And also to allow us to grow
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.360]   in loving people and compassion.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.640]   And we pray for those who of us
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:20.360]   who might not 100% sure what the purpose is,
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.680]   how we can follow this.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.040]   Lord, we pray that you will show us,
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.160]   not only show us, but you will take us on this journey
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.600]   and you will show us on each step we are taking.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:42.640]   And for those of who of us are really excited about this,
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.240]   we already know that you have put a calling in us.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.960]   We are excited to put that calling into action
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.520]   in the coming year.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.840]   Lord, we pray that you will remind us
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.640]   to be even more attentive to your heart,
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:02.100]   to seek you first before we do anything,
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.360]   to seek you all the time.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.800]   Lord, may you give us an attentive heart.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.560]   And we invite the Holy Spirit to continue
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.960]   to config us as one community,
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:21.320]   to config us on how we can serve you together
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.700]   as one church, as one community.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:30.480]   And if we are holding onto any fears, any excuses,
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.520]   we pray that you will give us the courage
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.380]   and you will give us the strength to overcome them.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.840]   Lord, thank you that you have sent us
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.260]   to be part of your action,
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.120]   and yet you didn't leave us alone.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.040]   And your Holy Spirit is always there to guide us
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.100]   and lead us.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:00.060]   And we have one another to do them together.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.920]   So Lord, in the coming year,
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.000]   we pray that we can be your hands and feet
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.520]   and we can bring your love to the world around us.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.520]   And we thank you in Jesus' name.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.100]   (gentle music)
