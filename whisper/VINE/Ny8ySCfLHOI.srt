1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
 Amen, amen.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,840
 Thank you, Carla.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,720
 And wow, good morning to the 11 o'clock service.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,720
 You guys can sing.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,680
 That's great, and welcome also to those online

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,020
 who are with us today.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,640
 Normally we worship in the nine o'clock,

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,600
 so this is our neighborhood over here,

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,160
 but this is okay over here too,

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,000
 but this is where we sit,

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,480
 and it's just great to be celebrating here

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,600
 with the 11 o'clock service.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,000
 And thank you, Carla, for those words.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,240
 And also, Emma, for that word again, trust.

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
 You know, a little bit of homework

16
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,640
 just to get us started right away is

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,440
 trust is a powerful word.

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,760
 And we're gonna talk about it a little bit

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,280
 in the sermon today,

20
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,440
 but you might just write that word down every morning,

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,480
 like on your journal or maybe by your computer or something

22
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,640
 because it's a powerful word.

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,920
 And amen, we do not worship a God of scarcity.

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,440
 We worship a God of generosity

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,040
 who's more than enough,

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,400
 and you are always more than enough too

27
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,560
 with our character leadership, with our students.

28
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,920
 It's one of the things we send the message to them,

29
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,960
 that you are enough,

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,200
 as much as the world tries to make us think otherwise.

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,040
 Amen?

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,860
 - Amen.

33
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,320
 - Okay, so we've heard some good words already.

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,640
 Also, Dad's, happy Father's Day.

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,840
 It's Dad's Day.

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,080
 My daughter, our daughter, our middle daughter

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,080
 is living in New York, and she has a film production company

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,080
 so I'm always telling her, tell good dad stories.

39
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,040
 The world needs more good dad stories, amen?

40
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,440
 So yeah, we need probably less dad jokes,

41
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,400
 but we need more good dad stories.

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,040
 Actually, you can never have enough dad jokes.

43
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,960
 Keep them going, dads.

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,840
 We'll keep going.

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,260
 So what I will do this morning is just share

46
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,720
 a little bit from the word of God.

47
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,040
 We're gonna look at a passage together,

48
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,320
 and also just share something of what I've been learning

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,840
 at the university, learning in life here in Hong Kong.

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,840
 And there's a professor at Harvard, Arthur Brooks,

51
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,920
 and he says that all research is really me-search.

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,200
 So all research is really me-search

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,320
 because the researchers are actually

54
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,900
 trying to figure out a question or a problem

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,640
 that they're really interested in

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,520
 or that they're struggling with, right?

57
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,080
 So that's what he kinda says, and as a researcher,

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,080
 I would say it's pretty similar to sermons as well,

59
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,960
 that oftentimes sermons are ones that the pastor,

60
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,200
 the preacher is also working through

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
 in questions that affect all of us,

62
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,360
 and that is definitely the case today

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,240
 because God is working on me in this sermon,

64
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,560
 and I want to share a little bit of what he's saying.

65
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,960
 Vision Sunday, Pastor Andrew gave us this word,

66
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,440
 uncharted, uncharted.

67
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,840
 What does it mean to be in uncharted territory,

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
 unfamiliar territory?

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,880
 And the passage that we're gonna look at today

70
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,400
 has a lot to do with how we can respond in uncharted times.

71
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,920
 And last week, as Carla said, we finished up

72
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,040
 the sermon series on the Holy Spirit,

73
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,120
 but today we'll hear again about the Holy Spirit

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
 'cause the Holy Spirit is the one that guides us

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,680
 in uncharted times.

76
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,680
 But the primary way I believe he guides us

77
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,120
 is through the word of God.

78
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,080
 So don't let Sunday be the only day

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,660
 you open the word of God, amen?

80
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,880
 Open it up in the morning before you go out into our world

81
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,640
 and open yourself to it, and you will find something

82
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,640
 for you or, and something for someone else.

83
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,180
 Few weeks ago, I had breakfast with a leader

84
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,240
 here in Hong Kong, and I've admired him for some time.

85
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,880
 We've had the honor of kind of working together

86
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,160
 in little places, and I've always admired him,

87
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,080
 but particularly I've admired him

88
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,480
 how in the toughest of times, in the meetings

89
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,680
 that seem to, or the situations that seem

90
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,320
 the most complicated, he's always calm,

91
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,240
 and he has wisdom, and he's kind.

92
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,320
 Kind of kind, calm, and confident, you know?

93
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,520
 So I thought, I think I'll have a breakfast with him

94
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,080
 and try to find out a little bit, you know,

95
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,120
 how he does that and just get to know him

96
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,760
 a little bit better, and also to ask

97
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,400
 for some of his prayers.

98
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,600
 And so we got together for breakfast,

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,600
 and I found out that he has memorized over 1,000 verses.

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,040
 Wow, that's a high bar, right?

101
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,960
 And he's an accountant, so he's not exaggerating, right?

102
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,700
 Numbers are important to him.

103
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:57,160
 But he started young, and it's coming through his life.

104
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,080
 So we're gonna look at the word of God

105
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,500
 and say, what does it have to say to us this morning?

106
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,680
 When our family was young, we were living

107
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,640
 in Switzerland, and at that time,

108
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,800
 that's where I started my theological education,

109
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,640
 there at the University of Zurich.

110
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,160
 So at one point in the University of Zurich,

111
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,000
 which Zurich is German-speaking,

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,840
 I was studying Greek in German, okay?

113
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,160
 So I was studying (speaking in foreign language)

114
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,760
 Now, here's the problem.

115
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,860
 My Greek was not that good, right?

116
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,440
 And my German was not that good either.

117
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,840
 So every day in my translations,

118
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,000
 there was a new heresy, right?

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,940
 But the main thing is it was taking me forever

120
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,120
 to kind of get through the courses, right?

121
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,860
 And so I thought, man, I'm not gonna finish this

122
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,960
 before Jesus comes back.

123
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,960
 And for some reason, that was important to me, right?

124
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,300
 So Marian and I talked, and what we decided is

125
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,360
 that I would transfer.

126
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,960
 So I transferred to Princeton Theological Seminary.

127
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,760
 We flew there with our family.

128
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,120
 About two days after we landed there,

129
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,840
 then I was on the playground with our daughter,

130
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,480
 young daughter, she was about three years old at the age.

131
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,780
 We're on the playground, we're doing the dad thing, right?

132
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,920
 We're pushing swings, we're doing duck under

133
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,760
 and all that, you know?

134
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,200
 And we're having fun there, but someone calls my name.

135
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,360
 And then I look across the playground,

136
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,440
 and this guy's running towards me.

137
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,720
 I recognize him, his name's Tomas.

138
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,960
 He was from the Czech Republic,

139
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,160
 and he came up to me, and we started kind of joking

140
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,640
 and laughing, and Tomas has like long brown hair.

141
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,080
 He's a young PhD student.

142
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,640
 Beard, kind of a rugged face.

143
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,240
 And so we're just laughing and joking.

144
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,680
 I'd met him, yeah, just like I said, a couple days before.

145
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,400
 And then, but I noticed that the whole time

146
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,920
 I'm talking with Tomas, our daughter, my daughter,

147
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,480
 cannot take her eyes off of him.

148
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,440
 And she's just got these big eyes looking at Tomas.

149
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,560
 And so we talk a little bit, someone else calls Tomas name,

150
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,520
 he goes running over there, and I turn back to my daughter,

151
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,480
 and she says to me, where did Jesus go?

152
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,000
 [audience laughing]

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,680
 And I thought, good, my daughter thinks I have

154
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,200
 such a great relationship with Jesus

155
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,660
 that we can laugh and joke, and he knows my name,

156
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,320
 and this is good, this is good, right?

157
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,480
 I was quite flattered.

158
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,460
 But that question, where did Jesus go, is a tough one.

159
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:48,560
 It's one probably we've all asked at some point,

160
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
 we've been following Jesus.

161
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,960
 It's also maybe one we're asking right now.

162
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,080
 It may be one that we will ask, or someone we know

163
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,960
 and love is asking right now, because it's a tough time.

164
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,280
 We can't see what Jesus is doing,

165
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,420
 where Jesus is, where is God in this situation.

166
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,660
 Maybe it's uncertain times, uncharted times.

167
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,180
 We just don't know the way we should go.

168
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,940
 Maybe we're overwhelmed at work with everything

169
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,300
 that's going on and put on us, the demands on us.

170
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,060
 Maybe it's in the family, maybe it's an illness,

171
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,060
 maybe even worse, it's the illness of someone we love.

172
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,120
 I don't know what it is, but we go through these times

173
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,740
 where they're definitely uncharted,

174
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,920
 and they're also the times where in the night often,

175
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,520
 we're lying there and we're saying, God, where are you?

176
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,460
 I was following you, and then I've lost you.

177
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,540
 Where are you, Jesus?

178
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,380
 Amen?

179
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,120
 So the word of God has a word for that,

180
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,020
 and some strategies that if we're finding ourselves

181
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,060
 in that situation, I've found to be helpful,

182
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,580
 and I hope they can be helpful to you as well.

183
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,300
 So we're looking at Acts chapter 16,

184
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,300
 and from 25, verse 25 to 34.

185
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,860
 And we'll just look through and then kind of allow ourselves

186
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,720
 to be open to what the scripture is saying.

187
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,380
 Now, the scripture starts with about midnight,

188
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,660
 Paul and Silas were praying.

189
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,160
 But let's stop there, because we need to know

190
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,220
 what happened before about midnight,

191
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,100
 because about midnight, something's going on.

192
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,420
 Midnight is the darkest part of the night.

193
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,540
 Metaphorically, it's the part where we cannot see.

194
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,900
 It is the part where we are only walking by faith

195
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,940
 and not by sight.

196
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,820
 It's a dark night, right?

197
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,460
 And so what happened before then?

198
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,780
 What happened before then is about earlier,

199
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,740
 I don't know how long, maybe a couple weeks earlier,

200
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,060
 the Paul and Silas have arrived in Philippi,

201
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,120
 where the letter of Philippians was going to.

202
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,300
 They've arrived in Philippi.

203
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,980
 They've met a businesswoman named Lydia.

204
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,340
 She's a trader of purple cloth, so she's doing quite well.

205
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,060
 They meet her.

206
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,980
 She opens her home to have the church in her home,

207
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,460
 and they're out on the street, worshiping publicly,

208
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,860
 and preaching publicly, and healing.

209
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,740
 And one of the individuals they heal is a slave girl.

210
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,340
 And this slave girl, because of possession,

211
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,100
 had the ability to foretell the future.

212
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,980
 And so her owners, her masters, were

213
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,180
 making a lot of money off her.

214
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,740
 And when they healed her, that left.

215
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,620
 And so you can kind of follow the money, right?

216
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,300
 So the owners are furious.

217
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,860
 And so what they do is they accuse Paul and Silas

218
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,660
 of public disorder, and they call the magistrates,

219
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,700
 and they create this huge ruckus.

220
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,380
 And what ends up happening is, without any justice,

221
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,020
 without any trial, Paul and Silas are beaten,

222
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,780
 and they're taken, and they're thrown in jail.

223
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,860
 And the jailer is told, put them in the deepest, kind

224
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,140
 of the darkest, the dankest, the very middle of the prison,

225
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,380
 and put them in stocks.

226
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,620
 That's what happened before, about midnight.

227
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:27,220
 So now our verse starts, "About midnight, Paul and Silas

228
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,300
 were praying and singing hymns to God,

229
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,380
 and the prisoners were listening to them.

230
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,460
 And suddenly, there's a great earthquake,

231
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,860
 so that the foundation of the prison was shaken.

232
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,900
 And immediately, all the doors were opened,

233
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,060
 and everyone's bonds were unfastened."

234
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,620
 OK, let's stop there, because I think there's already

235
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,420
 a couple of strategies of what you and I can do if we find

236
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,100
 ourselves in a time of uncertainty

237
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,060
 in uncharted times.

238
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,860
 The first thing is, write the first three words.

239
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,580
 So we read there, Paul and Silas.

240
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,620
 If you had a marker, underline "and,"

241
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,740
 because that's the key word.

242
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,460
 The first thing is, when you're in a tough time,

243
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,740
 when you're in uncharted territory, when you don't know

244
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,220
 which way to go, find your "and."

245
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,940
 We have Paul and Silas.

246
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,380
 Earlier, we would have had Paul and Barnabas.

247
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,940
 Later, we're going to have Paul and Timothy.

248
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,980
 This is the way Paul lived and worked.

249
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:34,140
 For 41 years, Marian has been my "and."

250
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,980
 And she's been my "and" through tough times then.

251
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,140
 She's in my "and" right now during uncharted times.

252
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,660
 I have reached the prestigious age

253
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,060
 of being the mandatory retirement age at HKU.

254
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,340
 So I'm about to step into uncharted territory.

255
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,620
 Remember what I said about me-search?

256
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,420
 This is about this.

257
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,180
 We're dealing with this as well.

258
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,060
 And Marian and I will go through as an "and."

259
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,900
 And you know I'm in pretty good hands there,

260
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,320
 because if you've met Marian, you

261
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,500
 know she is the significantly better half of the equation.

262
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,340
 But it's not about "and"s just in the personal life.

263
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,180
 It's about a way of life.

264
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,180
 Finding your "and" is a way of life.

265
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,060
 And it'll happen in different spheres.

266
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,820
 Because if you're like me, it's probably not just one area.

267
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,260
 There may be one area that you're most concerned at.

268
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,700
 But there's a lot of other areas that challenge us as well.

269
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,900
 And so like at the university, where

270
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,300
 we were helping start the character leadership

271
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,900
 program for undergraduates, it was uncharted territory.

272
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,340
 So I had a co-leader.

273
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,860
 And he and I co-led.

274
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,060
 And we've just handed over to two very gifted uprising

275
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,900
 scholars.

276
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,040
 And they will co-lead.

277
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,180
 One of the things we tell our students is,

278
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,220
 don't do life alone.

279
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,220
 Find your "and."

280
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,020
 Marian and I have been here 16 years now in Hong Kong.

281
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,420
 And during that time, first month I was here,

282
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,660
 I met a pastor by God's kind of gift.

283
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,460
 He lived right next door to me.

284
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,180
 And so we started having a coffee one month.

285
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,460
 We had a coffee the next month.

286
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,300
 And for the next 16 years till now,

287
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,580
 we're trying to-- we have a coffee or a lunch every month.

288
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,380
 And we're each other's "and."

289
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,820
 Encouraging each other, building each other up,

290
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,940
 laughing together with each other.

291
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,980
 There's two theologians, Harawats and Pinchas.

292
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,620
 And I think they say this beautifully.

293
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,860
 So it's a long quote.

294
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,620
 But I want to show you this quote and read you this quote.

295
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,660
 Starts with, "Returning once again,"

296
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,260
 they write, "to our metaphor of the moral life as a journey,

297
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,580
 it's obvious," as Aristotle himself notes,

298
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,680
 "that a journey is better undertaken with companions

299
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,780
 than alone.

300
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,740
 At the very least, we need others

301
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,180
 to sustain us along the way.

302
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,180
 But further," and this is important,

303
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,860
 "and more strongly, traveling with others

304
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,860
 is crucial not only to relieve our boredom

305
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,740
 or supply a hand to hold in the dark and narrow places,

306
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,500
 but as well, the journey requires

307
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,100
 that we ourselves be transformed.

308
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,100
 And we cannot do this without friends."

309
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,100
 Our "and" is not only just to help us.

310
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,740
 It's to help us become who we are.

311
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,900
 And we become who we are during the tough times.

312
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,820
 Crucible moments not only develop our character,

313
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,900
 they reveal our character.

314
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,020
 And we have that "and" working there with us.

315
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,940
 This is not new.

316
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,460
 Jesus sent his disciples out two by two.

317
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,260
 And he's still doing that.

318
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,540
 That's still a way of life for him.

319
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,080
 He sends you out.

320
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,300
 So we find our "and."

321
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,420
 I mean, last weekend, I had a chance

322
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,520
 to kind of work with our CG leaders.

323
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,220
 We were just doing some leadership training,

324
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,340
 and it was great meeting them.

325
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,380
 They're wonderful people.

326
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,020
 They all lead their groups with two or three or at least two

327
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,260
 in leadership.

328
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,140
 And here's the thing.

329
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,020
 There's 60 of those groups going on here at Divine.

330
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,500
 So if you're thinking, who's my "and" or who could be my "and,"

331
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,180
 you don't have to think about it anymore.

332
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,420
 You can just go right out here to the Connect Hub

333
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,500
 and find out, because they're all open to receive new people.

334
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,380
 Find your "and," and why not today?

335
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,980
 Amen?

336
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,060
 OK, so we've covered about five words right now.

337
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,340
 And so at this pace, I hope you guys brought a packed lunch,

338
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,140
 and we're going to all be together.

339
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,720
 And we're going to have to pick it up.

340
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,460
 So first strategy, find your "and."

341
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,740
 The second strategy as we go into untartered territories

342
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,580
 or we find ourselves there is choose to sing.

343
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,460
 Choose to sing.

344
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,860
 So let's go back to our passage.

345
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,540
 It says, "About midnight, Paul and Silas

346
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,380
 were praying and singing hymns to God,

347
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,180
 and the prisoners were listening to them."

348
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,780
 OK, we'll stop there.

349
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,580
 Second strategy, choose to sing.

350
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:23,380
 Augustine is purported to have said, "He who sings,

351
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,060
 prays twice."

352
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,380
 "He who sings, prays twice."

353
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,480
 It's in his writing about the power of hymns and worship,

354
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,460
 which we just experienced, right?

355
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,780
 Because we know that.

356
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,380
 Whether Augustine said it or not,

357
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,140
 we know it to be true because we've just experienced it,

358
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,060
 right?

359
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,060
 We're just holding our hands high a few minutes ago,

360
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,180
 and we're singing, but we're praying, aren't we?

361
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,900
 And there's that praying and singing.

362
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,420
 We're praying twice.

363
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,660
 It's kind of happening as we're singing.

364
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,340
 And we're calling out this, "The one I can trust is this one.

365
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,240
 I sought the Lord, and he answered me with that trust."

366
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,760
 That's the praying and the singing going together.

367
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,160
 When you're in a hard time, it's a hard time to sing,

368
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,000
 but choose to sing.

369
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,600
 In the community church, which I was leading here

370
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,440
 in Hong Kong for a while, we had a prison ministry.

371
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,640
 And I was part of that team.

372
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,200
 And once a month, we would go to Lai Chi Kok.

373
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,560
 And we would be in Lai Chi Kok, and we would basically just

374
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,720
 be with the brothers.

375
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,920
 We'd do some teaching.

376
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
 We'd do some singing.

377
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,880
 We'd do small groups together, basically just

378
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,000
 to encourage each other, be each other's and in that moment.

379
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,320
 And I always was encouraged by them,

380
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,240
 because it's not like we bring Christ into the prison, right?

381
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,320
 Jesus is already in the prison.

382
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,000
 He says, "You visited me in prison," right?

383
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,880
 So we just come and get to be with him there.

384
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,520
 But it was a tough time at Christmas,

385
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,680
 because our brothers, obviously, who are there right now,

386
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,880
 even as we're here, they're there, and they can't leave.

387
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,760
 And so to Christmas time, that was tough.

388
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,200
 And so we would do songs, and we had some great worship people

389
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,960
 leading us.

390
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,000
 And one year, I remember it specially,

391
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,480
 because that year, we tend to happen--

392
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,680
 because we'd be about 30 or 40 people at that time.

393
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,440
 We tend to have quite a number from South America.

394
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,400
 So we were singing "Feliz Navidad," right?

395
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,400
 Now, "Feliz Navidad" is good, I think, any time of the year.

396
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,880
 But "Feliz Navidad," we're just belting it out.

397
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,000
 And that year, we were in the canteen

398
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,240
 at Lychee Cock, which is on the higher floors.

399
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,160
 The windows are open, if you imagine.

400
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,040
 We're here, windows out there.

401
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,960
 And then down below are the basketball courts.

402
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
 And we're just singing at the top of our lungs,

403
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,680
 "Feliz Navidad."

404
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,000
 And most of it's in Spanish.

405
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,200
 I don't know what I'm singing, but we're just

406
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,920
 belting it out, right?

407
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,040
 And then later, the people tell us

408
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,680
 that the basketball players, they were listening.

409
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,600
 Did you hear what Paul--

410
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,720
 or what Acts says about Paul and the other prisoners

411
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,200
 who were listening?

412
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:07,480
 Never underestimate your ability to encourage others around you

413
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,960
 when, in a tough time, by the grace of God

414
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,800
 and the power of the Holy Spirit, you choose to sing.

415
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,080
 Because we don't know what everyone's going through,

416
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,560
 but we know someone, everyone, is going through something.

417
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,480
 Philo of Alexandria, he said this.

418
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,400
 He said, "Be kind, because everyone you meet

419
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,440
 is facing a battle."

420
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,120
 Just look around this room.

421
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,240
 This room is full.

422
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,680
 How many battles do we have going on in here, right?

423
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,760
 So we be kind.

424
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,360
 That's another way of singing.

425
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,160
 When I say choose to sing, it could be literal singing.

426
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,120
 And that's important.

427
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,600
 And research has shown we can build our character.

428
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,640
 There's playlists for characters.

429
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,960
 I mean, there's songs that build up our courage, right?

430
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
 Like, this is my fight song.

431
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,040
 Take back my life song.

432
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,120
 I mean, you know, this is like-- right.

433
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,360
 And that's kind of-- before I go into meeting,

434
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
 I listen to that song.

435
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:06,880
 No.

436
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,320
 But we know the power of music.

437
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,120
 But there's other ways to choose to sing.

438
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,240
 One is being kind.

439
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,960
 Other is maybe giving thanks to God,

440
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,280
 when you don't feel like giving thanks to God,

441
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
 because there's power in that.

442
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,700
 We were in a meeting the other day.

443
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,320
 And one of the professors said, there's

444
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,920
 something kind of almost defiant by our saying,

445
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,880
 thank you, God, in this situation.

446
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,560
 Why?

447
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,040
 Not thank you for the situation, but we

448
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,720
 thank him because, as we sing, we can trust him, right?

449
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,000
 So maybe-- here's some more homework.

450
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,520
 We've already got one homework, another homework coming.

451
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,160
 But maybe tomorrow, when you go into whatever your work

452
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,400
 situation is, maybe it's the dining room table.

453
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,560
 Maybe it's an office.

454
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,360
 Maybe it's a studio.

455
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,840
 Maybe you're in front of students.

456
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,560
 Maybe-- I don't know where--

457
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,720
 but right before you start, maybe just write down,

458
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,800
 thank you, God, for this time and place.

459
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,680
 Because you can do that.

460
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,240
 I've done that sometimes when I wasn't really that thankful.

461
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,000
 But I was thankful when I thought about what it is

462
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,520
 and what God was doing.

463
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,320
 That's a choosing to sing.

464
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,040
 That gives courage to you, but also encourages others.

465
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,520
 But be very clear.

466
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:37,200
 It is a choice to sing.

467
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,160
 We do have a choice of how we respond, even

468
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,800
 to the worst of situations.

469
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,920
 Viktor Frankl, who has also found himself

470
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,920
 in the worst of the worst of the prisons,

471
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,360
 and that is in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany.

472
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,240
 And when most did not survive, he said, as a psychologist,

473
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,920
 he said, they can never take away

474
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,040
 your power of how you respond.

475
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,960
 You choose that.

476
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,600
 Is it a hard choice?

477
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,320
 Yes.

478
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
 Do you feel like, I think I'll sing right away?

479
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,680
 No.

480
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,600
 It's a hard choice.

481
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,240
 In fact, for some of us, it's harder than others.

482
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
 I'm not really that good at this.

483
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,800
 But some of my aunts are very good at this.

484
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,040
 Marianne's quite good at this in terms of facing things

485
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,360
 with joy.

486
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,200
 Choose to sing.

487
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,840
 That's a second strategy.

488
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,600
 OK, so now we've finished one verse,

489
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,520
 and we've still got a ways to go.

490
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,080
 But here's this.

491
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,920
 Is this making sense?

492
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,560
 Is this helpful?

493
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,040
 Yeah?

494
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,680
 All good?

495
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,920
 OK, I'll trust you.

496
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,360
 There you go, please.

497
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,040
 Let's go on then to the third, the third strategy

498
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,440
 which our verse, our passage tells us.

499
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,120
 And I think to understand the rest,

500
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,240
 and we'll take the rest of the verse or the passages

501
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,240
 all together, because it's like they're all connected.

502
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,000
 And when it starts to flow, it doesn't stop until the end.

503
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And so we'll take all those together.

504
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,400
 But there may be two stories that

505
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,000
 would be helpful for you before we

506
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,200
 get right into that scripture.

507
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,520
 The first thought that might be helpful to you

508
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:31,160
 is that when we're on uncharted territory--

509
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,840
 and I have been in that uncharted territory.

510
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,240
 I'm about to be in it again.

511
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,880
 But five years ago, I was in that uncharted territory.

512
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,280
 Because I went from being in a church where

513
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,400
 I had been for about 20 years, leading in some capacity.

514
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,120
 And so it was familiar, right?

515
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,840
 And then I went to the university,

516
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,640
 which was uncharted for me.

517
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,800
 Uncharted for me, right?

518
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,040
 It was unfamiliar to me.

519
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,640
 And God, in his grace, gave me a verse.

520
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,980
 And this is the verse he gave me.

521
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,000
 He gave me Galatians 5, 25.

522
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,680
 And the verse is, "If we live by the Spirit,

523
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,760
 let us stay in step with the Spirit."

524
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,180
 If we live by the Spirit, let us stay in step with the Spirit.

525
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,560
 That's a great verse if you don't know where you're going,

526
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,400
 which I didn't, right?

527
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,400
 My dad, who's a medical missionary for half his life,

528
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,800
 and then he's a microbiologist.

529
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,120
 And so, second half, he was as a dean of science

530
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,600
 in a university.

531
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,720
 But he liked to paraphrase this Galatians 5, 25.

532
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,200
 And he would say this, "If the Lord is the source

533
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,200
 of your life, let him direct the course of your life."

534
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,720
 So if the Lord, or the Spirit, is the source of your life,

535
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,160
 then let him direct the course of your life.

536
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,360
 And I think this is quite beautiful.

537
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,400
 So I thought, you know, I'd put dad there on Father's Day.

538
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,360
 Thought he might like being with Augustine

539
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,120
 and fellow of Alexandria, dad of Austin.

540
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,120
 So, but he's right.

541
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,840
 Then, another little vignette that might be helpful for you

542
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,520
 in understanding the passage really comes

543
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,800
 from on HKU campus a few years ago.

544
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,880
 We were introducing the service aspect

545
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,560
 of the character leadership program.

546
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,880
 So we're trying to teach, there's about 600 students

547
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,200
 involved in the program now, all four years.

548
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,240
 It's going to a two-year program next year,

549
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,200
 or actually started this year.

550
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,640
 And, but we're trying to teach them character leadership.

551
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,400
 How do you develop your character?

552
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,600
 One of those ways that we were doing it at the beginning

553
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,040
 was really to have service projects.

554
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,600
 Because obviously, if you're serving someone else,

555
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,160
 then you're building your character.

556
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,260
 And we tell our students, it's not about you.

557
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,140
 If you think it's about you,

558
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,840
 you're never gonna be happy, right?

559
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,000
 If you think it's about another,

560
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,280
 you have a chance of finding that happiness.

561
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,480
 So, but we thought, who can we ask to come and speak to us

562
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,080
 on service leadership, right?

563
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,200
 And so we immediately thought of Jackie Pullinger, right?

564
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,500
 Now what you may not know is that Jackie Pullinger

565
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,160
 has an honorary doctorate from HKU.

566
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,740
 So that works really well.

567
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,680
 But she also, and most importantly,

568
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,280
 has dedicated her life and is continuing to serving others.

569
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,040
 And so we invited her to come on.

570
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,440
 And so we were interviewing her.

571
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,720
 So there's a stage, and if you imagine

572
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,060
 you're all the students, and then there's up here,

573
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,220
 my co-leader was interviewing her, Frances Choi.

574
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,320
 So Frances Choi starts the interview by talking to Jackie,

575
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,320
 and he says, "Jackie, you have done so much in your life,

576
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,360
 "and you are doing so much in your life.

577
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,880
 "You must be a very driven person."

578
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,280
 And then Jackie says this.

579
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,440
 She says, "I'm not driven, I'm led."

580
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,120
 Now if you know Jackie, you know how she said that, right?

581
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,920
 "I'm not driven, I'm led."

582
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,920
 And that makes all the difference, if you think about it.

583
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,120
 And for our students, it really struck home,

584
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,040
 because they feel driven.

585
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,040
 They feel driven to meet the expectations of others.

586
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,880
 They feel driven to get the best job.

587
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,320
 They feel driven.

588
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,520
 It ran home to me.

589
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,800
 I'm like taking notes in the back, right?

590
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,940
 Because sometimes I feel driven.

591
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,100
 And maybe it resonates with you.

592
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,960
 Maybe there's parts of you that feel more driven than led.

593
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,720
 But in Jesus Christ, we are not driven, we are led.

594
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,560
 Amen?

595
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,660
 Very simple.

596
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,400
 Jesus as a good leader condensed it down

597
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,700
 to two words of what we're supposed to do.

598
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,200
 Follow me.

599
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
 That's the plan.

600
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,820
 That was the plan then, that's the plan now,

601
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,420
 is that we follow him.

602
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:58,740
 We are not driven by him, we are led by him.

603
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,080
 And Galatians 5.25 has this imagery of a dance, right?

604
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,420
 And it's like stay in step with the Holy Spirit.

605
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:12,220
 So the Holy Spirit's dancing, and we're staying in step.

606
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,100
 Some years ago, Miriam and I thought we would do

607
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,700
 a couple dancing course, and it was fun.

608
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,300
 We had a fun time doing it.

609
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,340
 But we had a problem because it was couples dancing,

610
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,980
 so someone has to lead, right?

611
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,940
 And we're both leaders, so this was a trouble, right?

612
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,220
 No one wanted to follow.

613
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:35,260
 But it's not a question in the Holy Spirit.

614
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,460
 We follow the Holy Spirit, and trust me,

615
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,040
 he has a better plan than I do or you do, right?

616
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,840
 So we follow the Holy Spirit.

617
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,640
 Now, think about those two things,

618
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,040
 following the Holy Spirit, think about we're not driven,

619
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,320
 we're not led, and then let's read through the rest

620
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,640
 of this passage as we get into it.

621
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,700
 So we begin again, and we pick up with verse 27.

622
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,400
 When the jailer woke and he saw that the prison doors

623
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,960
 were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself,

624
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,880
 supposing that the prisoners had escaped.

625
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,240
 But Paul cried out with a loud voice,

626
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,040
 "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here."

627
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,280
 And the jailer called for lights and rushed in,

628
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,120
 and trembling with fear, the jailer fell down

629
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
 before Paul and Silas.

630
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,280
 This is a turn of events.

631
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,360
 And then he brought them out and said,

632
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,080
 "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"

633
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,000
 And that word there, saved, literally means,

634
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,920
 it means rescued, it means wholeness,

635
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,180
 complete healing, well-being, it means life overflowing,

636
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,920
 as Carla was talking earlier.

637
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,440
 What must I do to be saved?

638
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,780
 And they said, "Believe," and that word is literally trust,

639
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,560
 "in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved,

640
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560
 "you and your household."

641
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,680
 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him.

642
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,800
 Do you see how this and is working?

643
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,640
 It doesn't say Paul or Timothy,

644
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,820
 they're just working together.

645
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,660
 They spoke the word of the Lord to him.

646
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,280
 And he took them the same hour of the night,

647
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,880
 and he washed their wounds, and he was baptized.

648
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,960
 So now we're seeing a conversion experience

649
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,880
 of the jailer, right?

650
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,840
 He's making reparations, he's making right for his wrongs,

651
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,560
 he's washing them, there's the water of baptism,

652
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,060
 then it goes on, and he invites them into their home,

653
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,760
 there's hospitality, he sets food on the table for them,

654
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,960
 right, this is where we like it as Hong Kongers, right?

655
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,300
 There's food now, and of course, when food comes,

656
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,840
 then also joy comes, right?

657
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,880
 And then it says after that, then there's joy, joy,

658
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,160
 unbelievable joy, and I don't think we talk enough

659
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,720
 about joy and salvation together, but there's joy.

660
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:49,060
 When I came to the Lord in northern Nigeria,

661
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:54,460
 it just was an experience that I knew this is right,

662
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,540
 and there was joy.

663
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,300
 So let me say this, if there's anyone here

664
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,460
 who has not yet said, "I wanna follow him,"

665
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,280
 like we've just heard, why not now?

666
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,080
 Why not even today if the Lord is speaking to you?

667
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,980
 Because there's always this invitation, follow me.

668
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,260
 And all we have to do is kinda crack the window

669
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,700
 a little bit of our hearts, and this joy and change

670
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,500
 and rightness comes sweeping in.

671
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,100
 But we do have to act, we do have to say yes,

672
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,740
 'cause he's not someone who's gonna force himself on anyone.

673
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,700
 And so we say yes, it's the easiest thing in the world to do

674
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,540
 'cause all you have to do is give everything to Jesus.

675
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,220
 It's the hardest thing in the world to do

676
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,800
 'cause all you have to do is give everything to Jesus.

677
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,100
 But trust me, it's worth it.

678
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,540
 And if you're online, also you're invited.

679
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,420
 But most of us in this room probably have said yes.

680
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,840
 And we've been following, sometimes it's been in the dark,

681
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,700
 sometimes we're not sure exactly where it's going,

682
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,740
 Jesus is going, but we followed him.

683
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,140
 And so the dance for us is not the dance of salvation,

684
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,700
 the dance for us is the dance of staying in step

685
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,040
 on a daily basis.

686
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,220
 Now if the dance metaphor is not working for you,

687
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,820
 that's fine, we can choose another one,

688
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,460
 you can say like music with maybe it's an orchestra

689
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,400
 and the leader is guiding everybody

690
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,260
 from what could be cacophony to beautiful music and joy.

691
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,620
 Maybe it's basketball, maybe you're imagining

692
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,940
 that you're part of the Pacers, you're part of the Thunder

693
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,940
 and you're kind of tracking that

694
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,260
 and they're just moving so beautifully in step

695
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,420
 with each other, maybe it's just you're taking a walk

696
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,680
 and you're with someone you love and you're just in step.

697
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:51,660
 Whatever, the call for all of us is to stay in step

698
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,260
 with the Holy Spirit.

699
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,300
 So how do we do that?

700
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,720
 So I'm just gonna tell you one way that I have found helpful

701
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,600
 and offer it to you.

702
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,400
 Here's one way we can do it.

703
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,900
 We go back to Galatians 5.25.

704
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,680
 Galatians 5.25, if we live by the Spirit,

705
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,820
 let us keep in step with the Spirit, okay?

706
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,900
 So here's how we work with it.

707
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,540
 So tomorrow, it's homework number three,

708
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,260
 sorry, I've gotta get out of the university, right?

709
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,500
 But anyway, there's homework number three,

710
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,500
 is tomorrow, when you go in, before you go in,

711
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,580
 so that would be today, if we live by the Spirit,

712
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,740
 let us keep in step with the Spirit, memorize it.

713
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,440
 Memorize it, it's easy to memorize.

714
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,060
 Actually better, learn it by heart

715
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,780
 because there's a difference.

716
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,740
 It's not just head knowledge, but learn it by heart.

717
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,340
 While you're memorizing it,

718
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,420
 thinking about how it applies in your life, right?

719
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,860
 That's step one.

720
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,620
 Step two, you go in, you sit down wherever you are,

721
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,620
 or you stand up wherever you are at work,

722
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,540
 and you just say a prayer.

723
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,740
 Jesus, help me stay in step with you today.

724
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,260
 And then just keep your eyes open.

725
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,020
 Attentiveness is one of the highest forms of love.

726
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,440
 So be attentive to the movements of the Holy Spirit tomorrow

727
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,580
 as you love Jesus, right?

728
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,020
 And just see what happens.

729
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,740
 Sometimes what I find is I just run into random people.

730
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,660
 They're not random at all,

731
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,500
 but they're people I did not expect to run into on campus,

732
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,460
 but I do.

733
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,660
 And then maybe a thought comes, or a call comes,

734
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,960
 or a text comes, or I feel prompted

735
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,460
 to send a text of encouragement to someone.

736
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,660
 That's part of the dance.

737
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,220
 That's part of staying in step with the Holy Spirit.

738
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,300
 So I found that helpful, and I offer it to you.

739
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:43,300
 Something that I think the Spirit can give us.

740
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,940
 Spirit is spiritual, but very practical.

741
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,100
 (silence)

742
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:54,980
 So where did Jesus go?

743
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,660
 That was the question.

744
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,500
 And sometimes the best questions come from children.

745
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,660
 Out of the mouth of babes, we get this beautiful wisdom.

746
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,460
 It's a tough question.

747
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,460
 But I have found that if I am going through those times,

748
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,020
 if I ask and find my and,

749
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,820
 seek and find my and, then it's better.

750
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,960
 Don't do life alone.

751
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,980
 And then I've also found that if I choose to sing,

752
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,620
 then it is a choice that I can make

753
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,100
 by the power of the Holy Spirit

754
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,060
 and the grace of the Holy Spirit.

755
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,840
 And then, stay in step.

756
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,100
 We are not driven in Jesus Christ.

757
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,620
 We are led.

758
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:47,620
 Let him lead you into this beautiful life that is life.

759
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,900
 Amen?

760
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,560
 Okay, will you pray with me?

761
00:36:52,560 --> 00:37:05,940
 We're just gonna take some time of giving you time

762
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,620
 to pray if you want to pray.

763
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,980
 If you're not a follower, either online or here,

764
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,820
 that's okay.

765
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,380
 I mean, you can still pray if you want to,

766
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,840
 or you can just reflect on what we've been talking about.

767
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,220
 But if you're here and you're a follower of Jesus Christ,

768
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,260
 if there was something that spoke to you,

769
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,360
 maybe more than other, go there.

770
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,980
 And when you go there,

771
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,280
 begin to have a conversation with God.

772
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,660
 So let me pray for you as you start that conversation.

773
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,000
 Jesus, I pray for humility,

774
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,540
 that in whatever that there place is for us,

775
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,260
 we would be humble to receive

776
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,260
 and to know that we need to receive.

777
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,020
 And I pray for courage,

778
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,980
 courage that we would then receive

779
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,920
 and courage that we can know what to do.

780
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,560
 You tell us that blessed are those who don't hear,

781
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,260
 but blessed are those who do the word of God.

782
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,800
 We want to be blessed, Jesus.

783
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,420
 So just where you are, heart to heart with God,

784
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,160
 quiet your conversation.

785
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,440
 Let's pray to God.

786
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,020
 (gentle music)

787
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,600
 (gentle music)

788
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,180
 (gentle music)

789
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,760
 (gentle music)

790
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:37,760
