[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500]   Amen, amen, amen.
[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.460]   We wanna thank the worship team.
[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.300]   Thank you guys.
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.740]   (congregation applauding)
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.460]   Why don't you go ahead and grab a seat, everyone.
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.500]   Welcome to the Vine.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.160]   Welcome to the 11 o'clock as per youge.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.260]   It is full.
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.940]   It is real full.
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.920]   There's like no room in here at all.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.660]   Well, guys, I am Promise.
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.820]   I am the creative pastor here at the Vine.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.700]   Welcome, so glad you're here.
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.640]   And to those who are watching online, also welcome.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.000]   We're so glad that you're tuned in.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.420]   You're not here, but you're kind of here.
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.260]   So thanks for that connection.
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.000]   We've been going through this series over the past few,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.700]   actually since the beginning of the year on intimacy.
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.540]   All right, if you've been here,
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.200]   you would have heard Pastor Andrew talk about this idea,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.540]   this concept of intimacy.
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.380]   And it's a strange word trying to figure out
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.220]   what does that mean?
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.220]   So we've been exploring it.
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.220]   We've been peeling back the layers and understanding
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.780]   what does it mean for you and for me
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.380]   to find our intimacy with God?
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.440]   Pastor Andrew would have shared with you
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.200]   that we as a leadership here at the Vine
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.080]   have been really wrestling with this idea.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.640]   God spoke to us and has challenged us
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.960]   to lead the charge in helping us all understand
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.680]   that God has called us not just to come into the gates
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.280]   and stand at the entrance.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.120]   Or another way of putting it,
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.200]   he's not called us to settle for the atmosphere of God,
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560]   but he actually has called us to press in
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.720]   to the person of who God is.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   Intimacy is when we press beyond the atmosphere.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.100]   We don't just settle for an idea of God,
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.260]   but pressing in to the person of who God himself is.
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.920]   To not just be satisfied with the atmosphere.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.780]   This kind of call is an invitation to a real journey.
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.600]   Intimacy is not a one-time thing.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.340]   It doesn't just snap and happen.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.320]   It's a whole journey.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.360]   And so far we've looked at some of the obstacles
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.680]   that present themselves in our journey
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.580]   towards intimacy with God.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.320]   The first thing we talked about with this concept
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.380]   of rumors of God, how if we're not careful,
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.640]   we can settle for secondhand accounts
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   of what someone else says about God
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.680]   to be our primary intimacy.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.320]   Pastor Andrew would have had this little basket
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.560]   and he would have shown you what it looks like to harvest
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.080]   and what it looks like to glean,
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.800]   to pick up the leftovers of what somebody else said.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.120]   And in order for us to actually have intimacy with Christ,
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.180]   we cannot allow the substance of our spiritual life
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.720]   to just be on someone else's account.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.940]   Intimacy means you and me have to do the hard work
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.200]   of actually being relational with God, coming close to him.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.680]   We can't just let it be someone else's story
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.840]   or someone else's sermon.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.920]   That's predominantly why you hear us regularly say
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.560]   that church cannot just be 90 minutes on a Sunday.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.000]   That's not just a cool saying.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.640]   It's 'cause for you to be intimate with God,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.880]   you've gotta press through.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.880]   It's gotta be your time as well.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.040]   The idea of secondhand rumors of God,
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.740]   what other people says can be a challenge to our intimacy.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.740]   And if you were here last week,
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.860]   you also heard Pastor Andrew talk
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.420]   about this idea of blessings, right?
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.740]   And blessings are a good thing.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.220]   We all love blessings.
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.620]   I want blessings, you want blessings,
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.460]   we all want blessings.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.240]   Blessings aren't bad.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.140]   However, our relationship to blessings,
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.540]   our posture to blessings is worth questioning.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.620]   We have the temptation sometimes if we're not careful
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.640]   to evaluate our intimacy with God
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.080]   based off of how blessed we are,
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.960]   how many things he's given us.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.900]   And if we determine our intimacy with God
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.840]   based off of our blessings,
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.160]   we all know that blessings come and blessings go.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160]   Some days we are extremely blessed
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.440]   and it's everywhere and it's evident and it's tangible.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.380]   Some days we're in the desert,
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.320]   but that doesn't mean God has left you.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.840]   It doesn't mean God is absent.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.940]   That's why we can't build our intimacy on blessings
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.440]   because we end up building our intimacies with blessings.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.080]   We end up worshiping the gift over the giver,
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.660]   finding ourselves in a form of idolatry.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.700]   That's the second thing that ends up being an obstacle,
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.700]   a challenge to our relationship of intimacy with God.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.080]   See, intimacy is such a powerful thing.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.280]   Intimacy is vast.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.960]   It's going to shape the way that you see yourself,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.420]   the way that you see life,
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.320]   the way that you are aligned,
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.320]   the things that you understand.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.160]   And if we're intimate with God, He shapes us.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.560]   He aligns us to Him and to His will.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.560]   He shapes our motivations, our preferences,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.280]   our thought process, the way that we think.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   He shapes our philosophies and our worldviews
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.680]   and our behaviors and our practices.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.880]   Intimacy and this closeness with God aligns us to Him
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.640]   so that we can know and be close to the heart of God.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.640]   We can hear the creator speak
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.800]   and know that when we speak, He listens and hears us.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.600]   Now, if we actually pull it back a little further,
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   yeah, I dare say that intimacy is the gift of God Himself.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.560]   That's why we're talking about it.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   That's why it's so important.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.640]   Now, achieving intimacy is one thing, right?
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.040]   Getting there, I'm intimate, awesome, cool.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.080]   Maintaining intimacy is a whole 'nother struggle.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.720]   Yes, there are things that will prevent us
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.360]   in our pursuits of intimacy,
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.680]   but once we have achieved
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.660]   and once we have become intimate with God,
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.200]   there are also other things.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.200]   There are also false gods, lesser goods,
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.720]   alternatives, faulty substitutes that position themselves
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.680]   and present themselves as viable options to God,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.520]   looking to take our worship and our attention and our time.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.960]   There are substitutes that are all around us,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.480]   not just obstacles blocking us,
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.680]   things that we can literally turn to accidentally
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.100]   and find our intimacy with them.
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.500]   And that's what we're gonna be looking at
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.820]   over the next two weeks.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.260]   Two major things that we, if we're not careful,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.260]   will turn to and find intimacy with,
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260]   things that literally end up taking the place
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.980]   of God in our lives.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.540]   So with that said, let's talk about these things
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.460]   that we turn to.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.060]   It's good for us to understand this,
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.380]   that we have this tendency that when we fail
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.640]   to find intimacy in Christ,
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.280]   we are then tempted to turn somewhere else.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.880]   Now this is not like some big spiritual concept.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.040]   This is an everyday thing.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.120]   If you try at something and you fail to find the success
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.980]   you need at it, by nature,
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.920]   you're gonna look somewhere else for it, right?
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.800]   Like if I try hard to turn this light on
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.960]   and it's not working, I'm gonna go find another light.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.800]   That just makes sense.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.720]   That's just common sense.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.880]   But for us, we have to be aware that
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.160]   if we fail to find intimacy
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.260]   or fail to find satisfaction in Christ,
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.400]   then these other things become seemingly more desirable,
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.820]   seemingly like they'll fulfill more,
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.360]   like they will give us the validation
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.620]   and the significance that we think that we need,
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.680]   that they would satisfy.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.440]   And if we're not aware, other things,
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.580]   good things, end up taking the place in our hearts
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.400]   that only God was ever actually meant to occupy.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.280]   And that's why we have to wrap our heads around this
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.560]   and think around it and be careful.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.980]   Perhaps one of the most common,
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.400]   one of the easiest forms,
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.400]   one of the most inconspicuous things that wrestles
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.520]   and seeks and pulls us into intimacy.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.640]   And if we're not aware of it,
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.400]   we'll find ourselves turning to it time and time again.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.240]   It's called the world.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.040]   Now, I grew up in church
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   and I've heard the phrase the world a lot.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.000]   It speaks, it's really big, it's kind of a big concept.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.560]   It doesn't really say a lot, is the world,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.600]   what does that even mean, right?
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.840]   Like the world is a lot,
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.320]   but the world is also nothing in this explanation.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.680]   But we do know that scripture as a whole
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.560]   speaks about this concept of the world.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.880]   And my hope is that as we look into scripture today,
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.240]   we'll be able to help you understand
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.360]   what does it mean for the world to vie for our affections
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.060]   and what does it look like for our response
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.280]   to be correct in that.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.000]   Specifically, the author John in 1 John
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.960]   has a lot to say about the world.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.760]   So if you have your Bibles, if you have your smartphones,
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.920]   if you like the screen, we have it right here.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.800]   So let's read this together, it says this.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.200]   Do not love the world or anything in the world.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.720]   If anyone loves the world,
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.040]   love for the Father is not in them.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.800]   For everything in the world, the lust of the flesh
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.960]   and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.540]   comes not from the Father, but from the world.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.200]   The world and its desires pass away,
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.360]   but whoever does the will of God lives forever.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.560]   Let me pray for us.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.500]   God, we come before your word knowing that it's speak,
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.600]   that it's living and active,
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.320]   that it's meant to speak to our hearts,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.960]   that it's meant to shape us and change us.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.880]   So Holy Spirit, would you open us this morning?
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.480]   Would you allow us to position ourselves
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.760]   to hear from you, God?
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.080]   What your word has to say,
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.600]   will you allow us to position ourselves
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.880]   to be shaped by the truth found in your word, God?
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.620]   May it speak and may we be a people who hear and respond.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.580]   So you name me pray, amen.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.800]   So the first thing that we see in this passage
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.360]   is that John is gonna create somewhat of a duality.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.820]   He's gonna create two options.
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.720]   There's the way of the world,
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.040]   then there's the way of the Father.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.960]   He's not saying that they're bad or good,
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.320]   he's just saying there's the world and there is the Father.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.680]   Two different ways, two paths,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.840]   if you would have it that way,
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.840]   two alternative options for how your intimacy can be placed
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.640]   and how you can live.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.040]   Actually, if we zoom in even further,
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.200]   we'll see that across these two passages,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   John is going to emphasize one phrase a lot.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.320]   He's gonna look at the word the world
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.960]   six times in two verses.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.500]   Do not love the world, anything in the world,
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.600]   if anyone loves the world, in the world,
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.160]   from the world, the world and its desires.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.280]   John is speaking predominantly to a concept of the world
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.280]   and when something, a good little tip for you
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.440]   in your Bible studying, in your scripture reading,
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.600]   when you read a passage and you see a phrase
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.800]   show up over and over and over and over again,
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.480]   the author is intending for us to pick something up.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.360]   He's showing us what the key concept truly is.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.160]   And what John is doing here is showing us
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.560]   that there's something about the world
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.040]   that we need to understand before we decide
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.600]   where our allegiance will be.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.280]   So the word that he uses to represent the world
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.840]   is the Greek word that we get our English word,
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.440]   cosmos, from.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.480]   Now, the cosmos is something that might be quite familiar
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.380]   to all of us, right?
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.760]   Cosmos speaks of the world.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.080]   We think of the physical planet, the physical space.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.300]   That's one of the biggest definitions
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.240]   of what that word means,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.460]   speaking of the earth and matter and substance
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.440]   and things that are tangible that we can feel and touch.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.360]   However, when John is talking about that,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.640]   he's talking about the world,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.460]   it would be really odd to utilize this definition,
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.640]   to not love the physical space,
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.280]   to not love the earth and the ground
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.320]   and the sphere that we live in.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.840]   So actually, in Greek, there's two definitions,
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.860]   or two primary definitions to the word cosmos.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.000]   Yes, there is the idea of the earth and the physical space.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.120]   However, there's a secondary definition
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.240]   which speaks of this.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.000]   It speaks to systems and structural ways of doing things
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.920]   that are different from God.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.320]   That's what the word itself means.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.000]   The world can speak of the sphere,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.920]   or it can speak of the systems that are different than God
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.200]   in how we do things,
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.940]   speaking to the intangible elements of the world.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.000]   So for us to understand what he's saying
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.940]   about these systems and its impact,
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.780]   we're gonna dive really deeply into the idea of the world.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.820]   I'm gonna give us an easy definition to remember
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.960]   so that we can hold onto it.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.840]   So when I say the phrase the world,
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.260]   we won't think so general,
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.380]   but we'll have a clear position of what that means, okay?
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.740]   Everyone with me still?
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.900]   All right, so when we speak of the world,
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.820]   John is primarily saying this,
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.580]   the societal or cultural systems and attitudes
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.700]   that govern our values, beliefs, and practices.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.560]   Say that one more time.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.540]   When John is saying do not love the world
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.900]   and the world this and the world that,
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.620]   he's speaking of the societal or cultural systems
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.820]   and attitudes that govern our values,
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.940]   beliefs, and our practices.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.400]   See, culture can shape things around us.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.420]   Culture is powerful.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.020]   It can shape the way that we process information.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.900]   It can govern our understanding
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.820]   of our feelings and our behavior.
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.340]   It can define for us what is right,
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.140]   and it can define for us what is wrong.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.780]   It becomes the lens that we wear
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.040]   to evaluate the experiences that we have
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.180]   as either good or worthy or not enjoyable.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.580]   Culture is powerful because it sets for us
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.540]   a set of general norms that we live within,
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.340]   and sometimes we don't even question it.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.660]   It's just the way things are, right?
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.540]   Culture shapes and molds the way that we think.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:12.740]   So when John is speaking of the world,
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.860]   he's speaking of the authority that we give culture
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.220]   to decide for us what is true and what is right,
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.820]   what is good, what is important,
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.180]   what our priorities should be,
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.020]   what we should believe, and what we should do.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.380]   And if he's saying that six times across two verses,
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.040]   let's actually ask ourselves,
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.660]   what does culture actually say?
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.500]   We all live here.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.160]   What does culture say to us, right?
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.820]   Culture directs the way that we live.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.820]   It directs our lives.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.460]   It tells us, study hard, work harder,
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.620]   get a good job, save a lot of money.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.140]   Don't get married so you can afford
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.940]   to take care of your spouse and feed your kids, right?
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.900]   Nothing bad about that.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.060]   Those are actually some good statements, good ways to live.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.700]   But the culture that we live in values that.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.840]   It tells us this is how we ought to be.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.780]   Culture gives us formula.
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.820]   It says if you work hard or work hard enough,
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.140]   you'll earn a lot and you'll be able
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.020]   to take care of yourself.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.060]   And give the money to things that are promising,
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.780]   to things of value.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.460]   Save a lot for yourself.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.960]   You never know when you're gonna need
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.640]   some extra change.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.580]   Culture can define our behavior.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.940]   An eye for an eye.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.780]   Do the practical thing that makes sense.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.660]   Don't loan money to people who can't pay you back.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.420]   Eh, it kinda makes sense.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.740]   You get what you deserve.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.960]   Take care of yourself first.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.060]   Worry about your own problems.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.180]   Mind your own business before you worry
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.620]   about the other person's issues.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.980]   Seek the road that gives you the highest return.
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.700]   Perhaps seek pleasure and avoid pain.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.300]   Love your neighbor.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.040]   Treat your neighbor good.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.200]   Maybe not hate your enemy,
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.400]   but don't got time for haters, right?
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.760]   Haters are gonna hate, I think is the famous phrase
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.160]   that goes around these days.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.500]   Culture validates significance.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:03.720]   You have meaning because you're popular.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.520]   You have value because what you're saying
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.480]   and what you're doing and what you're producing is relevant.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.920]   The more followers you have,
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.640]   the higher your worth somehow becomes.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.800]   That's a weird system.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.660]   The more friends you have online,
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.040]   that makes you into a more likable person.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.880]   Maybe, but that's just kind of what we've accepted.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.440]   That's kind of how things are.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.920]   And perhaps the most interesting one
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.160]   is that culture shapes the how.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.880]   Manifest it and it will happen.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.320]   Have you ever heard that idea?
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.240]   Manifest it and it'll happen, just will it into existence.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.040]   Life is what you make of it.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.040]   Live your truth.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.800]   You're the captain of your soul.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.220]   Self-care and repeat, just follow your heart.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.060]   Just live.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.920]   I think YOLO used to be a cool thing for millennials.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.640]   Where I come from, it's risk it for the biscuit.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.520]   Or if you grew up in black culture,
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.060]   it's you do you, boo-boo.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.920]   All right, like these are the things that we hear.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.020]   These are the things that ends up shaping us.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.360]   The reality is that these sayings and these beliefs
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.160]   are a direct byproduct of the culture we live in.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.400]   They are what the world says.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.800]   So when John speaks of the world,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.000]   he's speaking of the systems and attitudes
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.760]   predominantly brought on by our culture and our society.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.880]   It's the way that our society sees and perceives things.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.040]   It's not evil, per se.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.940]   It's not bad, even.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.760]   It's the way it is.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.920]   It becomes the norm.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.680]   It's our default way of operating.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.240]   It's just the way that we go.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.920]   In this whole passage,
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.320]   John gives us all these ideas of the world,
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.040]   but then he interjects,
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.600]   and he's actually changing the direction of everything
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.660]   by introducing the Father.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.580]   He's saying, yes, there's a way, there's a default system.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.160]   There are norms, there's culture,
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.000]   there's society that tells you how to live
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.160]   and what to do and what to believe
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.600]   and what your priorities should be,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.060]   but there's also another way.
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.560]   There's also the way of the Father.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.680]   There's also a different way.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.600]   Much like when he speaks of the world,
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.840]   John refers to the Father.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.840]   He's primarily speaking about how God and kingdom values
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.200]   can shape the way that we see the world.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.400]   And all that happens because Christ comes into the world
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.860]   and reveals to us both who God is,
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.440]   the heart of God, the nature of God, who we are.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.480]   It's based off of Christ's revelation.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.000]   So in Christ, we have a tangible and clear picture
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.480]   of the Father, of the way of the Father.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.400]   By this, Christ ends up shaping how we see things,
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.000]   how we process information.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.560]   He defines for us what is right and what is good
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.400]   and what is wrong.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.480]   Christ becomes the lens by which we evaluate
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.760]   the experiences in our world
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.400]   if we are subscribed to this way of the Father.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.900]   Christ shapes and molds our thinking.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.980]   So when John speaks of the Father,
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.000]   he's speaking of the authority that we have given Christ
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.500]   to decide for us what is true and what is right,
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:05.660]   what is important, what is priority, and what is good.
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.240]   So what does the option of Christ say?
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.560]   Christ shows us how to live.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.520]   He tells us to love God with all your heart
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.960]   and all your mind and all your soul and all your strength
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.900]   and to love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.400]   Really good things, nobody's gonna say no to that.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.120]   Christ says he welcomes those who are vulnerable.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.320]   He says, "Blessed are the poor in spirit."
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.280]   This was revolutionary when it was spoken.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.400]   "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness."
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.480]   Perhaps my favorite one.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.820]   "Blessed are you when you are persecuted falsely."
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.180]   Blessed are the victims?
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.020]   Ooh.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.520]   Christ redefines our strength.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.320]   He says, "Blessed are the meek.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.180]   "Seek justice for the marginalized
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.600]   "and take care of the widow and the orphan.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.880]   "Care for the alien and the stranger in your land."
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.000]   He says, "Give without expecting a return."
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.360]   I think the parable he says,
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.800]   "When your right hand is giving,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.600]   "make sure your left hand doesn't know what's happening."
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.420]   Right?
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.280]   He says, "Yeah, love your neighbor,
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.840]   "but get this, love your enemy."
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.980]   Christ says, "Turn the other cheek
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.320]   "and maybe go the extra mile."
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.320]   Not just if someone requires you to go a mile with them,
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.620]   go a mile further.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.680]   Christ defines, redefines our strength.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.240]   Christ purifies our heart.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.200]   He says, "Blessed are the pure in hearts.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.660]   "Do good deeds so that your Father will be glorified.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.380]   "Beware of practicing your righteousness
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.400]   "in front of other people.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.060]   "Store up treasures not here on earth, but in heaven.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.640]   "Humble yourself before the Lord."
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.280]   And lastly, Christ is our source.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.640]   He will tell us things like this.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.280]   "Do not be anxious.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.960]   "Ask God for what you need.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.720]   "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done."
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.800]   If God clothed the lilies of the field,
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.040]   how much more would He clothe you?
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.440]   If God would feed the birds of the air,
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.600]   how much more would He feed you?
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.480]   He tells us that if you have to ask, it'll be given.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.700]   "Every good and perfect gift comes from the Father above.
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.940]   "The heart is deceitful above all else.
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.280]   "Man might plan his way,
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.880]   "but it's the Lord that directs his steps."
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.400]   See, these sayings and beliefs,
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.360]   this is the way of the Father.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.280]   They reflect the heart of God.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.080]   In the intimate journey of transformation,
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.040]   He takes His followers on, those who are submitted to Him.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.920]   We become shaped and molded by the way of the Father.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.080]   So when John speaks of the Father, it's these systems.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.880]   It's these attitudes predominantly brought on by Christ
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.500]   at the center of our lives.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.960]   So with an understanding of the way of the world,
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.720]   culture, society, things that are just okay,
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.880]   not bad, not good, just are, and the way of the Father,
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.800]   John now turns our attention to understand
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.760]   the relationship between the two,
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.960]   and what we, who we are to be,
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.160]   relating to the world and to the Father.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.980]   John would say this,
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.980]   "Do not love the world or anything in the world."
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:26.040]   I'll say that again, 'cause that's a really big statement.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.860]   "Do not love the world or anything in the world."
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.280]   If anyone loves the world,
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.680]   love for the Father is not in them.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.640]   Let me put this in sermon series language for us
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.080]   so we stay quite relevant.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.220]   "Do not find your intimacy with the world."
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:48.280]   You cannot afford to find your intimacy with the world
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.640]   if the love of the Father is meant to be evident in you.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.480]   All right?
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.720]   [coughing]
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.160]   John divides us two different ways, two different paths.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.840]   He separates them, and I think the temptation for us
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   is a lot more subtle than this text.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.880]   I think whenever we hear about the world or idols,
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.440]   we're like, "Okay, I'm not bound on idols.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.840]   "I'm not worshiping the world, I'm okay."
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.080]   And I think for most of us, most mornings,
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.120]   we don't wake up, pop out of bed, alarm clock goes off,
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.420]   and we're like, "All right, what am I gonna do today?
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.120]   "Let's worship the world."
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.160]   I don't think that's on anyone's agenda, right?
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.540]   No one wakes up like, "How can I love the world?
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.840]   "How can I put God on the shelf?
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.020]   "How can I forget about Christ?
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.040]   "How can I just worship the world
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.120]   "and myself and myself and the world?"
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.000]   I think it's actually significantly more subtle,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.680]   therefore more dangerous than that.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.880]   I think for a lot of us, and please don't miss this,
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.600]   for a lot of us, we wanna love Jesus.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.480]   We wanna do the right thing.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.840]   We wanna be intimate with Jesus.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.560]   We wanna have Jesus.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:47.480]   But if we're honest, we also wanna sprinkle
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.800]   a little bit of the world on there.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.220]   We also want some of the things that the world offers,
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.460]   some of society's values, some of society's preferences.
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.580]   So perhaps we subscribe quite a lot
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.720]   to the way that the world operates.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.080]   And that's the tricky thing.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.820]   We want the, "I buy Jesus and get a side of the world,"
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.700]   the combo meal, the buy one, get one free concept.
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.100]   And John is saying, "It doesn't work that way.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.800]   "It cannot work that way."
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.140]   Those two things, you can't have 'em both.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.660]   You can't be walking towards Jesus,
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.060]   but also walking towards the world, right?
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.400]   It's like this lamp.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:29.980]   It's either on or it's off.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.060]   It can't be on/off.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:32.900]   Doesn't exist, right?
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.180]   So I can, if I pull harder, it'll be, no, no, it's still on.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.900]   If I pull it again, it's still off.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.500]   There's no middle ground.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.300]   There's no fence to sit on.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.780]   And if we're honest with ourselves,
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.180]   most of us, if we evaluate where we are, are fence sitters.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.860]   We're trying to get some Jesus
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.920]   and we're trying to come to church,
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.980]   but also when we go through Monday to Friday,
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.500]   where some of our practices might be a bit dodgy
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.300]   and some of the preferences that we have
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.340]   may be a bit cutthroat
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.420]   and we might not really love our neighbor.
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.340]   We might tolerate them
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.380]   and we definitely don't love our enemies.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:07.300]   The two things kind of don't work.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.780]   They can't go together.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.100]   If your intimacy, I'll put it this way,
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.940]   it's a dichotomous scale, right?
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.260]   So the more you choose to be intimate
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.780]   with the things of the Father,
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.220]   if you walk towards the Father in your intimacy,
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.460]   you're actually walking away from the things of the world.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.180]   Same vice versa.
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.280]   If we walk towards the world in our intimacy,
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.940]   we're walking away from the things of the Father.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.580]   You can't do them both.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.420]   Now here's the thing.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.940]   I don't want to come across as someone who is condoning,
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.040]   you know, just be holy, live in your holy house
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.040]   on top of the hill and talk to no one
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.900]   and don't have Instagram and don't have friends
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.180]   and don't drive a car and don't have electricity.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.580]   And I'm not saying that.
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.780]   That's actually not what the scripture is saying, right?
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:56.780]   To love God and to choose to walk closer to God,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.840]   what it means is that these things control you less.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.620]   These things own you less.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.820]   They serve you, you don't serve them.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.280]   There's a freedom that we step into
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.900]   when we choose to walk in intimacy with God
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.780]   and allow the things of the world,
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.060]   we're just saying it, the cross before me,
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.580]   the what behind me, the world behind me, right?
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.900]   It's this way of engaging with God
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.820]   where we are choosing to walk closer to him
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.820]   and leaving certain things behind by choice, by choice.
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.940]   The reality is if we aren't careful,
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.740]   we can allow culture and present philosophies
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.480]   and pseudo psychology and social norms
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.020]   to govern the way that we see things
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.100]   and practice life.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.500]   If our aim and our chief satisfaction
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.900]   is in satisfying ourselves,
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.820]   if we give society the ultimate authority
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.960]   to define what is right and what is wrong, what is good,
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.220]   then we are in fact substituting intimacy with Christ
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.940]   for intimacy with the lust of the flesh,
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.380]   intimacy with the lust of the eyes,
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.280]   intimacy with the pride of life.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.140]   And John makes it very clear.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.620]   He goes, "These things do not come from the Father,
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.740]   "but from the world.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.220]   "And the world and its desires will pass away.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:19.220]   "But whosoever will do the will of the Father
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.500]   "lives forever."
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.620]   Incompatible, the two things don't mix.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.220]   Think of oil and water.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.420]   The values of love others first
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.840]   and humble yourself before God
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.700]   and blessed are the poor and the meek
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.580]   don't really work that well in the marketplace, right?
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.500]   It's kind of a hard thing to do.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.460]   God's ways are different.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.380]   His people therefore must be different.
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.260]   The values and methods of Christ
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.700]   when compared to the world, they cannot coexist.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.620]   There is no blend of them.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.780]   I know I'm beating that to a pulp,
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.220]   but I just gotta make that really clear.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.860]   And I guess the question we have to ask ourselves is why?
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.920]   Why can't I have a little bit of Jesus
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.180]   and a little bit of world?
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.360]   Why do they not work out that way?
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.300]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.660]   God is a jealous God.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.900]   There's a place in your heart for God.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.740]   There's a place you were created for him,
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.940]   by him, through him.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.380]   You have life because of him.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:21.380]   And so if he moves into your life, he takes up all of it.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.660]   There is no space for anyone else.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.740]   Jesus is not hoping to have a roommate in your heart
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.260]   that he shares with.
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.500]   It's either Jesus or it's the other person, right?
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.980]   He's too big for that.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.180]   James chapter four, the message version
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.300]   reads it really, really well.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.480]   I'm just gonna read it to you.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.580]   So take a minute.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.700]   It's not gonna be on the screen.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.540]   You have to really listen.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.180]   And it says like this.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.380]   You are cheating on God if all you want is your way,
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.980]   flirting with the world every chance you get.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.080]   You end up as enemies of God and his ways.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.620]   And do you suppose God doesn't care?
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:01.660]   The proverb has it that he is a fiercely jealous lover.
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.300]   And this is the best part.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.140]   And what he gives, what he offers,
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.820]   the way of the father is far better
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.680]   than anything else you'll ever find.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.820]   That's the kicker.
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.500]   That's the kicker.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.500]   Our tendency is pairing.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.340]   It's pairing.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.500]   It's Christ and something.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.600]   Christ and intimacy with this.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.860]   Christ and fill in the blanks.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.860]   So Christ and success maybe for some of us.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.380]   Christ and validation.
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.380]   Christ and relevance.
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.520]   Christ and creativity.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.800]   Christ and security.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.740]   Christ and blessings.
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:42.120]   Christ and, but I think it's supposed to be Christ alone.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.760]   Christ alone, not Christ and stuff.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.280]   Christ and things.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:52.600]   We will find ourselves settling for the idea of Jesus
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.660]   if we are trying to pair him with something,
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.420]   never really getting to him itself.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.180]   And so I think when you look at a message like this,
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.700]   I'm oftentimes cautious.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.320]   I don't ever wanna come across as,
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.520]   Promise has read all this stuff
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.740]   and his life is like perfect now,
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.540]   so he's telling you guys, get your act together.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.520]   That's not the case.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.620]   Couldn't be further from the truth.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.960]   I am just as broken as everyone else.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.160]   So I wanted to share because Christ and fill in the blank
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.400]   can be maybe too broad for you.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.320]   So let me share what it is for me.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.600]   What is my Christ and that I struggle with every single day?
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.100]   For me, it's Christ and control.
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.680]   I wanna control my life.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.400]   I wanna have a say in what I do.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.980]   I wanna, I was telling Tony,
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.620]   I like to plan out what I'm gonna do every decade.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.620]   At 30, I'm gonna have a master's and have my first kid.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.900]   In my 40s, I'm gonna start my PhD.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.160]   In my 50s, I'm gonna be a professor.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.500]   In my 60s, I'm gonna write a book.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.940]   Like I have it all planned out.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.780]   I've written it out.
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.360]   It's a beautiful chart, it's an Excel sheet.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.260]   I know what to do.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.900]   Christ and controls for me.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.740]   But this is the reason
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.760]   because I don't wanna depend on nobody else.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.020]   Right, I have a sad story too.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.760]   I came from a messed up situation too.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.600]   I know what it's like to not have anything.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.820]   I wanna make sure I earn enough.
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.660]   So it's me having to give myself the independence
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.700]   to make sure I earn enough,
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.720]   to make sure I have the right job,
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.300]   to make sure that my kids are fed
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.980]   and make sure my wife goes without need.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.100]   I struggle with letting God have control.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.420]   And some of my closest friends will tell you
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.660]   that's the one thing they pray for me all the time.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:18.500]   I just can't let it go.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.500]   I really, really struggle.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.540]   For me, it's always pairing the idea of Christ.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.700]   I wanna be a good Christian.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.980]   I wanna be intimate with God.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.900]   But also I really wanna have control
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.220]   and have a say in how things turn out
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.220]   and make sure my life isn't a complete mess.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.500]   I pair them together and Christ has been convicting me
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.700]   that rather than pairing my control with Christ,
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.200]   I'm supposed to be submitting,
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:45.120]   submitting my control to Christ.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.900]   This is the thing, these objects,
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.660]   these concepts aren't bad in and of themselves.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.740]   God didn't just create these things
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.680]   and said it's just a bunch of bad things in the world.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.760]   No, there's a lot of good out here.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.300]   But the problem that we potentially have,
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.460]   the tendency that we have is to pair together things
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.620]   when things are supposed to be submitted.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:12.260]   And so I ask you, but that's my story, that's my reality.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.660]   And maybe it's same for some of you, but what is it?
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.180]   What are the things, if you were to really ask yourself,
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.900]   what am I pairing with Jesus
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.660]   that I'm supposed to be submitting to Jesus?
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.660]   What good is there out there that I like
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:28.500]   that I've actually accidentally put at the same level
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.340]   or made an idol of or become more intimate with?
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.180]   And it's pushing out Jesus day in and day out.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.380]   It is wearing me out.
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.580]   It is exhausting to try and juggle both
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.200]   because it's not possible.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:45.260]   For some of us, not on scripts,
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.000]   for some of us, it's within relationships.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.820]   And I really, I prayed about it this morning.
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.500]   I really felt I was supposed to share it at the 11 o'clock,
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.940]   so bear with me.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.900]   If there is a relationship in your life
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.260]   where you are putting that person
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.780]   at the same level of Jesus,
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.000]   let me explain why it doesn't work.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.700]   Because only God can satisfy fully.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.620]   Only God can fulfill.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.380]   So what we end up doing isn't just hurting ourselves.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.760]   We actually end up hurting that person.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.200]   We put God-like expectations on them to satisfy
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.780]   and make us feel or make us be a certain way
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.580]   when that can only be found in God.
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:25.400]   And that's not a rebuke.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.240]   That's clarity.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.700]   All right?
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.580]   The Father reveals these things that we might change,
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.820]   that we might turn away.
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.380]   So if that is you, I ask you to wrestle with it for a bit.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.220]   You know, what is it?
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.040]   Maybe that's not you.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.860]   Maybe it's something else.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.580]   But we all have this temptation,
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.260]   and that ends up thwarting our intimacy
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.780]   away from walking closely with Christ
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:50.020]   and instead being intimate with other things.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.460]   So I recognize this is a challenging,
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.800]   not even challenging,
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.780]   it's a very black and white sermon.
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.860]   Very strong worded, maybe.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.860]   So I never wanna end on a negative.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.040]   So I wanna offer us some thoughts, some ways,
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.340]   because the scriptures are so good.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.660]   Like, God doesn't just tell us,
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.420]   "Oh, don't do this," and then like disappears.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.380]   He actually leads us to a place
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.100]   of greater intimacy with him.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.320]   So I wanna provide us two, I won't say simple,
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.500]   but hopefully simple to remember, steps.
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.160]   Some two things that we can do
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.540]   that will help us better choose
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.780]   where we're gonna be intimate,
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.380]   who we're gonna be intimate with.
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.620]   Is that okay?
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.680]   First thing is this.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.220]   It begins by recognizing transformation over conformity.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.580]   There's a passage in Romans 12
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.340]   that tells us not to conform
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.740]   to the patterns of this world.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.020]   The patterns, the ideas, the systems,
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.220]   the structures, the way that the world operates.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.700]   To not conform to that,
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.380]   but through the renewing of our minds
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.340]   to then be transformed.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.400]   The renewing of our minds.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.660]   Do not conform to the world.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.880]   Live in the world, be in the world.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.760]   Don't be of the world.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.560]   That's what that verse is saying.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.680]   My second thing is this.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.800]   I share a quick story before I tell you this point.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.000]   Last Sunday, I was listening to Pastor Andrew preach,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.040]   and I was like, he got to his,
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.000]   I don't know, his deliverables or his action points, right?
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.080]   'Cause every good pastor has like an action point.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.520]   And one of his action points was,
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.000]   my favorite passage in scripture from Matthew chapter six.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.880]   It's the idea of seeking first the kingdom.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.360]   And I was so annoyed knowing that's what I'm after.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.400]   I'm like, Andrew, you stole my point for next week.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.240]   He laughed and he hugged me.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.160]   He goes, preach it anyways.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.280]   Here's the thing.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.680]   We're not saying it twice because we just want to repeat it.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.380]   We're saying it twice because we want you to actually do it.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.320]   Like this is super important.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.640]   The idea of God-centered priorities
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.540]   will change everything for us.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.760]   It will change everything for us.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.180]   Matthew tells us to seek first, first, the first thing,
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.880]   the most important thing, the thing of most value,
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.400]   the thing of highest worth.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.920]   Seek first his kingdom.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.000]   He's defining for us what we should think
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.880]   and how we should believe and how we should live.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.760]   Seek first the kingdom.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.720]   And he doesn't say ignore everything else.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.620]   He doesn't say, oh, well, we'll see what happens.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.920]   Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.480]   And all these things.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.260]   Where promises kids go to school,
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.600]   how much money is in promises account,
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.540]   promises wife and family being in America,
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.160]   but me living in Hong Kong and missing Christmas
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.300]   for 10 years in a row.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.760]   All the things that are hard.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.920]   He says, seek first my kingdom.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.260]   Seek first my kingdom promise
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.180]   and I will take care of everything else.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.760]   He doesn't tell me how he's gonna do it.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.600]   He doesn't say here are my four steps.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.720]   Here's a PowerPoint, go look at it.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.800]   But he invites me to trust him.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.120]   And in that invitation of trust is perhaps
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.320]   a beautiful invitation to intimacy with God.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.600]   Seek first his kingdom.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.120]   I know there's a lot to process.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.940]   I know there's a lot of things in here,
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.080]   but I really want us to, I guess,
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.360]   leave today encouraged and hopeful.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:13.280]   Because if we grasp what intimacy is,
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.800]   if we can fall in love with the idea of being connected,
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.200]   being aligned, being in a God who speaks,
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.560]   who listens, who walks with you through every trial
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.880]   and who does not give you temptations,
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.420]   you cannot handle, who is your ever present help,
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.100]   who is your rock and your strong tower,
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.000]   who is the rock of your salvation,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.400]   if we can understand intimacy with that,
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.380]   I believe it'll make us rethink our allegiances.
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.760]   If we can know that intimacy with God
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.200]   means I can choose peace.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.360]   I don't have to worry about the things.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.840]   He actually tells me don't worry about it at all.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.000]   Don't be anxious for anything.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.680]   Two different places, Matthew and James,
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.800]   made it real clear, don't be anxious.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.200]   Just leave it up to him.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.840]   Intimacy with God, choosing intimacy with God.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.200]   Because the world will say worry about it,
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.880]   plan, plan, plan, get your spreadsheets,
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.000]   do your homework, prepare yourself, prepare yourself.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.540]   God's saying don't be anxious.
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.520]   To be a Christian means to walk through this
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.640]   without anxiety, right?
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.540]   To live and there's things happening,
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.640]   but to not be shaken.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.000]   Because our house isn't built on the sand.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.200]   It's not built on what is important and popular in 2024,
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.840]   that'll probably be different in 2025
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.840]   and different in 2028.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.720]   It's not based off of popular psychology
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.300]   or pseudo psychology or whatever magazine we're reading,
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.160]   whatever the news tells us,
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.880]   because our hope is built on Christ
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.000]   and he's an unshakable rock.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.800]   That position is available for you.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   This is a,
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.540]   (sighs)
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.880]   this passage is a call for us to come back.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.060]   It's a call for us to recognize that we're human,
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.040]   we made mistakes, it's okay, but there's a way back.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.560]   So as the band comes up, I want to end with the reality
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.880]   of one of my favorite passages,
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.760]   one of my favorite parables in scripture.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.060]   It's the parable of the two sons, right?
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.420]   I think it was somewhat familiar to some of us,
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:08.380]   but the idea is that these two sons have a father.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.860]   One son gets his inheritance early, dips out,
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.920]   and he runs to the world.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.520]   How fitting, fits right in.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.920]   It's almost like I planned it.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.620]   He goes out to the world and he squanders his wealth
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.180]   and he does his thing and he lives his life.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.700]   And let's say he makes quite a few mistakes
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.160]   to where he's dirt poor, can't eat, has nowhere to sleep.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.300]   He's messed it up and the thought goes
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.540]   through his head one day,
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.260]   rather than living here in the pigsty
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.540]   and just being cold and dirty and hungry and not clothed,
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.940]   maybe I can go back to my father
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.280]   and maybe he will at least allow me to be a servant
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.220]   in his house and take care of like the cattle or something.
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.940]   And so he musters up the courage to go back to his father.
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.420]   And on his way to his father, his father sees him,
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.860]   and perhaps one of the most beautiful things,
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:53.260]   he disrobes so that there is nothing holding him back,
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.060]   nothing resisting him from sprinting
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.780]   to his son that he loves.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.740]   It doesn't matter that he's messed up.
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:03.620]   It doesn't matter that he's chosen the world over the father.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.540]   The father drops everything.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.620]   He runs and he hugs him and he welcomes him.
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.860]   He doesn't reject him.
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.620]   Doesn't say you dirty sinner.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.300]   He welcomes him in.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.740]   He loves him.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.220]   It's such a story of love.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.900]   He takes his coat and he puts it on him.
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.220]   He takes his ring and puts it back on him
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.940]   to let him know that you're not just gonna be
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.000]   someone taking care of my cattle.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.180]   No, you're my family.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.940]   You're with me.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.860]   I still wanna be intimate with you.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.860]   And perhaps there are some of us who are curious
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.820]   about what that road looks like back to the father.
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.500]   Can I just encourage you that the father's arms
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.940]   are open wide, that he's a father that welcomes us back.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.040]   He welcomes the vulnerable.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.460]   Says that if we are faithful enough to confess our sins,
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.700]   he is faithful and just to forgive us and restore us.
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.660]   We kept singing he makes all things new.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.660]   He makes, we wrote that on purpose, y'all.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.500]   Like that is the truth of who he is.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.700]   He will make you new, but will you be open?
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.100]   Will you be open?
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.820]   And so I wanna pray for us.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.980]   So if we can all just go ahead and stand.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.820]   We'll just take a moment
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.020]   and we will just come to the father together.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:27.460]   If this message hits anything for you,
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.020]   whether it's about priorities or about allegiances
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.620]   or about your intimacy or about the pairing,
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.400]   can I just ask you to open your hands?
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.220]   As a symbol, not for me, not for your neighbor,
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.780]   but this is a moment between you and God.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.820]   If there's something here that you feel like
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.280]   I need to do with God, I need to speak with God,
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.780]   just open your hands.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:54.380]   And Holy Spirit, as we sit here under your word,
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.540]   under your truth and your clarity,
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.960]   but also under your grace and forgiveness,
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.940]   God, we open our hands symbolically to say
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.340]   that we've messed up, that there's been moments,
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.820]   there are things that vie for our affections
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:08.940]   and our intentions.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:13.020]   We open our hands to say, God, we're open.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.820]   Could you please come?
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.020]   Would you please enter?
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.980]   Would you please come to meet us?
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.660]   We know that your arms are open, Father.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.560]   We know that the road back to you is one
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.180]   where you welcome us and that you love us,
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.140]   that you call us your own,
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.260]   that you call us sons and daughters, your family.
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.980]   God, so I just pray against any lie
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.180]   that's in anyone's head now.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.020]   Any voice that says, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.740]   Will God actually accept you?
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.480]   Will God actually respond to you?
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.720]   Any seeds of doubt that are flowing through this place,
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.040]   we rebuke them.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.020]   But instead we speak your truth, we speak your grace,
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.740]   we speak your mercies that are new.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.340]   Every single morning, we speak your steadfast love
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.980]   over your people that leads us back
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.560]   to a place of intimacy with you.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.460]   And God, Holy Spirit, would you begin to remind us
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:07.460]   and show us what it means to be intimate
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.540]   with the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.620]   the creators of us?
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:15.100]   God, would you draw us in?
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.340]   Would you hold us close?
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.060]   Would you give us the fortitude and the courage
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.100]   to continue taking a step towards you,
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.100]   forsaking everything else?
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:28.940]   Because you are better, because you are better.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.340]   We give you glory for this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.760]   (soft music)
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.340]   (gentle music)
