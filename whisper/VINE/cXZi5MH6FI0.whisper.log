[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   In Jesus name.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.120]   Everyone says?
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.120]   Amen.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.920]   Hey, can we thank our worship team as always?
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.960]   So good.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.960]   Have a seat.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.320]   I want to say particularly a warm welcome to everybody at the two o'clock service.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.960]   It's great to have you here together.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.920]   I'm sorry that I'm not with you in person today.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.120]   I'm currently on a plane flying to Singapore where I'm going to be teaching at a conference
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.120]   there all week.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.560]   So I couldn't actually physically be with you, but you're tuning into this and we're
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.880]   so glad that you're with us and I pray that even though you're watching this on a screen
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.280]   right now, that God will speak to you and that you'll hear the Holy Spirit challenging
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.080]   you in the areas that he has for you today.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.560]   So it's great that you're with us and welcome everybody who's here for the first time.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.120]   If you've never been to the Vine before, my name's Andrew.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.160]   I'm one of the pastors and it's grateful.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.160]   We're so grateful.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160]   Even on a rainy day, a rainy day.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.640]   I am flying off to Singapore this afternoon.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.640]   It's so funny.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.400]   I like checked the weather because I'm like, I need to get away from this crazy rain.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.760]   Like I'm so tired of it.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760]   I want to go somewhere.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.040]   I'm going to see some sun.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.800]   And I looked at the weather, the place that I'm going to be doing this conference in and
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.680]   it's raining there.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.080]   So praise the Lord Jesus.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.120]   So we continue our series in Ephesus today in Ephesians, the book.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.400]   And we come to a passage that is very, very important to us as a church, very important
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.560]   to me as your pastor here.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.000]   We come to what really is the central passage to I think Paul's whole book.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.800]   It's pretty much in the center of his book, but it's also the central passage to us and
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.200]   our vision here at the Vine.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.400]   And if you've been coming to the Vine, and there's people in this room that have been
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.120]   coming to the Vine for 10, 20, 20 plus years.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.840]   My prayer today is that you'll hear something fresh out of the passage that perhaps you've
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.480]   heard us teach on a few times before.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.800]   But if you're relatively new here at the Vine, and to be honest with you, we've just done
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.680]   a survey in the last month or so to ask about who you are.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.960]   And we know that many of you here have only been a part of this church for say one year,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.720]   two years, or even less than that.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.440]   So we know that there's a lot of relatively new people.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.560]   You may not have heard us speak about what is the central sort of heartbeat of our vision,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.000]   why we do what we do as a church.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.600]   And more than that, what our heart is for you.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.200]   If you align to the Vine Church, and if you say that the Vine Church is your home church,
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.080]   then everything I'm going to speak about over the next 30 minutes is specifically about
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.080]   you.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.520]   It's about you, it's about your life, it's about what the Holy Spirit wants for you,
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.920]   because if this is your home church, what I'm sharing is the heart of everything that
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.560]   we do here as a church.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.180]   And the catalyst to this heart started back in around about March of 2013.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.160]   It was about nine months or so before I took over here as senior pastor in November of
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160]   2013.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.240]   In March 2013, I was praying, and if I'm honest with you, I was feeling very overwhelmed,
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.960]   I was feeling very nervous.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.800]   I had imposter syndrome.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.160]   We had two phenomenal founding pastors here at the Vine, John and Tony, that had done
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.280]   such an incredible job of birthing and growing a church.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.240]   And I was feeling, if I'm honest, the weight of picking up at a relatively young age at
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.920]   the time, I was relatively younger at the time, picking up a large church and trying
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.000]   to lead it off the back of two gentlemen that had led it so beautifully and so wonderfully.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So in all of those insecurities and that kind of sense of pressure, I went to God and I
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.440]   was just praying, I was like, "God, look, I just want to understand your heart for these
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.600]   people in the season that's ahead.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.920]   Because if I can understand your heart for them, then I think I can kind of get over
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.280]   myself and my inadequacies that I'm sensing and lean into what your heart is for these
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.280]   people."
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.600]   And as I was praying that, I heard God speak and He spoke, perhaps what I would say is
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.940]   the clearest He's ever spoken to me.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.680]   It would probably be a lie to tell you that I've heard the audible voice of God.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.040]   I don't know what the audible voice of God is.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.160]   But this was probably one of the times in my life where I've heard Him speak into my
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.700]   soul.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.480]   His Word just kind of hit me deeply in who I am.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.480]   Here's what He said, it was very simple.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.200]   He said, "Andrew, I don't want you to grow a big church, I want you to grow big people."
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.940]   And that shift changed everything for me.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.520]   Because I was so anxious about taking on a large institution, a large church, and having
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.600]   to maybe grow that church even bigger.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.560]   And God shifted it and He said, "Andrew, forget about the size of things, forget about the
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.360]   institution of it.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.020]   What I want you to focus on is every single individual and my desire for them to grow
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.120]   in their relationship with me.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.280]   I want you not to grow a big church, not that there's anything wrong with large churches,
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.400]   again, the vine over our three services is a relatively large church.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.840]   But I don't want you to focus on trying to grow an institution, I want you to grow people."
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.800]   And I have to tell you, that resonated so deeply in me because I sense that that's my
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.320]   passion.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.600]   That's everything that I want.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.680]   I want you, and you've heard us say this at the Vine, if you've been coming for any period
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.160]   of time, you've probably heard this before.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.720]   Whether you're here for two weeks, for two months, for two years, for two decades, I
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.880]   want you to grow in Christ Jesus.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.360]   I want you to get to the end of a week and feel like because of your connection to the
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.760]   people in this room, because you feel like you're a part of a gathered community in Hong
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.480]   Kong, that you feel like you know Jesus more, you're deeper in connection with Him, you're
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.560]   walking more faithfully, you have a boldness to share the gospel like you've never had
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.080]   before, you have a mindset to understand justice and the vulnerable and the marginalized and
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.120]   wanting to make a difference, that you're looking at your workplace and the sphere of
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.480]   influence that Christ has planted you in, and you're saying, "How can I use the gifts
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.640]   and the talents and the spiritual things that God has given me to work out in the very place
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.640]   that I am?"
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.200]   Because you've heard this before, church is not 90 minutes on a Sunday, church is the
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.360]   gathered group of people wherever that might happen.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.840]   That happens in the workplace.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.880]   It happens in schools and universities.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.000]   It happens with entrepreneurs.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.180]   It happens in families.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.680]   It happens in any place that someone who professes the name of Jesus is rooted and present.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.120]   Jesus is there and they can bring heaven to earth in that place.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.260]   And if there's anything that drives the heartbeat of the vine, it is that.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.440]   We love gathering together in these 90 minutes on a Sunday, but this is not the fullness
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.480]   of what church is about.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.520]   Church actually comes more alive when you wake up on a Monday and you get dressed and
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.280]   you go into your workplace and you spend the majority of your time with people who don't
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.200]   know Jesus.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.800]   I envy you.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.480]   I spend most of my time with Christians.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.600]   And I have to tell you, no, I won't go there.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.000]   You get to spend most of your time with people who don't believe and what a beautiful, wonderful
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   thing that is.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.440]   So our vision here at the Vine is simply this, growing big people.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.240]   Three words, that's it.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.400]   Very easy for everybody to remember, growing big people.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.720]   That's our desire, is that you would mature in your faith and that you would be so infused
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.160]   with the gospel, with understanding what that means through the life, death and resurrection
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.200]   of Jesus, through the birthing of the church and through the wonder of what it is to live
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.440]   reconciled with him, but also then to be in the ministry of reconciliation for others
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.160]   in the world that you're longing to grow and mature and deepen that relationship more and
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.600]   more as you go through life.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.280]   For me, that's what this is all about.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.160]   And I want you to hear this, we honestly believe here at the Vine that the local church is
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.520]   the hope of the world, the local church.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.440]   And again, by that, I don't mean a building or an institution or an organization.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.080]   I don't even mean services.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.280]   I mean you and me.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.840]   I mean our relationships.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.280]   I mean community.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.920]   I mean the gathered group of God's people together.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.060]   That is the hope of the world.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.060]   It's the hope of the world because God has always chosen in redemptive history right
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.400]   from the beginning of all things, from Genesis chapter four and then the calling of Abraham
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.140]   and the formation of Israel from Genesis chapter 12.
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.360]   What it's all been about is that God has said, "I'm going to reveal my character, my nature,
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.640]   my truth, my heart, my love through my gathered people."
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.560]   I mean that's what Israel was all about in the Old Testament.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.480]   And that's why God gathers them at Mount Sinai and pours out his heart to them in the law
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.760]   because he wants them to be this physical representation of his character.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.560]   That's what the gathered church is about.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.920]   It's why Jesus told them to stay in the upper room until he pours out his spirit so that
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.600]   they could be filled with that law that is no longer on a tablet of stone but is now
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.880]   written on the softness of their hearts by the spirit of Christ, the same spirit that
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.100]   raised Jesus from the dead, now given to them the birthing of the church so that they could
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.080]   then go out and represent the character and the heart and the passion and the saving grace
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.280]   of Christ Jesus to the world.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.200]   That's what it's always been about.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.960]   So if you want to know what the answer is to some of the greatest challenges that we're
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:12.840]   seeing in the world today, it is you and it is me, it is us, the church, the people of
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.680]   Christ.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.840]   And see this is really important.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.680]   The reason why our vision of growing big people is really important is because 91% of people
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.040]   in Hong Kong do not know Jesus.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.040]   You know that?
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.280]   That's the latest statistic.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:34.840]   91% of people in our city do not know Jesus, which means we have an awesome responsibility
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.760]   and an incredibly exciting...
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.800]   What other city would you want to live in than that?
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:47.520]   A city that desperately needs the very thing that sits in your heart, the very thing that
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.680]   has captured your life, the very thing that has transformed you and saved you and sets
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.240]   you free, the very thing that wakes you up in the morning with your heart beating faster
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.320]   to say, "I'm so grateful that I know Christ."
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.960]   91% of the people in our city do not have that experience, but they could through the
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.720]   church.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:14.280]   Not by trying to get everybody in here, but by trying to release all of us out there.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.920]   That's the river model vision here at The Vine.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.640]   That's why we're growing big people, but we have this idea of the river model where all
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.800]   of us has a spirit influence that we're rooted in, where we get to live out the beauty and
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.320]   the wonder of the things that we talk about here on a Sunday.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.400]   And that's important because what Christ wants for His church is that it would be His hands
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.000]   and feet in every aspect of society, in every part.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.280]   And in this room right now and over our three services, even in the two o'clock, you represent
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.480]   the beauty and the wonder of some aspect of Hong Kong society.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.080]   And what a powerful thing it is to think that the church is in the law firms, that the church
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.440]   is in the government, in the corridors of power, that the church is in the police force,
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.040]   that the church is in our universities and education institutions, that the church is
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:06.240]   almost everywhere in our society, hopefully bringing the love of Christ to that place.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.200]   See, the reason why this is important as well, the reason why we want to grow big people
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.400]   here is because a mature church is not easily shaken.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.280]   And I tell you what, the world is shaking right now.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.920]   With all of the economic challenges and the political challenges around the world, the
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.720]   world is more in war today than it has been five years ago, ten years ago.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.080]   The world is more at war, not just physically and violently as we see around in various
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.600]   different conflicts, but at war culturally with each other.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   It's never been more like that than ever right now.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.960]   And in the midst of that, wouldn't it be amazing if there was a presence of a group of people
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.380]   who despite the fact that everything else was shaking and everything else seems scary
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.280]   and overwhelming, there was a group of people who were rooted in something, grounded in
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.120]   something that was so sure and so strong to them, that despite the fact that they may
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.480]   also feel a bit of fear at times, that they may also sense that there is this change that's
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.840]   happening, they could say, "There is a rootedness that we can have, and I am not afraid because
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.720]   my hope is not here.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   My hope is in Christ.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.240]   And because my hope is in Christ, I have salvation.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.880]   I have a solid rock on which I'm building my life, and everything else can shake, but
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.880]   there is hope."
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.960]   I tell you, when you're living in a culture and a society and a city that is shaking like
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.320]   Hong Kong's is, people are looking for those who are secure.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   And they're thinking maybe that security is found in money.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.200]   And when the economy shakes, everybody gets overwhelmed and fearful.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.280]   Or maybe that security is found in some relationship.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:39.040]   If I could just get married or date somebody or find a hot girl that I've been looking
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.560]   for or the stable guy that I want, we think that's where our security will come.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.200]   And the church has the opportunity to stand up in the midst of all of those conversations
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   and say that there's only one place where true security comes, and that's outside of
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.340]   yourself in the one who's the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.920]   Which is why, when we're growing big people here at the Vine, we're doing it because a
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.040]   mature church can offer an alternative vision of life.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.840]   I tell you what, in the conversations that I have, I know I just told you that I spend
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.280]   most of my time with Christians, which I do.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.680]   But in the conversations I have with my non-Christian friends and the non-Christian community that
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   I have, I constantly hear this communication.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.640]   It's basically, I wonder if there's another way to live because the system is not working
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.640]   for us right now.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.240]   I tell you what, post-modernism has failed this world.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.840]   It had this great hope when it started, but it's failed people, and they've realized that.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.480]   Modernism, materialism failed us.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:38.040]   Actually the extreme polarizations of elements of culture, extreme liberalism is failing,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.320]   extreme conservatism, the right wing side of things, which has led to, in history, some
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.160]   really bad things, is failing.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.920]   And so in the midst of that, people are looking for an alternative way of life.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.400]   They are wanting, literally, to be awoken to the reality that there is another way to
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.720]   live that can bring hope and life and charity and kindness and goodness, and actually see
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.460]   the world come together more than to be driven apart like it seems at the moment.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.760]   And people are looking for where that alternative life is.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.200]   And if the church remains silent, people are going to look over our heads to something
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.760]   else.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.520]   And as we begin to speak up, and as we begin to mature, as we begin to grow in our relationship
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.760]   with Christ, we begin to hold forth and hold fast the Word of God in the world.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.580]   We begin to say, "This is a new way to live.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.720]   This is a way that you can know peace, where even though the world might be going crazy,
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:37.640]   there's a solidness to shalom, to peace, to reconciliation that you can know right here
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.640]   and right now."
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.760]   Could you imagine Hong Kong as a city who, in this shaking time, would look out to a
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:49.680]   church that was so rooted in its maturity in Christ that people were like, "I want to
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.920]   be a part of that."
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.920]   That's our vision.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.160]   I mean, that's really what Growing Big People is all about.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.360]   I think God is looking for that kind of church.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.680]   And I'm not saying that the Vine is that kind of church.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.680]   I'm saying that's the goal.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:12.040]   That's the challenge that Christ has placed upon us as a community here.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.000]   I think this is essentially the kind of church that God is looking for.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.120]   Let me read this to you.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.680]   Filled with people who are confident in what they believe, mature in their experience of
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   the kingdom and the works of God, literate in their understanding of His Word and its
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.900]   narrative, experienced in their healing and their restoration, skilled in their advocacy
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:36.960]   for justice, and planted with hope in the brokenness of the world.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.240]   That's a church I want to be a part of.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.880]   And again, by church, don't think Vine, institution.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.960]   Think a group of people who believe this and have dedicated sacrificially their life to
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.440]   living out this.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.880]   I think that's what Christ died for.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.360]   I think Christ did not die for an immature church.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.520]   Christ died for this kind of community.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.120]   And my heart, our heart as a leadership here at the Vine, if you call the Vine your home
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.720]   community, this is what we're hoping to go towards.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.360]   This is the goal that we're trying to attain to.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.560]   This is what we're trying to move together in.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:19.980]   And as we mature individually, we mature communally.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:26.520]   And I believe we take steps towards becoming a church like this that could truly, truly
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:33.440]   change that statistic from 91% who don't know Jesus to whatever percent, hopefully, we can
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.440]   get it to where they do.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.680]   Is anyone else excited about that?
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.680]   No?
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.680]   Okay.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.680]   That's great.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.120]   Now what I want to do is I want to show you how Paul, I think, places so much of what
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.480]   I've been talking about with you so far into this passage we're looking at today.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.000]   As we continue our series in Ephesians, we come to Ephesians 4, verses 11 to 16.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.320]   And this is Paul's growing big people moment.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.920]   This is him explaining to his church in Ephesus his heart for them to mature and to grow.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:13.600]   And not only does he explain the idea of it, he actually maps out a process in these verses
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.800]   by which his church could mature more.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.400]   And I love this because what I'm going to do is, after I read it, is I'm going to break
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   that down for you.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.560]   I'm actually going to show you the process that Paul provides for his church because
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.240]   what Paul is trying to do in Ephesus, we're trying to do here at the Vine.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.800]   It is to grow a church of mature believers for a purpose of trying to change the world.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.880]   And that was definitely Paul's heart as a pastor.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.040]   It's our heart here.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.880]   So let me read this to you from Ephesians 4, starting in verse 11.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.540]   It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, some
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:51.920]   to be pastors, and some to be teachers, to prepare God's people for works of service,
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:58.600]   so that the body of Christ may be built up in unity, built up until we reach unity in
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:03.560]   the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, and we become mature, attaining to
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.440]   the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.760]   Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.520]   there by every wind of teaching and by the cunningness and craftiness of people in their
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.680]   deceitful scheming.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:22.280]   No, instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Him who is
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.600]   the head, that is Christ.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:30.040]   From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:36.040]   itself up in love as each part does its work.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.800]   Paul has such a passion for his church in this moment because he wants them to see something
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.840]   that I think he felt they were failing to see up until this point.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.880]   He's just spent three chapters talking about what Christ has done in His grace in their
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.040]   lives, and we've unpacked that in this series so far.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.480]   But here in chapter four, he starts by saying, "I want you to live a life that is worthy
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.040]   of the calling you've received."
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.120]   Susanna beautifully unpacked that for us last week.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.080]   She challenged us to understand how we can walk in kindness and humility and goodness
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.640]   towards one another.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.040]   Now Paul's going to take this idea of what it is to live a life worthy of the calling
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:16.880]   you've received and show you how that works in the church, how there is this process of
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.560]   living a life that's truly worthy of that calling through maturity in Him.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.400]   And so I want to map this out for you.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.440]   The first thing he does is he says, "Look, there's three things that are central to the
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.060]   idea of maturing in a church.
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.960]   Any church that is going to seek to mature people, you need to understand that God has
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.320]   created three specific elements that work for that.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.760]   The first he talks about, which we've come in the modern church to call the five-fold
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.600]   ministry gifts, he just speaks about five types of giftings that have been placed in
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.800]   the church to help that church to grow.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.840]   He says apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.800]   These are not professional employees.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.040]   These are people within the church themselves that are walking and ministering and living
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.480]   in certain gifts that are for the maturity of the church itself.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.400]   Now, we don't have time today to unpack what those five different things are and the different
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.600]   nuances of each of them.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:22.760]   It suffice to say that God has taken care of the community of His church by gifting
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.960]   it with such a way that there is diversity, there is different ideas of those gifts, they
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:33.800]   bring different things to the table, but seen together in their totality, they're designed
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.680]   to help the church to grow.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.040]   They're designed to help the church to mature and to deepen in their faith.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:45.200]   And so every church should be thinking, "How do we have these five things at work amongst
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   us?"
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.080]   Again, they're not offices or they're not like titles.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:54.960]   These are gifts that are at work amongst us so that we might be able to do something.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.880]   And I'll explain what that do something is in a moment.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.360]   But notice how Paul writes it.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.480]   He says, "God has given some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be…"
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.680]   He doesn't say God has called.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.420]   He doesn't say God has made.
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.360]   He says God has given these gifts.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.760]   So the focus is not on the person.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.760]   Look at me.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.160]   The focus is on God gifting.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:23.520]   In other words, it is a movement of His grace into a church community so that church community
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.520]   can grow.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:31.280]   And because it's a gift, it's given in order to achieve and accomplish something.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.120]   And I'm going to explain about that in just a moment.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.680]   So the first element is there is these gifts that God has placed amongst us.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.880]   Now, the second element comes out in verse 15.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.920]   He says, "Now, speaking the truth in love."
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.120]   So Paul says, "Not only is it important to have these five common gifts at work in
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.120]   your body to make it mature, you also need to be speaking the truth in love."
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.120]   I love this.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.440]   Paul's saying a mature church is a church that doesn't shy away from the absolute
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.960]   truth of God.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.720]   The absolute truth of Scripture, the absolute truth of the gospel and the life, death, and
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   resurrection of Jesus.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:13.040]   As a church embeds itself in the truth and shares that truth, speaks that truth, encourages
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.720]   that truth amongst them, it then grows and it matures.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.440]   I love this.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.440]   Speaking the truth.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.760]   Now, this is really important because I think in the world today, particularly in our postmodern
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.520]   context, there's been attack on the idea of absolute truth.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.160]   And instead, it's all about subjective truth or relative truth.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.720]   And whatever that subjective truth or relative truth is for you, you should embrace that.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.800]   But it will be different for the subjective or relative truth for someone else.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.880]   And you can't judge anybody else's subjective truth.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.240]   And so what we've got now is a culture, even in our time right now, where you'll hear this
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.480]   phrase a lot, "Own your truth."
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.860]   Just own your truth.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.760]   It's good for you to own your truth, which basically means you can believe whatever you
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   want.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.000]   You can believe whatever you want and never the two shall meet.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.320]   And I tell you what, us Christians, we've embraced this.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.720]   I'm being honest.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.380]   We've embraced this.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.040]   This is how I think we so often are when we're around those that don't know Jesus.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.320]   We're like, "Well, I've got my faith and I want to respect their space.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.800]   And I have my faith.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.040]   I have my truth.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   They have their truth.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.440]   And we're just going to like..."
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.760]   I want you to know something really clearly.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.320]   You don't have my truth.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.520]   You have the truth.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.720]   Come on, church.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.180]   You don't have just, "This is my truth and that's something else over there."
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.080]   You have the absolute truth.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.580]   The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus is an absolute truth.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.160]   And Paul's saying the church matures when it doesn't shy away from the reality that
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.960]   there is an absolute truth, that there is something that the world revolves around,
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.760]   that there is a creator who's created this world and poured his heart and life into it
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.280]   and wants to have relationship with the people that he's created.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.720]   And the church embraces and is willing to speak up for the absolute truth of Scripture.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.320]   Paul says the church grows.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.520]   It matures.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.160]   The people there mature.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.600]   And it's a wonderful thing.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   Notice this though.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.560]   He qualifies it by saying, "In love."
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.120]   Which is another problem because the church over history hasn't done that.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.240]   They've taught the absolute truth, but sometimes not in love.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.880]   From a posture of judgment, from a posture of finger pointing, from a posture of, "You're
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.760]   not as good as us and you need to get better, so hear this truth."
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:33.960]   Paul said, "No, we don't shy away from the absolute truth that we're rooted in as Christians,
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:40.360]   but we do it, we share it, we speak it in love with one another and with those out there."
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.360]   It's done from a place of love.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.040]   And remember, he's just prayed a prayer to them at the end of chapter 3 where his pastoral
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.680]   prayer was all about, "I want you to be changed inside through your knowledge of the love
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.680]   of God.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.400]   I want you to know the height and the depth and the width and the length of that love.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.000]   And I want that love to so transform you that it will surpass your understanding and it
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.880]   will fill you with the fullness of God."
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.840]   He's just prayed passionately that they would know love.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:07.000]   Then he says, "Now speak the truth out of the overflow of the love that's in you."
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.080]   When you share the absolute truth of the gospel with someone from a place of love, you share
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.080]   it not from a idea of, "I need to judge this person because their behavior is bad."
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.880]   You share it from, "Man, I so long for this person to flourish and grow and be transformed
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:27.960]   because could you imagine the lawyer they could be if they actually believed in Christ?"
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.760]   You're looking at it from a completely different perspective because you want the person to
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.560]   grow and flourish and be the best that they can be and your heart's somewhat broken that
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.160]   they're not living in the way that God has created them to be, but you're not judging
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.160]   them.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.480]   You're sharing the truth in a place of love.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.040]   Paul says when that happens, you have a mature church.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:49.880]   An immature church shies away from absolute truth.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.160]   I know that's not a popular thing to say, so I'm going to say it again.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:59.280]   An immature church shies away from absolute truth, but a mature church is willing to stand
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.240]   on the truth of Scripture but do so in love.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.800]   The third thing he says is he says, "You've got to understand that Christ is the head
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.520]   of the church and we are his body."
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.840]   So he shares about there's an authority structure in the church.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.200]   Not an authority structure that's human made, an authority structure that comes with Christ
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   as the head.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.280]   All authority is in him.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.840]   He said this at the beginning in Ephesians chapter 1.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.000]   He said, "The will of God is that all things on heaven and earth would come under one person
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   that is Christ."
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.640]   So Christ is the ultimate authority, he says, but he gets, "We are his body.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   We get to be his body."
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.760]   And this is a beautiful thing because as the body of Christ, we get to be different parts.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.880]   Our differences are a good thing.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.600]   Our backgrounds and our talents and our gifts that are different from one another, they're
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.680]   all good things.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.480]   As we bring them together in this one body, we build each other up.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.480]   It's a beautiful thing.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   We grow in Christ.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.560]   We mature, he's basically saying.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.400]   And so this idea of being a body means not all of us are the head, not all of us are
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.080]   the hand, not all of us are the feet.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.120]   Some of us are this, some of that.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.520]   Some of us are even the spleen.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.440]   Nobody wants to be the spleen, but some of us in this room, you're the spleen.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.520]   That's the metaphor he uses in 1 Corinthians 12.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.840]   We're all different parts of the body, but together we make up this wonderful thing.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:17.360]   So Paul is saying a maturing church happens because there are servants that are there
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.360]   to serve.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:24.000]   There's revelation that is heard amongst us, and there is a community in which is developing
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.600]   in that space.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:31.160]   So servant-hearted leadership, revelation of God's truth, and a community of people
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.480]   working together is part of the journey of maturing the church.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.000]   And Paul is saying if those three things are not at work, you will fail to see a maturing
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   church.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.560]   And if those three things are not at work in your life, you will probably fail to mature
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.200]   yourself in the way that Christ would want you to mature.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.320]   Those three things are non-negotiables.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.320]   Helping so far?
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.320]   Thanks, Allison.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.960]   Actually, I just heard everybody at the two say yes.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   Thanks, two.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.960]   I appreciate you.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.960]   All right.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.380]   Now, look what happens next.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.520]   So he's just said, look, there's three elements.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.760]   He said these three elements work towards one goal.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.760]   Notice this.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.480]   He says, "So that they would prepare God's people for works of service."
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.160]   I love that.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.000]   Notice he doesn't say, "So that they would prepare God's people to come to church on
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Sunday."
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.520]   He doesn't say that they'll prepare God's people to feel better about themselves.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:27.920]   He says, "These things prepare God's people for what he describes works of service."
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:33.600]   So Paul's vision for a maturing church is not a church that's passive, a church that's
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.420]   active.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.360]   His vision for people that are a part of a church is not that they would come in and
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:45.120]   only receive, but that they would be actively doing and giving and working out there somewhere
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.680]   in the world.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.780]   His vision for a church that's maturing is not a church that's filled with people who
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:56.720]   are just here to consume, but a church that's filled with people that are dying to contribute.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.520]   Because all of these things, this idea of servant leadership, revelation, and community,
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.880]   they're all working towards preparing God's people for the works that God has for them
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.200]   to do.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.760]   The three things on this side are the things that we should be supplying to you here at
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.840]   the Vine as your leadership and how you should be supplying to one another, but it's to prepare
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.240]   you to go and do something.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   I think one way of thinking about it is this.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.920]   The servants in the church are to prepare the church so that the church could be the
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.560]   servants to the world.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.560]   Come on church, did you follow that?
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.280]   So the servant leadership within the church is to prepare the church to be the servant
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.240]   leaders of the world.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:41.320]   So you could be in your marketplace situation, in the law firm, in the school, in the university,
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.400]   wherever it is, the family, whatever, and you're there going, "How do I do this for
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.380]   the people around me?
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.480]   How do I serve?
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.800]   How do I share the gospel?
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.940]   How do I live up the character and the nature of Christ to the people around me?
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:59.840]   Because I have been equipped by my community together to be a work of service to the community
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.840]   I'm planted in.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:06.080]   That my sphere of influence, I'm the pastor to that sphere of influence, you should be
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   thinking.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:13.640]   I'm God's hands and feet to that place and I can make a difference because of my community
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.660]   of faith and how we're serving one another and working together.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:23.040]   We can be living out acts of service wherever it is that you're planted.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.960]   I think that's a glorious vision for church.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.840]   It's not about like, "Hey, let's all come in and contribute everything here," although
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.460]   we do need you to contribute things here, right?
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.760]   We need volunteers, we need our helpers, we need the worship team.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.240]   Everything that you see pretty much on a Sunday, most of it is run by volunteers.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.560]   Yeah, we need the help here, but really the heart that Paul has for the church is that
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.820]   it would be so equipped for the work that it has to do out there.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.720]   And that should inspire you.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.900]   That should fill you with a hunger to want to mature so that you can be a greater representation
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.360]   of Christ's hands and feet wherever it is that you might find yourself.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:00.320]   So Paul says all of this stuff, what it does as we prepare our works of service is that
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.220]   it brings unity together.
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.480]   We are built up, as the church he says, in unity.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   I love that.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.320]   In other words, everybody here, if we were actually living out the call of the gospel
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.480]   in whatever sphere of influence we are, our role amongst each other should be to cheer
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   each other on.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.440]   It should be to say, "Wow, did you hear what this person did in the law firm the other
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.440]   week?
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.440]   Amazing.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.900]   They were able to do this because they had this mindset of what justice was and the heart
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.940]   of God and justice.
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.940]   And they did that.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.940]   We want to cheer you on.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:29.940]   We want to say that was awesome.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.940]   It's great."
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.640]   Or, "Hey, do you know that this person who's the CEO of this massive company, they're really
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.640]   struggling right now.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.700]   They're under a lot of pressure.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.500]   We need to gather around as a church and pray for them and stand with them so that they
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.420]   can be all that Christ has called them to be in that place in this season."
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.980]   Or, "Hey, you know this single mother who's having to raise two kids and she's struggling
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.420]   to pay rent every week?
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:52.480]   Hey, come on, we should be gathering around and building unity together to help her and
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.200]   provide for her and do whatever we can to make sure she's the best mom to those kids
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.600]   that she could possibly be."
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.960]   Could you imagine a church who's doing all of this stuff so that they could see unity
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.160]   be built up amongst themselves?
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.700]   That's something people would want to be a part of.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:14.080]   And this unity, Paul says, he said, "We build up this unity in two very specific things."
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:21.960]   He said, "The unity is found in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God."
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.900]   Faith and the knowledge of the Son of God.
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.880]   This is what happens when unity is at work amongst us.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.600]   We have unity in faith and unity in knowledge.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.120]   Paul often brings faith and knowledge together when he's teaching.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.840]   And he does so because it's really important for him because these two things are slightly
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.440]   different emphasis for Paul.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.720]   Emphasis for Paul spoke mostly about our experience with God.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.360]   It spoke about our beliefs and our promises or understanding the promises of God and our
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.920]   trust in Him.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.160]   The faith element was the bits where we don't understand where we need faith.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.120]   Maybe we haven't got it all worked out in our mind so we have this faith to believe
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.980]   or faith to trust or faith to embrace the promises of God.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.760]   Even though perhaps we don't fully understand them at times or maybe we haven't felt them
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:11.720]   at times, we have this faith in us, he says, and we have this unity together in faith in
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   the Son of God.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.920]   But then he also says, "But it's also a knowledge."
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.980]   It's not all just about faith.
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:23.520]   It's also about being rooted in understanding, having wisdom, having good doctrine, understanding
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.320]   theology, understanding the Scriptures.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.680]   This side is also important, Paul is saying.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:33.320]   Our unity, if you're a maturing church, our unity if you're a maturing Christian, is that
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.640]   you have feet in both of those camps, that you have a balance between your faith in the
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.840]   Son of God and you have a balance with your understanding, your knowledge of the Son of
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.840]   God.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.560]   He's like, "You need to get both of those things in balance because if one of those
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:52.080]   things dominates more over the other, then you're going to be an immature church that's
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:57.280]   likely to be shaken by every whim of teaching that's going to come your way."
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.960]   We all know this, right?
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.280]   We all know those churches or those experiences where it's all built on just some spiritual
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.600]   dramatic experience, and yet it seems to lack the rootedness of Scripture.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.960]   And perhaps we've been in other churches at times where it's amazing the doctrinal understanding
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.600]   and teaching, and yet it seems like it's dead, that it's not alive, that there's no spirit
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.600]   involved.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:23.320]   And Paul's trying to teach the church where our unity comes, our maturity comes.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:27.160]   When we take both of those things and we embrace them and walk into them and find balance in
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.920]   them in our lives, here at the Vine we put it this way, we want you to be a spiritually
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.400]   intelligent Christian.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.680]   We want you to be so filled with the Spirit that you have those experiences of Christ.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.080]   You're gifted by the Spirit.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.360]   You know that the same Spirit in you is the one that raised Jesus from the dead.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.620]   You're praying for the sick.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.840]   You're looking for miracles.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.900]   You're expecting for that.
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.760]   We want that in you, but we also want you to know your word.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.080]   We want you to be rooted in Scripture.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.920]   We want you to understand theology.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.640]   We want you to know how the Bible works.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.400]   We want you to stand on that absolute truth and have that.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.520]   We want you to have both of those things at work in your life.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.960]   That's maturity, Paul says.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.960]   That's what it is to grow.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.540]   Are you still with me?
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:08.760]   So all of this reaches to the end of the point where he says this, and so we would become
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:14.720]   mature, and notice how he defines maturity, "attaining to the whole measure of the fullness
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.280]   of God."
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.280]   The whole measure of the full...
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.680]   Yeah, that's a good slide to take a photo of.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   Yep, everybody's taking a photo of that.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   That's nice.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.720]   Although, ha, ha, ha, ha, there's one more bit, so sorry.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:30.040]   We're going to have to take a photo again in a few minutes' time.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.600]   But I want you to see, he's saying, "We become mature, attaining to the whole measure of
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.880]   the fullness of Christ."
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:41.440]   His vision is that you wouldn't miss out on anything that Christ has for you and for the
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   church.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.280]   The fullness of Christ should be found in you and found in the church.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.720]   He's basically saying, "Look, Christ did not die so that you received a portion of His
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.320]   love.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.080]   Christ didn't die so that you would receive a portion of reconciliation, a portion of
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.080]   restoration."
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.520]   Paul's like, "No, a mature church and a mature person in Christ is someone who understands
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.880]   that they are receiving the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.640]   We don't do the vines so that you would get a half measure."
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:17.280]   I mean, if that was our focus, then we may as well just wrap up and go home.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:23.160]   We do this because we want you to sense the wholeness of His love, the wholeness of restoration,
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.800]   the wholeness of your healing.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.580]   Whatever brokenness that you're with, whatever addiction you're struggling with, whatever
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.520]   overwhelming fears in your workplace, whatever it is, divorce that you're struggling with
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:38.320]   in your marriage, a breakdown in a relationship, whatever it is, we want the wholeness of Christ
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.440]   for you in those areas.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.640]   So that you would feel fully alive in Him, forgiven, redeemed, restored, growing, and
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.500]   making a difference.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:52.280]   So that you would have a limp like Jacob did, who wrestled with God because of the hard
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.800]   things and God touched him.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:37:00.160]   And he walked away touched by the work of God and able to reveal the beauty of His brokenness
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:05.440]   to those ahead and to point people towards the One who healed him.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:10.040]   And I pray that that is us, that that is what it means to be church.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.600]   That's growing big people.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.680]   And the question you've got to wrestle with here is, when you see Paul map out, I mean,
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.320]   is that not a beautiful process that he's mapped out?
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.080]   When you see Paul map out a process like that, here's the question we think.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.880]   We think that Paul's being mean about people who are infants in Jesus.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.280]   We could read that and think, Paul's got a problem with people who are just coming to
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.680]   Jesus or don't know much about Jesus.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:36.440]   And if that's you here in this room, maybe you're new to faith or maybe you're wrestling
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.640]   with faith, you're not sure, I want you to hear this.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.480]   That is not what Paul is saying.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.680]   He is not coming against those who are infants in the faith.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:49.360]   Equally, there are people who are mature in Christ Jesus who think because they've been
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.280]   Christians for 30, 40 years, that they don't have much more to learn about Christ.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.680]   He's coming for those people actually.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.640]   And he's saying both whether you're an infant in Christ or whether you think you're mature
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.160]   and you've got it all sorted out.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:06.060]   He's basically saying, if you just stay stagnant where you're at, that's not what Christ wants.
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:10.160]   He wants a maturing church, a maturing Christian.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.280]   And so if you're an infant, that's absolutely fine.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.080]   Your heart though should be, I want to learn, I want to grow, I want to deepen, I want to
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.080]   get mature.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:23.240]   And if you are a "mature Christian", you should be challenging yourself and saying, have I
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.280]   plateaued?
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.920]   Have I thought in arrogance that I know it all?
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.160]   Is there more for me to know of Christ?
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160]   Absolutely there is.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.600]   And so whether infant or mature, the heart Paul is saying is that you have a starting
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.640]   point right in this process right now.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.560]   Whether you've been a Christian two weeks or two minutes or 20, 30, 40 years, there's
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.280]   a starting point for you.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.480]   And that's the final part of the slide.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.920]   You can now take a photo of the slide if you want to.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.800]   There is the starting point that we all have.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:56.000]   And that starting point is what you're being invited into today.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.560]   If this is your home church, I hope what I've shared with you today out of Paul's vision,
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:07.480]   this is not actually the Vine's vision as in like we've come up with something special.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.440]   Our vision is that vision and that vision is Paul's vision for his church.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.600]   This is Paul mapping out what maturity in the church looks like.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:18.040]   But that is what we align ourselves and that's what we mean when we say we're here to grow
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.200]   big people.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.200]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.640]   That's everything we do strategically.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.760]   We want that process to be at work in our ministries and how we do things.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.200]   We want that process to be at work in your life and everything you experience.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.920]   We'd love that process to be at work outside the four walls of a 90-minute Sunday service.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.240]   That's our heart and our passion.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.480]   The question you've got to ask yourself is where are you starting on your ever going
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.960]   maturity journey today?
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.160]   And so for some of you in this room, your starting point might be like, you know what,
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.880]   I need to understand more about the truth.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.280]   You know what, I've shied away a little bit from God's absolute truth.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.600]   Maybe I've been a bit scared about it.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.600]   I need to actually embrace it.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.320]   I need to read my scriptures a bit more.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.800]   I need to talk to somebody about that.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.120]   I need to understand what are the foundations of gospel.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.520]   I need to understand what is doctrine.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.600]   I don't even know what doctrine is or theology.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.960]   I need someone to walk with me.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.360]   Maybe it's to sign up for a BSF class or do a manna class here at the Vine where we do
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.760]   Bible teaching with you.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.760]   It could be a whole variety of different things, but you're kind of saying, that's my starting
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   point.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.600]   Or maybe for some of you it's to get into a community group.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.720]   You've realized that you've been anonymous here too long and you've been wondering why
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.000]   it is that maybe you're not growing as much as you thought.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.640]   Let me tell you this, you will grow far more with eight to nine to ten people around your
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.920]   life who know your story and you know their story than you will from attending a lifetime's
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.240]   worth of 90 minutes on a Sunday.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.280]   That's where true discipleship takes place.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.880]   Not here, as much as we love what we're doing here.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.120]   I know I've said that a few times today, but we love this, but that's actually not the
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.480]   fullness of your discipleship.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.400]   Your discipleship will go to the next level when you commit your life to communing with
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.400]   people.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.760]   So, CGs, community groups, massive.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.160]   Maybe that's your starting point here today.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.440]   Maybe your starting point is to say, "Hey look, I want to be equipped more for works
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.440]   of service.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.440]   I realize I've become stagnant.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.600]   I realize that I basically just live my faith on a Sunday and I don't live my faith much
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   outwards.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.040]   I realize that God has gifted me, but I'm not really using those gifts."
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.640]   And you're thinking, "I want to actually think about what it means for me to serve the city
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:14.000]   of Hong Kong, to serve my bank, to serve that law firm, that educational institution, whatever
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.840]   it might be, serve my family.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.720]   I want to learn more about that.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.840]   That's my starting point."
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.760]   Or maybe for some of you it's this faith in the knowledge.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.200]   "I want to get that balance better in my life.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.680]   I've got a little bit too much of the experience I feel like I'm lacking."
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.760]   Or, "I feel like I've got too much of this, but I want to learn what are the gifts of
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.760]   the Spirit like.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.520]   I want to have somebody pray for me to receive some of the gifts.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.600]   I want to do more of that."
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.360]   And so, maybe it's like you want to get that balance of faith and knowledge better in your
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.360]   life.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.760]   I don't know what it is for you, but my challenge is if this is your church, this is what we're
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.880]   about.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.320]   And I said this at the Unite for Faith.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:51.120]   I want to say this again, and I'm saying it to you at the two as well.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.000]   And I'm not joking this.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   This is everything that the Vine is about.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.720]   So if this doesn't excite you, or if this is not what you want, I totally respect that.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.840]   And I would say, "Go check out some other churches."
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.600]   And I mean that because this is who we are.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.640]   And this is what we're going to pour our time and energy and leadership into.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.640]   This is what...
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.000]   And if you align with this, every Sunday when you come in, my heart and my prayer is that
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.400]   you'll feel like you're growing.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.720]   You'll feel like you're maturing.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.040]   You'll feel like you're being challenged.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.120]   You'll feel like the truth is being spoken in love.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.120]   You'll feel all of those things, and that will help you to grow.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.040]   And if you align with that, then the starting point is your question today.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.960]   How am I starting in that journey?
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.880]   And I pray that this excites you as much as it excites me.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.840]   And this is what's going to continue to be at the forefront of us as we hold forth and
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.360]   fast to the Word of God amongst us.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   Amen?
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.360]   Can I pray for us?
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:50.040]   Why don't you stand with me, and I'll pray for you.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.160]   I hope people come back next week, though.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:59.320]   I did kind of mean that, but hopefully you resonate with what we're talking about.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.000]   Things you regret later.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Okay.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   Father, we just are so grateful that we are here together.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.480]   And I wonder if this is resonating with you.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   This is your home church.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.800]   Can I just encourage you to just put your hands out as I pray, and I want to just commission
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.480]   you into the things that we're talking about.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.360]   And if you're visiting from another church or somewhere else, you can receive, of course,
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:25.360]   receive this as well for whatever context Christ has planted you into.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:32.200]   So as your hands are open, Father, we thank you that you called the vine to grow big people.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:37.800]   Thank you, Lord, that each person here represents a wonderful, created human being that you
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.520]   love so much, that the image of God is placed within, and that you're wanting to see flourish.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:51.360]   Father, I thank you that we have amazing doctors and nurses and teachers and educational professors.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.660]   We have entrepreneurs.
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:56.840]   We have people in politicians, people in the government, police.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:00.800]   Lord, we have all aspects of societies represented across our services.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.440]   Lord, that is such a beautiful thing.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.920]   Thank you.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.000]   Thank you, Lord, that you've blessed this community with variety and diversity.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.240]   Lord, I want to pray that there will be a unity felt amongst us as you build us up for
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.640]   works of service.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.320]   Lord, I want to pray for each person here who's saying the vine is their home church.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.480]   I want to pray that this starting point that you're putting on their spirit right now would
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:30.600]   be their next step in deepening their journey with us as a community of faith, but more
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.160]   than that, deepening their own journey in relationship with you, Lord.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.800]   I pray that we as a church will be able to serve that next step as best as we can, knowing
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.480]   that we won't always get it right and that we'll make mistakes along the way.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.640]   Lord, I pray that more than that, the people of this room would love each other, would
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:53.200]   love and encourage and cheer each other on deeply in the spirits of influence and the
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.120]   works of service that they are doing.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:01.040]   Lord, I want to pray that there would be such unity at the vine between experience of you,
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:05.440]   the heart and the faith and the works of the spirit and the power that there is in the
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:10.160]   spirit as well as the depth of your word and the roots of doctrine and good theology.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:15.760]   And Lord, I pray that those two things would come together in a beautiful way, Lord, that
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.480]   we would find ourselves deeper in knowledge and in faith of the Son of God.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:25.960]   And Lord, I pray for that whole measure, the whole measure of the whole measure of the
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:31.360]   whole measure of the fullness of Christ over each person.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:37.160]   And so Lord, today as we respond in worship, Lord, I want to just pray, maybe just you
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.680]   take the time as we worship now to think about what is my next step?
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.000]   What is my starting point?
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.200]   And maybe after the service you want to come forward and have someone pray for you.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.760]   Maybe for some of you that's the foster care situation we were talking about earlier.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.600]   You know, those next steps might be things that you're going to do, making room for God
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.880]   by serving the poor and the vulnerable, the marginalized of our city.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.480]   Maybe some of you want to do that as a next step.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:03.280]   It might be a lot of different things, but take the time to hear from the Holy Spirit.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.680]   And if you'd like prayer, we're going to have a team that will pray for you at the end of
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.860]   the service around that as well.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.920]   But as we respond, we do so asking Him to mature us and to grow us into big people.
