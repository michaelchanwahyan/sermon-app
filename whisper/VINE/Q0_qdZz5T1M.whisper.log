[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460]   Amen, amen, have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.440]   My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.300]   If you've just joined the Vine
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.440]   or only been a part of us for a little while,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.700]   we're so glad that you are here with us.
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.540]   We're in a series on the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.660]   We've been opening the scriptures
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.120]   around the Spirit each week.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.820]   And I wanna share out of a passage
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.520]   of the Apostle Paul writing to the church in Ephesus.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.340]   And Paul was a prolific man of prayer,
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.540]   loved to pray for people, loved to pray for his church.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.780]   He was deeply pastoral.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.380]   And in the book of Ephesians,
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.980]   he actually prays a number of times.
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.020]   And often when Paul prays,
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.900]   he's not just kind of like offering a prayer.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.260]   He's not just like Lord Jesus, amen kind of thing.
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.020]   He's actually trying to communicate
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.060]   and teach something to the church.
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.140]   His prayers are some of the deepest theological things
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.860]   that are found in his word.
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.620]   You can unpack them and get a sense
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.140]   of how he wants to pastor his church.
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.700]   And in the prayer I'm gonna read you here this morning,
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.740]   he says something about the Spirit.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.020]   And what he says about the Spirit
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.580]   is one of these paradoxes that we're gonna be unpacking
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.420]   throughout our series,
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.860]   these both and elements of the Spirit.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.020]   And this one is particularly key
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.900]   because this one draws us
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.500]   into a deeper knowledge of God himself.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500]   Let me read this to you from Ephesians 1,
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.720]   starting in verse 15.
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.860]   He says, "For this reason,
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.260]   ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.540]   and your love for all the saints,
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.620]   I have not stopped giving thanks for you,
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.700]   remembering you in my prayers."
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.340]   And here's what I pray.
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.620]   "I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.340]   the glorious Father, may give to you the Spirit,"
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.580]   or in other translations,
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.580]   "that the Spirit would give to you wisdom and revelation
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.100]   so that you may know him better."
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.980]   Father, our prayer this morning as we gather in this room
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.140]   in the overflow online is that that would happen in us,
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.700]   that as you open your scriptures to us,
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.820]   as you speak a fresh word to us,
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.580]   that we would come to know you deeper, better.
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.420]   And Lord, I believe that you have a personal thing
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.800]   that you wanna say to every person
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.680]   in this room here this morning.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.860]   And just as Emma has so beautifully prepared us,
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.940]   as we've brought that sacrifice of praise to you,
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.980]   as we've entered your gates with thanksgiving in our hearts,
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.020]   Lord, we pray now that you would reveal
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.580]   the innermost sort of passions and love
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.640]   that you have in your heart for each person in this room.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.620]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.460]   Everyone says.
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.500]   Amen.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.880]   So a number of years ago, my wife and I, Christine,
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.580]   we were in Bible school in Auckland, in New Zealand.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.180]   And my wife's from New Zealand,
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.420]   so when we decided to go to Bible school,
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.120]   we looked at lots of places we could have gone to,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.180]   we decided New Zealand was the place.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.020]   Auckland was the Bible school that we wanted to go to.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.380]   And it was a great place, we loved it.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.820]   But we always wanted to get out of Auckland
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.340]   and explore New Zealand.
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.820]   So on one particular long weekend,
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.980]   we decided we're gonna take a four-hour drive
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.080]   up to the north of New Zealand.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.260]   Now, the further you go north in New Zealand,
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.580]   the less people there are.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.300]   There's not a lot of people in New Zealand in general, okay?
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.860]   But the further north you go, the less people there are.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.620]   And a friend of ours had a house in a place called Russell,
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.540]   which is kind of northeast on the North Island.
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.540]   And so from where we were in Auckland to get there,
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.060]   it's about four hours.
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.460]   We had lectures all day, so we had to stay,
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.540]   but we decided to leave at around about six o'clock
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.380]   at night.
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.660]   About three hours in, around about nine o'clock,
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.820]   we knew that we would enter into this village.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.540]   And we had seen on the map that this village
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.060]   was the last largest populated area
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.340]   before we would end up where we were gonna go.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.740]   And so if we needed to eat,
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.800]   if we were gonna eat some food,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.180]   we needed to stop in this particular village.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.060]   On the map, it looked like a decent-sized village.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.820]   And I've come to learn that New Zealand
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.560]   kind of exaggerates the size of their towns on maps
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.360]   to make themselves feel a bit better.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.980]   And so we arrive at this town at like nine o'clock at night,
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.160]   and it literally was like way smaller
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.700]   than we were predicting.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.740]   It only had like one little road
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.720]   where there were some restaurants.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.620]   And we were there, like I say, about nine o'clock.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.900]   And so most of the restaurants there were shut.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.060]   In fact, there was only one restaurant
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.300]   that was open at that particular time
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.860]   on that particular night, only one restaurant.
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.660]   I wonder if you could imagine with me
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.860]   what type of restaurant it was
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.260]   that was open at nine o'clock at night
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.900]   in the middle of nowhere in New Zealand.
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.980]   Anyone get it?
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.980]   It was a Chinese takeaway restaurant.
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.600]   Yes, it was.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.060]   And not just a Chinese takeaway restaurant.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.060]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.460]   It was a Hong Kong-style Chinese takeaway.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.060]   I could tell right away,
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.140]   this looked like a dai pai dong from Mongkok or something.
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.540]   Like it just reeked Hong Kong.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.480]   And of course, we were homesick at the time.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.540]   And I was like, oh my gosh, this is so amazing.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.100]   There's a Hong Kong Chinese restaurant.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.060]   It's open.
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.060]   And it kind of, in the front of its door,
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.920]   it had like the beads that kind of go down
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.500]   to keep the flies out and stuff.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   And I said to Chris, I said, I'm gonna go in there
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.380]   and I'm gonna whip out my best Cantonese.
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.500]   You know, like I haven't spoken Cantonese for a while.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.540]   This is gonna be awesome.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.500]   And so sure enough, I was like,
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.900]   and I jumped into this restaurant.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.900]   I'm like, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.380]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.820]   So, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.500]   So, so I whip out my amazing,
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.700]   immaculate, perfectly pronounced Cantonese.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.500]   The man behind the counter, he's like 80 years old.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.260]   He's like the kind of guy when you go into a restaurant here
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.780]   has like a cigarette hanging out of their mouth, you know,
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.660]   like with the ash that's like, you know,
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.720]   gonna fall into the thing.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.380]   Like he's 80 years old, the oldest Chinese guy
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.220]   I think I've seen in a while.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.180]   He's like so wrinkled and stuff.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.020]   But as he hears my Cantonese, his face,
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.100]   he starts to smile, like the smile,
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.580]   literally years of youth enter his face.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.620]   It's like he suddenly becomes a new man.
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.540]   He's so excited that there's somebody in his restaurant,
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.380]   speaking Cantonese.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.220]   It's almost like him and his wife must've decided
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.900]   they're gonna plant a restaurant
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.100]   in the middle of this Chinese village
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.140]   or this village in New Zealand.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.940]   And they get there and there's like no Chinese
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.180]   for miles around, right?
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.500]   He's never heard Cantonese for years.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.980]   Here's this white guy speaking Cantonese in his restaurant.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.860]   He thinks this is the greatest thing
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.980]   that has ever happened to him.
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.420]   So he starts speaking Cantonese back at me.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.700]   And I tell you, he was like,
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.180]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.580]   Little does he know that I've exhausted
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.660]   every piece of Cantonese I have ever spoken.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.500]   But he doesn't know that.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.180]   He's just going, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.180]   I'm like, hi, hi, hi.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.300]   Pretending like I know what's going on, right?
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.780]   At one point he tells a joke.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.660]   I'm assuming 'cause he laughs, I'm like.
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.100]   (laughing)
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.580]   At one point I know he asked me a question
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.020]   because at the end of what he was saying,
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.340]   he like, ah, you know, it's like,
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.780]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.180]   And then he pauses and looks at me and I'm like.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.300]   And then he just keeps going, you know.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.020]   This guy, like years washed off him
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.500]   'cause somebody had entered in and spoken
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.700]   just a little bit, a little utterance
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.100]   of the native language that was in his heart.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:35.100]   Every human being is made in the image of God.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.100]   And every human being has the same singular heart language
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.380]   embedded in their soul.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.540]   And it's the heart language of the Spirit of God.
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.220]   And whether they know it or not,
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.060]   whether they believe in God or not,
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.340]   every single human being has a longing,
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.980]   a crying, a desperation deep within their soul
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.100]   to connect with the living God.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.180]   And the Spirit of God speaks.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.700]   And when the Spirit of God speaks into the person
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.780]   whose heart has long not heard the very language
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.540]   that brings them alive, they can't help but be changed.
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.460]   I mean, that guy in that restaurant that night
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.860]   hearing Cantonese changed him.
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.700]   He kind of came alive.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.220]   But I tell you what, when the Spirit of God speaks,
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.380]   when the Spirit of God speaks a word in season,
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.700]   when the Spirit of God says something
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.020]   or brings something in the scriptures alive to us,
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.100]   it literally comes and changes and transforms us.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.660]   The work of the Spirit of God,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.260]   the voice of the Spirit in our lives
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.980]   is designed to change us, to heal our hearts,
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.460]   to make us anew.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.160]   What I was teaching us in week one
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.820]   about going from disorder to order,
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.820]   that's the purpose of the reason why the Spirit speaks.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.620]   I mean, think about that for a moment.
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.620]   The very reason that the Spirit speaks
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.020]   is so that He can move His people
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.540]   from a place of disorder into a place of order.
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:16.300]   The Spirit communicates in order to change us.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.780]   He changes us by communicating to us.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.940]   That make sense?
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.080]   And when that voice comes,
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.300]   when we hear it deep within ourselves,
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.620]   everything shifts, everything begins to change.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.880]   And like I said in week one,
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.820]   it's because the Holy Spirit is a person.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.980]   And because the Holy Spirit is a person,
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.880]   He longs to be in relationship with us,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.260]   that connection that we can have with the Spirit.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.660]   We saw in week one that there was this idea
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.980]   of the fellowship of the Spirit.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.120]   So our connection point to the Spirit
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.300]   is found in this kind of reciprocal relationship
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.060]   we can have in communication,
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.860]   Him communicating to us so that we are changed
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.260]   and us communicating with Him
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.220]   and deepening our relationship with God.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.600]   And the reason why this is all taking place
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.500]   is because God longs to bring into all of us
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.020]   clarity and focus.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.300]   He loves to bring into all of us wholeness.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.680]   It's that order that the Spirit of God
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.820]   is moving us towards.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.020]   He wants you to be whole, to be clear about life,
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.660]   to move out of confusion.
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.180]   When the Spirit speaks, it's never to bring confusion.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.340]   It's always to turn confusion on its head.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.660]   The Spirit always wants to bring clarity
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.940]   and refreshment and newness and wholeness to you.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.700]   That doesn't mean though,
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.060]   that every time the Spirit speaks,
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.440]   it's gonna be something you're gonna wanna hear.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.820]   So often when the Spirit speaks,
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.260]   the Spirit actually does the contrary.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.300]   He actually says something that we don't want to hear,
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.620]   but we need to hear.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.060]   Doesn't mean always that the Spirit
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.700]   has such nice things to say.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.120]   Sometimes the word comes from the Spirit
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.180]   that actually shapes and changes
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.060]   'cause He needs to disrupt the disorder
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.900]   in order to bring the order.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.740]   But no matter how it happens,
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.580]   the Spirit's word changes all.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.340]   If I was to summarize it, I would put it like this.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.420]   The Spirit's goal is to communicate to you
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.780]   so that you would receive clarity, wisdom, and understanding
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.380]   so that you would be strengthened, comforted, and changed.
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.060]   That's a good slide to take a photo of
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.660]   if you wanna take a slide photo.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.020]   This idea that He wants to bring clarity and wisdom
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.940]   and understanding into us so that we would be strengthened,
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.020]   comforted, and changed is the work of the Spirit.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.100]   It's that native language that sits within all of us.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.900]   And when we hear the Spirit,
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.620]   something within us begins to shift.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.940]   Something within us begins to change.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.260]   And why do we change?
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.220]   Because the Spirit leads us to the person of Jesus.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.540]   Remember, it's Jesus that changes everything.
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.920]   And the Spirit's role is to illuminate Jesus,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.860]   to help us to see Jesus clearer and better
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.740]   so that in Jesus, we can be transformed and renewed.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.580]   In the same way that Jesus's role is to reveal the Father,
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.220]   the Spirit's role is to reveal Jesus.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.260]   You following?
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.480]   So it's the Spirit speaks to us in that native language
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.860]   that all of our souls are crying out for
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.880]   so that we would see Jesus more clearly
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.820]   so that we would ultimately come to know the Father.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.200]   The Spirit into Jesus, Jesus into the Father,
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   the triune Godhead at work because God's voice is at work.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.560]   This is why when Paul picks up this prayer for the church,
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.000]   he wants to help them to understand
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.840]   how the Spirit connects us to Jesus
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.000]   so that we can know the Father.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And he mentions this next kind of and/or paradox
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.600]   that we're looking at,
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.520]   or the both/and paradox that we're looking at in this series.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.960]   And it's the idea of teaching and revelation.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.460]   Let me read this to you from Ephesians 1, verse 17 again.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.180]   I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.260]   the glorious Father,
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.340]   may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation,
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.380]   or in other translations,
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.980]   the spirit that brings wisdom and revelation
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.360]   so that you may know Him better.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.620]   Now, that's not the Spirit of God.
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.780]   Now, before I break this down
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.940]   into its individual parts,
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.760]   let me step you back for a moment,
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.400]   and you need to see the whole.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.200]   It's so beautiful what Paul is saying here.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.520]   He's praying to the church.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.300]   His desire for them is to know God more.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.940]   He wants them to know God better,
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.680]   and he understands that the only way
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.240]   that they're gonna know God better
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.080]   is through the work of the Spirit
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.280]   in teaching and revelation.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.060]   That teaching and revelation provides for us,
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.440]   as Paul writes it here, wisdom and revelation,
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.440]   it provides for us the pathway
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.420]   to be able to get to know Jesus better.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.920]   An analogy might be to think of this
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.240]   a little bit like Zacchaeus in Luke chapter 19.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.480]   You'll be perhaps familiar with the story of Zacchaeus.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.920]   Zacchaeus, we're told in the Scriptures, was a short person,
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.920]   and because he was short,
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.460]   he didn't have the stature to see over the crowd
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.680]   in order to capture a good glimpse of Jesus.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.440]   And on this one particular day, Jesus is walking by,
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.900]   but Zacchaeus, being small,
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.680]   can't see Him properly through the crowd.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.280]   And so Zacchaeus does a smart thing.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.280]   He runs ahead, finds a tree, he climbs up this tree
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.800]   so he can get a clear view of Jesus.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.240]   And then Jesus and him lock eyes together,
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.720]   and Zacchaeus invites Jesus to his house,
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.980]   and Jesus transforms not just Zacchaeus' life,
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.400]   but his whole family life.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.520]   It's a beautiful part of Scripture.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.840]   I think that's analogous
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.640]   to what Paul is trying to communicate here.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.360]   Every single one of us, if you will,
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.300]   we're short in stature
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.480]   when it comes to being able to see Jesus.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.440]   Our sin, our brokenness, and our flesh
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.320]   does not work to help us to see Jesus more clearly.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.880]   Our sin is a little bit like a crowd in front of us,
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.320]   a crowd that's taller than we are,
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.120]   so that we're not able to be able to connect and see Jesus.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.340]   But God has provided for us a way
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.800]   that we can move up above that sin,
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.040]   above that brokenness, to deal with it, if you will.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.760]   It's a tree of His teaching
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.960]   and revelation by the Spirit.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.720]   And as we go up that tree,
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.820]   we actually get a clearer view of who Jesus is.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.720]   That's what Paul says here.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.840]   I hope that the Spirit comes
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.920]   to bring you wisdom and revelation
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.760]   so you will see Him better, know Him better,
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.580]   engage with Him better,
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.240]   so that you can lift yourself out of the crowd
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.840]   towards the vision of Jesus, who changes everything.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.840]   So I wonder whether here this morning
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.240]   we might have some time to climb that tree together.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.680]   I wanna unpack for you what this wisdom and revelation,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.380]   teaching and revelation,
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.320]   this two sides of this both-and paradox of the Spirit
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.920]   is all about for you.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.600]   Paul begins with this idea of wisdom.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.160]   He uses the word wisdom here.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.740]   He's actually talking about this process
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.400]   of the Spirit teaching.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.220]   I'll connect the two of them together in a moment.
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.320]   But he starts out by saying,
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.480]   look, He's gonna bring a spirit of wisdom
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.080]   so you can know Him better.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.120]   The Greek word that Paul chooses here for wisdom,
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.760]   somewhat unique in this part of the Scriptures,
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.920]   and it's a word that has a lot of different things
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.680]   that come together to help you understand it.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.000]   But essentially it means to illuminate,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.080]   to make clear, to bring understanding, to give clarity.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.760]   So the idea of wisdom is to take something,
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.720]   now this is really important, listen to this,
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.960]   take something that is already known
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.280]   and help us to understand it, illuminate,
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.440]   shine a light on something that is already present,
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.360]   already known, and help us to understand it
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.840]   so we can then embrace it for our lives.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.040]   This is the concept that Paul's trying to communicate
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.240]   about how the Spirit works in us.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.720]   It brings us understanding, illumination,
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.560]   teaching of what has already been given to us.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.400]   Now this is really important that you notice
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.020]   that what it's emphasizing
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.360]   is something that's already been given.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.880]   The teaching side is like, hey, I've given you something,
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.700]   whether that's my presence in the world
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.320]   or particularly of course the Scriptures themselves,
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.720]   the Word of God contained for us in the Bible.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.560]   And he's like, my Spirit will help you and teach you
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.760]   so that he will illuminate
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.960]   so that you will come to a better understanding,
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.880]   so that you will come to see Jesus more clearly.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.680]   The reality is these are just words on a page
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.680]   without the work of the Spirit in our lives.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.560]   And words on a page have never changed or transformed anyone.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.080]   They might have given somebody some knowledge of something,
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.920]   some understanding of it, but it's not transformative.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.580]   And what Paul's saying is my prayer is
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.480]   that the Spirit will come to teach you,
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.520]   to illuminate, to reveal, to strengthen,
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.080]   to help you to see more clearly
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.480]   the very thing that he's already given you.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.400]   That make sense?
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.240]   Now Jesus himself actually taught this.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.360]   Let me show you Jesus speaking to the disciples
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.080]   in chapter 14 of John.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.160]   He puts it this way.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.280]   He says, "But the counselor or the advocate,
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.480]   the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.040]   will," notice this, "teach you all things
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.380]   and remind you of everything I've said to you."
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.340]   So this is Jesus kind of taking the same concept
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.560]   that Paul's speaking about.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.560]   And Jesus is saying, look,
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.600]   here's what you need to understand.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.620]   The Spirit is gonna come
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.800]   and the Spirit will teach you all things,
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.840]   illuminate all things,
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.440]   and remind you of the things that I've already said to you.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.920]   In other words, there's already stuff out there.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.320]   There's my word that I've already communicated,
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.520]   whether that's to you directly, audibly,
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.120]   or whether it's written down in the Scriptures.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.760]   For them, it was of course the Old Testament.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.840]   He said, "In all of that, the Spirit will illuminate it
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.680]   so you will know me better."
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.480]   So he will remind you of all of the things
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.680]   that I have said to you.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.960]   This is how you begin to climb the tree.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.740]   Anyone here ever opened the Bible and fallen asleep?
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.000]   Come on, church, let me see the hands, be honest.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.800]   That's pretty much every single one of us, I know.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.880]   I've been a Christian for 30 years, I understand, okay?
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.060]   Even as a pastor, I open the Word sometimes
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.960]   and I'm tempted to fall asleep.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.400]   Here's a trick.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.320]   If you ever wanna stay awake reading the Scriptures,
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.360]   here's a trick.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.260]   When you open the Scriptures, before you read it,
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.040]   just pray a simple prayer.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.820]   Holy Spirit, would you teach me?
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.560]   I invite you to teach me your Word
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.800]   so I could become more like Christ Jesus.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:46.340]   If you pray that every single time you open God's Word,
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.900]   you are aligning yourself to the Spirit of God.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.180]   You are aligning yourself to the very thing
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.940]   that the Spirit was designed to do
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.120]   and that is to illuminate what has already been given,
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.860]   to teach you, equip you in what has already been given.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:01.940]   That make sense?
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.580]   So that's an important prayer to pray
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.100]   when you're coming to read Scripture.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.460]   Now, this all then brings us back
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.420]   to why Paul writes wisdom here
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.040]   rather than the word teaching,
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.100]   because the whole point is to make us
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.020]   more and more like Christ Jesus.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.020]   Notice what he says.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.860]   He says, "So that you would gain wisdom
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.220]   "so that you may know Him better."
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.620]   Wisdom is this Hebrew concept
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.780]   that is beyond just knowing something.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.540]   When the Hebrews spoke about wisdom,
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.380]   what it was was it was a lifestyle,
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.620]   not just a mental information thing.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.860]   In other words, for Paul, his prayer is
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.340]   when the Spirit teaches us,
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.020]   it doesn't just give us right information,
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.540]   it also leads us towards right application.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.700]   And this is really important for Paul
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.480]   because he wants you to understand
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.180]   that you are a fool, the opposite of wisdom,
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.140]   if you allow the Spirit to give you understanding
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.500]   and you do nothing with it.
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.900]   That if you get illuminated in the Scriptures,
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.460]   you learn something about God
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.860]   and you learn something about His characters and His ways,
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.100]   and you walk away and don't change.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.060]   He's like, "You're a fool if that's what you think."
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.780]   Now, the Spirit is here to bring wisdom,
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.900]   and wisdom, the wise, are ones who not only
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.720]   are illuminated by the Spirit,
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.220]   but then decide to put that into practice in their lives,
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.720]   decide to live differently, act differently,
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.580]   think differently, under the power and the leading
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.000]   and the guiding of the Spirit.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.420]   Those are the ones that have actually been taught
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.380]   by the Spirit, Paul is saying.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.860]   And my prayer is that you would receive the Spirit
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.240]   that teaches you to wisdom,
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:43.840]   not teaches you to foolishness, teaches you to wisdom.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.100]   So, the first part of this paradox
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.100]   is that the Spirit teaches us the things
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.540]   that are already there and helps us to be illuminated,
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.160]   to understand, so we can apply that into our lives.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.300]   But then there's the second side of this paradox,
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.120]   the word he uses here is revelation.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.720]   Think of it this way, the Spirit does not just illuminate
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.740]   the word that's already received.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.720]   The Spirit also reveals the word that is yet to come.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.680]   This idea of revelation, the other side
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.900]   of the Spirit's work here, is literally the Greek word
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.620]   for revelation that Paul uses here,
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.300]   is literally translated like this,
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:27.380]   to kind of disclose or to reveal something
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.680]   that was previously unknown.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.300]   So, notice this, guys, where teaching
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.040]   was about taking what was known
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.340]   and helping it to be understood and applied.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.840]   That make sense, follow that?
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.940]   Revelation is taking the things
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.880]   that are not previously known and bringing them to us.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.420]   So, there are both of these moments at work.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.700]   And it's really important that you understand
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.460]   that these never contradict themselves.
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.180]   They're all from the same source, and that's the Father.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.020]   And when the Father works in this world,
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.660]   he works by illuminating the things he's already given,
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.060]   and he brings a fresh revelation, a fresh perspective,
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.980]   a fresh idea of perhaps things
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.860]   that we had never even thought about before.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.500]   And both of those things work together,
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.820]   never contradict each other.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.660]   In fact, that's how we test whether revelation
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.540]   is really from the God or not.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.180]   'Cause let's face it, sometimes we can hear
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.020]   some pretty weird things.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.020]   Sometimes we can eat a really spicy curry
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.460]   and have a crazy thought afterwards
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.700]   and think that that might be Jesus.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.420]   The way that we take revelation
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:30.060]   and know that it is from him is we link it to Scripture.
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.700]   It will never contradict it, it will always work together.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.180]   But you need to know that it's not just about
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.320]   discovering the word that's here,
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.540]   there's also the spoken word of God in the here and now.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.740]   And those things are beautiful
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.460]   because they're both the work of the Spirit,
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.700]   and they both help us, the tree, to climb
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.080]   to be able to see Jesus more clearly.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.580]   I mean, just step back from this for a moment
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.340]   and reflect on this.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.420]   We don't have a God who decided to speak
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.800]   to a bunch of people 2,000 years ago and then went silent.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.700]   We do have a God who spoke to a bunch of people
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.340]   2,000 years ago, captured in the word of God,
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.660]   which is a rich depository of grace and goodness
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.680]   and life eternal.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.660]   But we also have a God who's still speaking today,
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.500]   a God whose voice is still at work
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.860]   so that those souls who are crying out for connection
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.260]   come alive, so that like that man in the restaurant
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.460]   whose literally ears has dropped off his face
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.540]   when he heard that language,
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.980]   so people can still be caught up in the wonder
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.180]   of a God who speaks in this moment.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.400]   And when God speaks, he opens up for us
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.540]   this idea of things that might be going on in our lives,
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.660]   maybe things that nobody else knows, only God knows.
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.700]   And God brings a word or a picture
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.780]   or even illuminates a Scripture
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.780]   that helps to transform something within us.
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.460]   And we're like, so many times when people
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.580]   like listen to people speak here at the Vine,
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.420]   oftentimes when I'm talking to them afterwards,
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.100]   they're like, well, it was just like that person
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.100]   was speaking directly to me.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.540]   And I'm like, yes, that's the Holy Spirit at work for you,
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.780]   bringing a revelation of something he wants you
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.500]   to be aware of that you previously were not aware of.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.180]   It's a wonder when he does that.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.940]   Paul, writing just to the church in Corinth,
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.740]   unpacks this concept a little bit more.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.700]   So I wanna dig into this just a little bit more for you.
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.220]   So this is 1 Corinthians 2, starting in verse 6.
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.060]   He writes to the church, he says,
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.940]   "We do, however, speak a message of wisdom
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.780]   amongst the mature."
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.240]   There again, he talks about wisdom,
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.980]   the teaching and the application of God's word,
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.380]   "But not the wisdom of this age or the rulers of this age
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.520]   who are coming to nothing."
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.300]   So Paul wants you to know that there is not just
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.500]   God's wisdom, there's also the wisdom of this age.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.100]   And I tell you what, you will always battle as a Christian
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.140]   between which of those two things you apply to your life.
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.560]   And if you're anything like me, you apply that one,
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.900]   sometimes almost as much as you apply this one.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.300]   This one being the word of God, by the way,
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.380]   the wisdom of God.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.220]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.320]   I think we wrestle with this, don't we?
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.220]   The wisdom of the world, which seems so tempting
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.420]   and seems so seductive to us, and God's wisdom.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.260]   Paul says, "There is wisdom out there,
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.220]   the wisdom of the world,
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.180]   but we have a different wisdom," he says,
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.660]   "one that's been spoken amongst the mature."
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.380]   Verse 7, "No, we speak of God's mystery,
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.460]   God's wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden,
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.140]   so therefore it wasn't known before,
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.980]   that God has destined for our glory before time began.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.220]   None of the rulers of this age understood it,
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.460]   for if they had, they would have not have crucified
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.560]   the Lord of glory.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.900]   However, here's what's been written in the scriptures.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.020]   "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.340]   what God has prepared for those who love Him."
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.900]   You need to know in this room today that if you love Jesus,
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.460]   God has a lot prepared for you.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:50.540]   He's prepared things for you, 'cause He loves you.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.900]   Things that He's set aside,
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.960]   things that He's prepared in His written word
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.460]   that are to be illuminated and brought alive in your life,
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.780]   and things that He's prepared that He wants to say to you
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.680]   directly and personally by His Spirit.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   How does this happen?
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   Notice verse 10, "But God has revealed it to us," by what?
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.500]   By His Spirit.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.420]   "The Spirit searches all things,
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.260]   even the deep things of God.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.940]   For who among people know the thoughts of a person
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.060]   except that person's spirit within them?
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.980]   In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God,"
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.060]   here it is, "except the Spirit of God.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.560]   We have not received the Spirit of this world,
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.500]   but the Spirit who is from God,
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.960]   that we may understand what God has freely given to us.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.260]   That is what we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom,
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.620]   but in words taught by the Spirit."
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.180]   Notice this, "Explaining spiritual realities
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.940]   by Spirit-taught words."
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.540]   That's revelation, my friends.
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.940]   I don't know about you, but that's what I want in my life.
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.540]   I wanna look out on this world
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.060]   and not see physical reality, but spiritual reality.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.700]   I wanna see spiritual reality in my life.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.740]   I want the Holy Spirit to explain
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.900]   spiritual realities within me
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.860]   and spiritual realities in my city of Hong Kong
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.940]   with Spirit-taught words,
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.820]   not from the wisdom of this world,
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.540]   but the wisdom that can only come
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.420]   from the one who is still speaking today.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.420]   When we hear Spirit-taught words,
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.780]   it brings us into spiritual reality.
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.580]   So Paul is saying, look,
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.140]   you need to sit with this tension of the both and and.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.220]   It's not just the word, it's all about the word.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.540]   And it's not just revelation.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.500]   It's both of these things working together.
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.620]   The word that is illuminated by the Spirit
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.380]   to great understanding and application
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.900]   and the revelation of the spiritual realities
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.620]   of this world and of our lives
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.380]   by Spirit-taught words that can only come from God
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.380]   because only the Spirit searches
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.260]   the innermost realms of God.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.220]   This was happening in the gatherings
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.380]   that Paul's early church was in in those days.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.420]   This was happening all over the place.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.900]   In fact, actually in Corinth, it was happening so much
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.260]   that there was kind of disorder happening in the church.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.100]   And remember, the Spirit is here to take disorder to order.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.420]   So Paul writes to the church about this disorder
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.740]   that's happening in their gatherings
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.980]   because there's so many kind of things happening,
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.620]   particularly the abuse of tongues,
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.020]   which maybe we'll get to in another week here.
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.980]   But in this moment, he writes to them to understand,
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.660]   look, there needs to be order,
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.140]   and there can be order if you quieten down
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.700]   and open your ears to hear what the Spirit says.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.700]   Let me show you this in 1 Corinthians 14, verses one to three.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.460]   He says, "Follow the way of love
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.260]   "and eagerly desire spiritual gifts."
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.180]   Pastor Ellison's gonna preach on spiritual gifts
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.700]   in a few weeks' time, "especially the gift of prophecy.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.300]   "For anyone who speaks in a tongue
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.540]   "does not speak to people but to God.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.660]   "Indeed, no one understands that person.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.060]   "They utter mysteries within their spirit.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.820]   "But everyone who prophesies speaks to people
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.260]   "for their strengthening, encouragement, and comfort."
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.380]   I love this, Paul's saying,
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.260]   "This is why I want you to eagerly desire prophecy
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.280]   "in your midst, because when the Spirit speaks,
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.660]   "revelation comes, it is for the strengthening,
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.100]   "it is for the encouragement,
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.020]   "and it is for the comfort of the church."
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.180]   And he's like, why would you not want that?
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.860]   Like he's like, embrace prophecy amongst you.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.780]   Embrace the work of the Spirit amongst you.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.740]   'Cause yes, he's gonna illuminate and teach you
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.500]   and apply the Word so good,
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.740]   but he's also gonna bring that life-changing moment Word
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.020]   that speaks in your life.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.180]   And you're like, how did the Spirit know
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.820]   about that work thing that's going on?
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.580]   Because I haven't told anyone about it.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.940]   And suddenly this Word comes,
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.380]   spiritual realities by Spirit-taught words
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.260]   that changes everything for us.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.940]   And like that restaurant and that guy,
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.780]   everything drops off us and we become the people
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.660]   that we were created to be.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.740]   Understanding, revelation, teaching, God's Word,
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.900]   coming together and making us into the people
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.340]   that we were designed to be, disorder into order.
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:14.180]   Over our time together, hopefully today,
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.660]   I've done the best that I can in the teaching part,
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.420]   helping to illuminate the scriptures
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.780]   so that we can both know and apply God better.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:28.360]   But we wanna now take some time on the revelation part.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.280]   And during our service at our pre-service part time
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.400]   and during our worship time,
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.680]   our pastors and our prayer ministers here at the Vine,
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.880]   they've been praying and asking
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.720]   for specifically Spirit-taught words,
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.320]   revelation, prophetic words that are spoken to us
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.040]   so that we can speak them to you
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.600]   so that we can begin to listen
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.640]   to the Word of God that way together.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.560]   I'm so excited about this.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.760]   Would you stand with me?
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:56.520]   And as you stand, I want you to do two things.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.560]   Number one, everybody look at me.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.200]   Is everybody looking at me?
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.800]   Good looking, right?
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.960]   Okay, you're looking at me because here's the thing.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.100]   Do not leave.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:12.840]   Hear from your pastor.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.680]   Do not leave.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.640]   The Lord has something He wants to say to you, amen?
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.480]   That's the first thing.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.480]   Second thing, I wanna encourage you just to open your hands.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.600]   Because as we open our hands,
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.800]   we're in a posture of receiving before the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.280]   And I wanna pray for us,
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.460]   and then we're gonna listen to some Spirit-taught words.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:39.600]   Holy Spirit, we thank you for the teaching and revelation
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.520]   that you have poured out on your church
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.820]   so that we could climb that tree and see you clearly.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:51.320]   And Lord, in this moment, we ask you to speak.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.960]   Holy Spirit, would you speak?
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.520]   Lord, I believe that you have a word
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.480]   for a lot of people in this room.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:06.060]   A word that doesn't come from human wisdom, human strength,
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.240]   but a word that comes from your Spirit.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.020]   So Lord, we pray that you would speak.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.520]   And that in these words that are about to be spoken,
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.540]   many people here would come alive.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:24.680]   So just keep yourself in a posture of receiving
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.480]   and I'm gonna make space now for any of the pastors,
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.000]   prayer ministers who have a word,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.400]   for people in this room to come forward and share that word.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.980]   (gentle music)
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.640]   (bells ringing)
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.300]   (bells ringing)
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:54.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
