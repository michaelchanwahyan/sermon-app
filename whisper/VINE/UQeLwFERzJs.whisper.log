[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   There's this really poignant moment in the resurrection story that the Gospel of John
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.520]   brings to us.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.480]   He pitches this moment where him and Peter run to the tomb.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.680]   They've heard the news that the tomb was empty.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.880]   And at this point, they're grappling with this juxtaposition that they hold in their
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.000]   hearts because they had thought that maybe Jesus was the Messiah, but he'd been killed
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.440]   on that cross on Friday.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.360]   And Saturday had been the loneliest of days.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.280]   They were actually hiding as disciples in fear on Saturday.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.720]   Now on Sunday morning, the women had come to the tomb early and they had noticed the
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.400]   stone was removed and that Jesus was no longer there.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.800]   And they had brought story of that to the disciples.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.760]   And Peter and John, they run to the tomb for themselves to see if this is really true.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.680]   And there's a moment where they arrive at the tomb and John tells us, he's an eyewitness
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.840]   to the account, he says, he got there first.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.960]   He outran Peter, he got there first, but he stops outside the tomb.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.880]   And Peter comes and doesn't stop.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.200]   Peter just runs straight into the tomb.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.200]   That's kind of like Peter.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.940]   Peter was always like just gung ho, right?
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.240]   But John stays outside the tomb and he doesn't explain it, but I think there's this moment
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.720]   for John where he's thinking to himself, if I walk in there and it's empty, I'm going
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.680]   to have to believe that he's the Messiah.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.860]   Like I can't walk in there and think anything else.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.340]   Like if what the women have been saying is true, then he's like, this changes everything.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.780]   And all the doubts I had and all the things that I'd struggled with and all the confusion
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.160]   that was there over the last 48 hours, if I walk in here and it's empty, then I've got
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.000]   to believe something different.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.920]   And my sense is for each one of us here in this room, whether you've been a Christian
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.900]   for 40 years or 50 years or whether maybe you come in today and you wouldn't even say
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.260]   you're a Christian, no matter where on the spectrum we might be, what Easter does is
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.440]   it creates a question for all of us.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.100]   Do you or will you believe?
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.320]   Like the tomb is empty and it's almost like we're all standing on the outside and we have
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.500]   a decision to make.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.300]   Are we going to enter in as John does?
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.800]   And it says, I entered in and then I believed.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.160]   And I'm so excited that you're here today.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.920]   I'm so excited that you're in this room.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.160]   And for some of you, maybe this is the first time you've been here.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.540]   We're so glad you're here.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.560]   Maybe for some of you, you come here every Sunday, but every single one of us, it's like
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.360]   we're standing right now in this moment before an empty tomb.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.520]   And Jesus is saying, will you enter and believe?
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.680]   It's an invitation that's open to all of us.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.720]   That's the beauty of Easter.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.220]   And as we open up the Easter story for you today, my prayer is that God's presence would
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.040]   be with you and that his spirit would be challenging your heart.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.160]   And that you would feel that there is a God of love and grace and goodness who's never
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.680]   going to force you to do anything, but who has rolled the stone away and presented to
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.680]   you an empty tomb.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.680]   And he's saying, will you enter and believe?
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.680]   Father, as we open your scriptures today, Lord, we want to pray that all of us in joy
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.240]   would enter into the deepest and most fulfilling relationship with the creator of all things.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.680]   And Father, we thank you for this precious moment where we gather on this day.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.680]   We pray all of this in Jesus' name.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.480]   Everyone says, hey, can we put our hands together and thank our worship team?
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.480]   Wonderful, wonderful.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.120]   Why don't you have a seat?
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.200]   When you're sitting down, why don't you say hi to someone around you?
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.920]   Say like, hi, who are you?
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   Nice to meet you.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.440]   I don't know, I don't think I've ever met you before.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.280]   What is your name?
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.160]   All right.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.720]   Now we have a lot, a lot of people that don't have seats.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.320]   So if you have a spare seat beside you, that's an Easter miracle in and of itself.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.880]   But if you have a spare seat beside you, can you just put your hand up so that we can get
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.360]   everybody here in?
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.160]   Okay, there's a couple of spare seats over here.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.600]   Come on in, guys, if you're sitting down there.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.080]   Guys, you guys, up, up, up, up.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.080]   Come, come, come.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.960]   We don't want you to sit there because that's in the way, actually.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   Come over here.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   You can sit over here.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   Hi.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.560]   Plenty, plenty of places to sit.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.400]   Hands up if you've got spare seats, please, everyone.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   Thank you so much.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   Awesome.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.800]   One spare seat right here in the middle.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.400]   Who's going to be the brave person?
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.920]   Trudy, you're going to be the brave person to take the seat right here in the middle.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.920]   Come on.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.920]   I want to see you shunt along the row.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.600]   Let's give Trudy a round of applause.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.160]   Well done.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   I can embarrass her.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.160]   She's an ex-elder.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.160]   It's fine.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160]   It's fine.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.160]   I'm surrounded by people.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   This is amazing.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160]   How's everyone doing?
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.800]   If you're new to the Vine, welcome.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   My name's Andrew.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.880]   We're so, so glad that you are with us today.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:05.580]   When I was 14 years old, I very, very nearly drowned to death.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.720]   It's actually a moment in my life that still causes me great trauma when I think of water,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.720]   even to this day.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.520]   I nearly, nearly drowned to death.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.280]   I was at Waterworld at Ocean Park at the time.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.120]   Now this is not, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the new Waterworld that you're all
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.720]   familiar with today.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.080]   The Waterworld where they finally realized that there is such a thing as occupational
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.440]   health and safety.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.040]   This was back in the '80s and '90s, right?
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.400]   The '80s and '90s where as a 14-year-old kid, we would go to Waterworld and that place was
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   rugged.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   I mean, that was down to earth.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.480]   This was the OG of water parks.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.920]   And there was a lot of things that you could get up to in that place where it was pretty
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.920]   dangerous.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.440]   But the ride that was the most favorite for everybody was the Raging River.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.680]   Now hands up if you ever did the Raging River in the old OG water park.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.840]   Come on.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   You survived.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.400]   I almost didn't survive.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.520]   Let me tell you the story.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.960]   So the Raging River was this crazy water slide where everybody was given a big, large, inflatable
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.960]   ring.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.080]   And you sat in the ring, like you sort of jumped up inside the ring and you sat in the
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.080]   ring.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   Your bum was kind of in the hole, right?
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.680]   And you sat there nice and comfortable holding onto it.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.680]   And the Raging River was basically a network of small little pools and slides, big, large
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.140]   slides that went down the side of this mountain.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.800]   Now what you would do is you'd sit in your little kind of inflatable ring and you would
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.960]   slide down a slide and then you would end up in the next pool.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.880]   A few of you would gather in the pool and then you would slide on down to the next one
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.440]   and so on and so forth until you got to the bottom.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.500]   Now this slide had an inherent danger to it.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.480]   The inherent danger was what would happen when too many people would gather in one of
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.160]   the pools before going down to the next one.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.340]   And there were people up in the pool above wanting to come down into their pool.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.520]   And the danger would be what would happen if somebody slid down and sort of crashed
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.200]   into everybody that was in the pool below.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.200]   Does that make sense?
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.600]   And then that was going to create a problem.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.520]   So Waterworld realized they had an inherent danger in their mechanism of the slide.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.040]   So they hired a bunch of young men.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.840]   These guys look like triads.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.320]   There's no other way of saying it.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.920]   A bunch of triads basically were hired.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.360]   And they wore dark sunglasses and they had walkie-talkies.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.960]   And their job was basically to tell you when you could go down the slides and when you
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.960]   couldn't.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.000]   So their job was to kind of go, "Okay, there's too many people in the pool right now.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Everybody up there, stop."
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.120]   And then they would let some people down and make some space and that so forth.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.800]   Now, on this one particular day, me and my mates were in the raging river.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.480]   Now one of the things that we loved to do was to be dangerous.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.360]   And how we were dangerous was we would dare each other.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.400]   Like whichever pool seems to be the busiest, I dare you to slide on down, even if the triads
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.560]   tell you not to.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.760]   And this was the whole thing.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.200]   We would dare each other all the time.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.600]   Well, on this one particular day, we're up in one of the pools and we're looking down
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.600]   at the pool below.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.280]   Now, we had never seen the pool so full.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:11.280]   Maybe 15 kind of inflatable rings would have already have filled the pool, but there was
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.240]   probably like 20 or so inflatable rings, people in there already in this pool.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:23.160]   And it was so full that none of my friends had the courage to give it a go except me.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.800]   And I looked down on that pool and I was like, "This is my time to shine.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.600]   This is my moment of glory.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.660]   This is my moment to show my friends that I'm the bravest and the strongest and the
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.620]   craziest of them all."
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.820]   And so although the sun shades, walkie-talkie guys were saying to us, "Don't go," I kind
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.480]   of looked left, I looked right.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.520]   And I grabbed my ring and I jumped down onto the slide.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.600]   I actually went down like this, head first, like this.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:55.960]   Have you ever had a moment in your life where you start something and like the momentum
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.520]   kicks in and you realize you can't back out anymore, but you immediately realize that
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.520]   you made a mistake?
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.080]   Have you ever had a moment like that in your life?
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.160]   This was that moment for me.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:11.260]   As soon as I started on that slide, I realized I have made a big, big mistake.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.680]   The guys that were down below in the pool, there was this one man and he was the one
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.240]   who was closest to the slide, right?
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.560]   And so he's sitting there and he looks up and there's this crazy guilo kid like barreling
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.360]   down at him head first.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.640]   Now, he does something that I did not expect that he would do.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.400]   Normally what would happen when we did this is we would slide down into the full pool
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.000]   below and they would like not know what to do.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.420]   So we would hit them and fly up over the top of them and it was kind of funny for us, not
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.480]   for them.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.380]   This guy, I don't know whether that's happened to him before or not, but he sits there, he
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.100]   realizes there's this crazy kid coming down the slide.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.100]   So he does this.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.220]   He leans a little bit and he lifts up his donut like this, lifts up his ring like this.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:03.660]   What that means is he suddenly creates a little pool of water where Andrew flies in head first.
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.840]   And rather than bouncing up on top of them, which is what I was planning to do, I suddenly
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.740]   found myself in the pool under them.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:21.440]   I looked up and I had a ceiling of bums above me, bums from everywhere.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.160]   And they were packed in there so much that I realized immediately there was no way for
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.160]   me to escape.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.940]   I mean, there was no way for me to get up and out to get breath.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.520]   And immediately I was in a place of panic.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.480]   I literally thought this is how I'm going to die.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.860]   And as I'm there and I'm beginning to panic and I'm realizing that there's just no way
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:49.040]   I'm going to escape this, I notice the smallest of details.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.480]   The smallest of details that normally you wouldn't even kind of bother with or even
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.960]   see, but I recognize the smallest of details that would actually end up saving my life.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.340]   Do you know what it is?
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.680]   I remembered I had a knife in me and I could stab...
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.680]   No, that's not what happened.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   I didn't remember that.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.040]   Massacre!
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.700]   The smallest detail was this.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:23.500]   As I looked up at this sea of bums, I saw a very, very small one, a really small bottom.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:29.960]   And I realized that this was my chance to escape, that if I could somehow position myself
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.640]   in the water underneath this small little bum, I'm assuming that a child was sitting
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:39.160]   there, I might be able to burst up and push the child out and burst up to the middle of
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.220]   their ring and grasp a hold of the air that I desperately needed for my lungs.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:48.920]   I'm not proud to admit this, but I got under that small little bum and I pushed up as hard
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.560]   as I could and the kid went flying.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:58.280]   And Andrew burst up through the inside of the ring, grasping for air, and I went from
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.640]   death to resurrection.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.880]   Now, thank you, thank you.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.160]   The kid was fine, by the way.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.600]   I don't want to get any emails from anyone later on going like, "Hey, child abuse."
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.600]   Kid was fine.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.600]   Okay.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.480]   But here's the thing I learned that day.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.520]   I learned a very important lesson.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.000]   I didn't learn the lesson that it's dangerous to play with water, although that is a good
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.360]   lesson to learn.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.040]   I didn't learn the lesson that you should listen to people in authority with walkie-talkies,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.920]   although that also is a good lesson to learn.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:36.620]   That day I learned this, that sometimes in life, the smallest of details has the biggest
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.720]   of impact.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.080]   The thing that you probably would mostly ignore normally, the thing that doesn't maybe seem
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:50.080]   a big deal to anyone, can actually be the thing that opens up for you the greatest of
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.600]   possibilities.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:59.440]   Case in point is the Easter story itself as presented by John in his gospel.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.840]   The beautiful thing about Easter that we have as Christians is that we get four different
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.000]   versions of the Easter empty tomb narrative from four different writers.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.520]   And John, writing a little bit later than the other gospels, captures for us a detail
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.800]   that no one else captures, mentions something that no one else mentions, a small little
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.040]   thing that when you're reading the passage, you might actually just kind of pass over
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.640]   it and not look at it much at all, but actually when you sit with it for a moment, opens up
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.440]   the beauty and the wonder of what Easter is really all about.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.200]   And so I want to read you the story, and I wonder whether as I read it, you might be
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.040]   able to capture what this small little detail is.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.200]   This is John chapter 20, just the first eight verses.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.080]   "Early on, on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.480]   the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.560]   So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one who Jesus loved, and
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.160]   said, 'They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   him.'
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.400]   So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.440]   Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first."
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.760]   I love the fact that he wants that recorded for all the history.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.360]   I won the race.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.960]   He then says this, "Then Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.800]   And he saw the strips of linen that were lying there, as well as the burial cloth or the
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.640]   burial shroud that had been around Jesus' head.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.680]   The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the other linen.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.940]   Finally, the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside.
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.360]   He saw and believed."
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.120]   The little detail that John mentions here that none of the other gospel writers mention
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.120]   is this thing.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.120]   Let me read it to you again.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.080]   He says, "There was a burial shroud that had been around Jesus' head, and the cloth had
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.480]   been folded up by itself and separated from the other linen."
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:58.560]   John mentions a burial shroud, which again, kind of is a small little detail, but in this
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.480]   small thing comes such wonderful possibilities.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.660]   A burial shroud was pretty much something like this that I have here on the table.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:15.200]   It was a cloth that was placed over the face, the head and the face, of the person who had
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   died.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.520]   Now, it was usually a little bit of a thicker cloth than the other linen strips.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.200]   Notice that John mentions linen strips that were also there.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.880]   The linen strips were the ones that wrapped around the body.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.240]   They were very thin kind of linen material.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:34.280]   The burial shroud was a little bit heavier of material, and it was placed over the face
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.880]   or the head of the person who had passed away.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.760]   Now, why was this placed over the face of the person?
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.160]   Well, the burial shroud signified a couple of different things.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.680]   It signified, first of all, that it was kind of like covering up the face as a way of sort
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.920]   of protecting or covering the person's identity so that they would have dignity in death.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.360]   So it's like just kind of covering them in a way of providing some dignity for them.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.360]   The second reason why the burial shroud was placed over the face was because in many cases,
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.600]   maybe there was an injury to the face or something had happened to the head.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.920]   In Jesus' case, of course, that was the reality with the crown of thrones that had been on
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.920]   him, and so they cover up the head to protect the head wounds.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.960]   The third thing, but the most important reason why the burial shroud was placed over the
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:27.080]   face was because it signified the reality that that person had actually died.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.720]   The burial shroud was a sacred cloth that was only used in this instance to basically
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.760]   say this person has passed from life to death, a little bit like how perhaps in the modern
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:43.720]   time and in our modern age, we might take somebody who has passed away and close their
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.560]   eyes, just kind of do that little close the eyes thing, saying this person has passed
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.240]   from this life to the next.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.520]   That's what the burial shroud represented.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:17:02.400]   So when John says to us that there is this burial shroud, he's wanting to draw attention
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.840]   to the fact that death has occurred.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.880]   Now this is really important because when John's writing his gospel, remember it's later
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.440]   than the other gospel writers.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.240]   And by the time John's writing his gospel, the people, the Jewish people of the day are
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.000]   basically saying, "We don't think Jesus ever died.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.080]   Maybe he was on the cross and maybe he sweated that blood and maybe all that happened, yeah,
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.600]   but maybe he didn't actually die on the cross, and so when he got put into the tomb, he was
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.480]   actually still alive, and that's the reason why he was able to get up and escape."
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.360]   For other rumors that were spreading at the time was this, "Oh, maybe he faked his death.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.360]   Yeah, the disciples, they faked the whole thing.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.520]   It wasn't really true.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.520]   It wasn't real.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.520]   No one really saw it.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.640]   No, he escaped and ran off."
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.160]   And John says, "No, you need to understand that there is a burial shroud that was around
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.240]   this man's face, and no one placed a burial shroud on anyone unless they had confirmed
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.440]   that they were really dead."
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.140]   So for John, this is a big deal.
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.280]   It might seem like a small detail to us, but it's a much bigger impact than what we might
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.280]   realize.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.400]   This is saying, "No, Jesus was dead," and it was important for John and his audience
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.160]   to understand that that had taken place.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.480]   But then he mentions something else.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.140]   He doesn't say that the burial shroud was there.
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:24.040]   He said it had been taken up, that it had been folded up, and it had been placed separately
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.480]   from the other strips of linen.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:32.240]   Again, another small detail we might easily pass over, and we've read this a million times,
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.360]   but John is trying to communicate something that's going to help the people connect to
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:43.360]   something that was significant on the Easter story, folded up and separated from what they
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.280]   think else.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:50.840]   The question John wants you to ask as you're reading his narrative is, "Why did that happen?"
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:56.920]   Well, to understand that, I want to unpack for you actually a bigger story, not just
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.800]   the story of the death and resurrection of Jesus, but a story that goes way back to the
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.200]   beginning of all things.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.280]   Seven hundred years before the empty tomb experience that John has, something happens
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.480]   for Israel, the nation.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:16.500]   At that moment in history, Babylon, which was the largest empire of that time, who lived
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:22.840]   on the east side of where Israel's land was at the time, came in and actually attacked
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.280]   the Jewish people.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.120]   They stormed into Jerusalem.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.440]   They destroyed the temple that was on Mount Zion.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.800]   They killed many of the Jewish people at that time, and they took a remnant of the people
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.720]   out into captivity and exile in Babylon itself.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.800]   The Bible tells us that for seventy years, the Jewish people were in exile in Babylon.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.480]   This was the darkest time for Israel in maybe all of their history.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.400]   This was a time where they were wrestling with the realities of so many things that
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.980]   were going through their mind.
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.160]   They were wrestling with, "Why has God allowed this to happen?
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.600]   Why has God come and done this?
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.600]   What has taken place?"
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.800]   Now that the temple is destroyed, where is God's presence on earth?
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.240]   That's where they believe God's presence dwelt.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.320]   The Babylonians had come in and destroyed the temple, and suddenly they were asking
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.320]   these questions, "Where is God then?"
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:18.320]   Because if God doesn't reside in his temple, where now is our Lord?
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.280]   They're in exile in Babylon, and so much of the writing at this time is them crying out
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.560]   and saying, "Why have you forsaken us, God?
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.780]   Why have you left us?
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.160]   Why have you parted from us?"
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:33.040]   And as they're beginning to think this, they also have this other revelation.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.000]   They realize that the reason why they're in exile in the first place is because of their
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.360]   sin, their brokenness.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.040]   Because they had acted and done and had treated their God in ways that they should not have
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.600]   done.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:52.240]   And this has placed them in a place where they now are in exile, and they realize that
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:59.300]   this is largely because of the brokenness found within them, which opens up for us another
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:04.020]   big story, the story of humanity's brokenness itself.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.080]   The Bible explains that story by linking it to the first humans, Adam and Eve, created
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:15.020]   by God to be in relationship with him, relationship with themselves, relationship with one another,
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.460]   relationship with his creation.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.600]   Genesis 1 and 2 pitches us this beautiful picture of what Shalom looks like between
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.280]   God and humanity perfect together.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.780]   And God tells Adam and Eve just one thing not to do, just like a little 14-year-old
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.460]   boy, the one thing you're not supposed to do is go down that slide into the next pool.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.660]   The one thing he told them not to do, take of the fruit of the knowledge of the tree
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.660]   and good and evil.
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.500]   But we all know the human story, don't we?
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.940]   Us humans, if you tell us not to do something, it's the first thing we're going to do.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.460]   Adam and Eve take the fruit that they should not have done.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:52.140]   The Bible tells us that this story of humanity's brokenness begins at that point.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:57.540]   And the Bible is very clear that that brokenness happens in basically those four essential
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.340]   relationships, our relationship with God, our relationship with ourselves, our relationship
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.540]   with the others around us, and even our relationship with creation.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:10.260]   And there's a brokenness and a heaviness that's now come into all spheres of that area in
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.260]   our lives.
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:16.500]   And the Bible says from Genesis 4 onwards, it's the story of humanity wrestling with
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:21.500]   the heaviness of the sin, knowing what it is to breaking that relationship with God
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:28.260]   themselves, with others in the world, and the heaviness that comes on them in that reality.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.460]   And the rest of the biblical narrative is a fascinating story because it's a story of
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:37.260]   God's people wanting to be back in relationship with Him, and yet realizing that their own
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.740]   efforts and their own ability to do that will never be enough.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.180]   They realize that they're the ones that broke that relationship, but they can't restore
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.180]   it.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.180]   They can't be God.
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.700]   God's going to have to do something to help restore that relationship because it's way
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.060]   beyond their ability.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:59.620]   And this brings us back to that moment 700 years before the tomb was empty, where Israel's
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:05.140]   in captivity in Babylon, and it's there for the first time they go, "We need God to do
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.580]   something new.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.740]   We need Him to step in.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.500]   We can't try to create this in our own strength anymore.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.500]   We're useless.
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:20.620]   No, God has to come in His compassion and His love and change it all."
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:27.620]   So it shouldn't surprise us that in this moment, 700 years before Jesus' empty tomb, God begins
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:33.580]   to speak through prophets, and He tells these prophets a vision and a dream of what's going
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.580]   to happen.
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:39.480]   And each prophet has a different perspective and a different, broader and wider dream.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.860]   And in this moment, God calls one prophet.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.900]   In this incredible dark time of Israel's history, one prophet named Isaiah.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:53.700]   And Isaiah begins to get this amazing vision of what the world might be like when God comes
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.580]   and steps in and changes everything.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.340]   And I want to read to you the vision he gets right at this time of exile for the Jewish
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.420]   people.
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.940]   It's found in Isaiah.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:08.420]   It starts in chapter 25, and I wonder if you can hear this as I speak it.
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:17.180]   He says, verse 7, Isaiah 25, "On this mountain, He will destroy the burial shroud that enfolds
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.100]   all the people, the sheet that covers all nations.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:26.020]   He will swallow up death forever, and the sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.120]   all faces.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:32.580]   He will remove the distance from people from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.420]   In that day, they will say, 'Surely this is our God.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.920]   We trust it in Him, and He saved us.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.260]   This is the Lord.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:43.460]   We trust it in Him, and we rejoice and be glad in His salvation.'"
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:49.940]   Can you hear what Isaiah says 700 years before the resurrection of Jesus?
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:57.220]   God gives him a picture of what sin for humanity is like, and here's how Isaiah describes it.
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:05.060]   He's like, "It's like a burial shroud has been placed over us, like a sheet has come
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.500]   and been placed over all of humanity."
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:15.620]   And in this prophetic vision, he sees humanity shrouded in death, essentially, with that
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:21.100]   burial shroud over their faces, over their heads, covering them like you would someone
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.100]   who's died.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.220]   And it's Isaiah's beautiful prophetic way of saying, "Don't you realize that this is
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.780]   what sin does to us?"
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.160]   The Bible in the New Testament would say it elsewhere.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.220]   It would say that the wages of sin is what?
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.820]   It's death.
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.300]   And so the burial shroud, which had always signified the passing of something, Isaiah
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:46.860]   sees it over all of humanity, like that heavy cloth placed upon us, which makes it hard
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.560]   for us to see anything.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.580]   We can kind of make out vague shapes, but not really see as we were supposed to see,
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.820]   the weight of it over our heads, pulling down upon us.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:03.420]   This beautiful poetic imagery is what Isaiah is saying humanity's sin and brokenness is
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.420]   like.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:09.500]   So stick with us for a moment, because I think that's something that we can all resonate
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.060]   with, right?
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:16.240]   I think in many ways, no matter what kind of life you may have led, we can all recognize
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.980]   the heaviness that life creates for us at times, the brokenness that is so present for
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.220]   us.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.380]   And perhaps for some of you, as you've come in today, this resonates with you.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:32.460]   You know what it's like to wear a bit of a shroud over your head, if you will.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:37.340]   You know the heaviness of life, the hardship and the challenges.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.820]   Perhaps for some of you, it's because of what others have done to you.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.580]   Perhaps you've been hurt.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.940]   Perhaps somebody else's brokenness has broken you.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.800]   Perhaps words have been shared, things have happened.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.340]   Maybe someone's done something to you that's caused a lot of trauma and hardship in your
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:57.580]   life and it feels like there's a filter now over your life.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.640]   Or perhaps for some of us, we resonate with it because we know of our own actions.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.420]   We know that we've hurt others.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.740]   We know that despite the fact that we didn't want to, words came out of our mouths or actions
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:13.940]   happened or things took place and we know we've broken others because of it.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:20.260]   I think we all resonate, don't we, with the reality that the shroud can cover us, that
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:25.380]   the heaviness of the cloth can be around us, that the weight of it can push down upon us.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.140]   We can all wrestle with that.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.460]   I think we can all connect with it.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:35.060]   And this is why Isaiah is sharing it because he's like, "This image kind of fits for all
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.660]   of us, doesn't it?"
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.180]   But then he says this beautiful thing.
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:47.260]   He says, "I see a time in the future when God will act and the burial shroud, the sheet
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.100]   that covers all peoples and nations will be destroyed.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.100]   It will be removed."
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.100]   The word "destroyed" there, guess what it means?
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.140]   Actually, if you look at it in the Hebrew and you break it down, it means to be set
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.140]   aside.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.780]   He says, "There's a time coming in the future where the burial shroud will be set aside,
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.060]   where it will be destroyed once and for all."
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.740]   And he says this is going to happen for all peoples and all nations.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.740]   I love that.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.900]   You see, Isaiah could have just played to the crowd.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.440]   He could have just said, "Hey, this is going to happen for us Jewish people.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.700]   This is good news for all of us Jewish people."
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:19.700]   But he doesn't say that.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.460]   He says, "This is for all people, for all nations."
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.460]   Like no matter what other cultural background, no matter who you are, if you're a human being,
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.300]   this is good news for you, Isaiah is saying.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.180]   He's saying God has taken the burial shroud, that heaviness that weighs upon you, and he's
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.820]   removed it and he's placed it away and you can have fresh life, all peoples on earth.
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.900]   You see, the liberation of God is not a half liberation.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.420]   You know, a liberation just reserved for the special few of us.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.060]   It's a liberation for all people and all nations.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.720]   The sheet has been removed.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.320]   Anyone who trusts in him, it is gone.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.600]   That is the powerful message of Easter.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.400]   That's the wonder and the beauty of what we sit in this room today to praise and to be
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.480]   thankful for.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:13.680]   Not something that happened some 700,000, 2,000, 2,500 years ago for other people, but
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.240]   something that's happened for all of us right here and right now.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:22.120]   This is why Isaiah fills this with beautiful imagery in terms of the liberation that comes
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.120]   for us all.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.120]   Notice what he says.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.160]   He says, "The sovereign Lord will wipe away every tear.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.260]   He will remove the disgrace from his people.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.920]   He will save us."
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.920]   What beautiful thoughts.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.160]   He's going to wipe everything away.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.960]   He's going to liberate the shame and the disgrace that sits on us because of the things that
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:45.580]   we've done that we're not proud of, and he's going to save us, bring us that salvation.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:51.940]   It's a call to the wonder of a God who can change everything.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:58.240]   So stick with us all and come back to me and come back with me to John chapter 20.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.000]   Notice what John says.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.800]   He says, "When I walked in there, when I arrived in the tomb, I saw the strips of linen
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.640]   lying there as well as the burial shroud that had been around Jesus's head, and the cloth
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:17.260]   now was folded up by itself and separated from the other linen."
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.680]   John is giving us a very small detail that has a massive impact.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.460]   He's saying that that shroud that was around Jesus's head has been folded up and set aside,
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.980]   not just because it says something about Jesus, but because it says something about the biblical
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.200]   story of all time.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.440]   It actually links to what Isaiah had prophesied 700 years before that God's people had been
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.840]   longing for the day when God would step in and deal with sin once and for all, that the
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.880]   burial shroud that was around us all would be lifted off and separated and destroyed
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:50.160]   so we would know the fullness of love, the fullness of forgiveness, the fullness of life.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.560]   And he says, "I saw it and I believed."
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:00.140]   He said, "I made the connection between Isaiah's prophetic vision and God's work in Jesus,
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.040]   and I no longer saw Jesus as just a good moral leader.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.680]   I no longer saw him as just some prophet of old.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.680]   I now see him as the Son of God."
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.960]   The burial shroud has been set aside.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.520]   I love the word he uses here in the Greek.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.520]   It's the word folded.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.560]   He said, "It's folded," which interestingly is the same if you read the Old Testament
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:26.260]   in the LXX, which is the Greek version of the Old Testament, the word that Isaiah uses
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.940]   to speak of the unfolding of the shroud around all people.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.760]   It's the same root word.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:37.080]   So here's John making this beautiful theological connection to the language he's using.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:42.840]   What was once enfolded over all of humanity has now been folded and separated and set
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.140]   apart, destroyed.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:52.060]   And where the Bible says that the wages of sin is death, Easter tells us that death is
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:58.220]   not the final story, that death is not how this thing's all going to end up, that actually
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.380]   here's what's going to happen.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.060]   Every tear is going to be wiped away.
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.220]   All that shame is going to be removed.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.420]   The salvation will come for anyone who would put his trust in him.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:12.540]   The beauty of Easter is the celebration of a new time has embarked in this world.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.740]   A new time has come.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:18.260]   This is why Jesus, when he's on the cross, cries out, "It is finished."
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.460]   That old story is done.
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.060]   The shroud has been lifted.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.700]   Death is not a definition of humanity anymore.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.180]   Yes, we will all die at some point, but death is not the full stop.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:33.100]   It's merely a comma because Jesus rose again.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.060]   And you're going to rise again.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.580]   And you're going to be filled with new life and have eternal hope and salvation and joy
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.420]   in the presence of God.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:50.060]   One enters the tomb and believes because he sees the shroud has been destroyed.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:56.420]   It's a beautiful, powerful, poignant picture of what can take place through the resurrection
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.220]   power of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:06.620]   And I love this because it welcomes us into a thought, a thought that this kind of freedom
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:11.860]   and liberation is not reserved for just those that have done something special throughout
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:16.860]   all of history, but it's actually something available for all.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:21.580]   Our baptism candidates in just a little bit at 4.30 this afternoon, that's what they're
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.580]   celebrating.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.180]   They're celebrating that their burial shroud has been removed.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.620]   And they're going down publicly into the waters of Repulse Bay, the beautiful, dirty waters
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.860]   of Repulse Bay.
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.380]   And they're going to be washed clean by the waters of the Spirit of God.
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.380]   Amen.
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:41.140]   And it's not just our baptism candidates that are celebrating this.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:46.980]   Millions of Christians around the world are celebrating this on this very day, that their
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:52.700]   own burial shroud has been removed because of what Jesus has done on that cross.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:57.460]   And I want you to know this, that that's also what has happened for you too, whether you've
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.740]   ever realized it or not.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.540]   Perhaps for some of you here, this is a new story.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:06.220]   It's a new idea, but you resonate and connect with it because you felt that heaviness and
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.580]   you know what that burden of life can feel like.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:13.100]   And maybe this is the first time you're ever hearing that something has taken place that
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.980]   has removed that heaviness and that burden from you.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.980]   Jesus put it this way in the gospels.
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:24.940]   He said, "Anybody who's weary and tired, who's overburdened, who's worn down, you can come
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.540]   to me and I will give you rest."
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.340]   And he says, "My yoke is light, my burden easy."
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:37.140]   In other words, the heaviness of that shroud has been lifted, it has been removed, and
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:41.260]   therefore there's a new story for you.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.140]   What is that new story?
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:47.880]   Well, interestingly, if you actually go back into the Isaiah passage, you'll see something
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.880]   quite beautiful.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:53.580]   See, Isaiah doesn't just speak of this moment where the burial shroud was lifted.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.780]   In the very same passage, he speaks about something else.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.140]   Let me read this to you in verse six.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:04.140]   He says, "On this mountain, the Lord Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:11.060]   peoples, a banquet of aged wine, the best of meats, and the finest of wines for all
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.060]   the people."
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:16.780]   You see, the imagery that the Bible uses to talk about the fact that the burial shroud
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:23.540]   has been lifted is a table filled with harvest, a place of abundance that anyone can come
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.100]   to and partake in a meal that will give them life.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:32.740]   Isaiah, having seen the burial shroud getting lifted some 700 years before the work of Jesus
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:38.440]   on the cross, then sees a picture of a banqueting table filled with the finest of food and the
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:43.540]   greatest of wine, and he says, "Isn't it amazing that the end of our story is not the
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:47.360]   burial shroud, but a table filled with abundance?
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.700]   That we get invited into a greater narrative than the one that we thought our humanity
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.100]   had invited us into?
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.860]   The table has been set."
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:03.760]   And this imagery of a table that's filled with abundance and fruitfulness and wonder
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:11.020]   and looks really good to eat, that story becomes the central narrative that the Bible uses
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.300]   to talk about the work of salvation in Christ.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:21.620]   Jesus himself, at the beginning of the gospel, in his announcement of himself as more than
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:28.860]   just a prophet, he starts his ministry at a wedding in Cana, and a wedding banquet is
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:35.000]   there, and they run out of wine, and Jesus says, "Bring me, just bring me the ceremonial
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.300]   pots that are filled with water," and he's like, "I will show you that the greatest of
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.960]   all wine will be poured out for anyone to enjoy."
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.700]   And this beautiful picture of what this wine is like is really Jesus already, before he
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.620]   sheds his blood on the cross, saying, "This is what it's going to be like.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:54.860]   We're all going to gather around an incredible table, and we're going to feast for all eternity,
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.860]   because this is the picture of what God is.
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.580]   God is not an angry despot who's filled with wrath and wanting to punish everybody.
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:08.380]   No, God is an abundant, glorious, loving, faithful father who sets the table for any
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:13.100]   prodigal son and daughter to come and partake with him."
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.620]   The burial shroud has been destroyed.
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:23.020]   Let me put it this way, the burial shroud has become a tablecloth, and that tablecloth
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:27.420]   now is a welcome to anyone who would put their trust in him.
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:31.300]   In fact, at the end of the biblical narrative, right at the end of the story, this is how
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.300]   the Bible finishes.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.500]   Let me read this to you from Revelation 19.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.140]   I love how this puts it.
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:41.180]   "Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like the
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:46.340]   loud pearls of thunder shouting, 'Hallelujah, for our Lord God Almighty reigns.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:52.500]   Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory, for the wedding banquet of the Lamb has come,
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.180]   and his bride has made herself ready.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.980]   Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear.'"
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:37:59.980]   I love this.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.620]   Revelation pitches the end of all things, and they pitch this wedding banquet of the
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:08.620]   Lamb, and it's saying that there's a great multitude of people who are welcome to this.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.620]   Notice what it says.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.660]   It says, "The burial shroud," basically it doesn't say this, but the burial shroud has
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:18.100]   been set aside, and new linen has been given, because the bride is the church.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:22.100]   The bride is those that have put their trust in Jesus Christ, and we're now wrapped up
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.940]   in fresh, bright, clean linen.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:33.080]   Burial shroud destroyed, new linen, and a banquet given.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:40.300]   So for you, the smallest of details can actually create the biggest of impact.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:46.600]   A burial shroud set aside that actually draws us into the wonder of what this whole celebration
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:52.720]   is all about, and a table set in abundance for you.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.960]   Let me challenge you here if you're a Christian.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.800]   If you're a Christian, this whole thing is a challenge, I think, because I think it's
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:06.880]   easy sometimes for us Christians in our relationship with Jesus to have those ups and downs that
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.360]   we have with Him, and sometimes think that He's the God of the no, that He's a God that
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.640]   holds back, that He's not coming through with the things that we want Him to come through
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.840]   for.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:21.660]   And we might have a picture of the table that He sets before us, and it's barren.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.680]   And if you feel a little bit like that as a Christian, that your relationship with Jesus
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:30.360]   is a little barren right now, that maybe because of some disappointments, or because you thought
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.040]   something would happen, or He would do something and it didn't feel like He did it, when you
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.960]   look at the table, you don't see a lot on that table at all.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.120]   You look at a table of lack.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.880]   I think the challenge of Easter is to tell you that actually it's a table of abundance.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.920]   And perhaps for some of you who have been Christians for a long time, this is a challenge
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.120]   to you.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.120]   Can you see your picture with the Lord?
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.760]   Can you see the table like this for you?
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.440]   If you're not a Christian here, we're so glad you're here.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.320]   And I hope that maybe something that I've shared this afternoon or this morning has
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.520]   really challenged you, or maybe just opened yourself up to thinking about life slightly
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.520]   differently.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.400]   And this invitation maybe has resonated with some of you.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.240]   Maybe like me, you know what it is to feel the heaviness of life and the burden of things.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.280]   Maybe that brokenness has been there for you, and maybe it's even resonating for you in
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   this moment.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:23.440]   And the wonder of Easter is that that burial shroud has been removed, and that just simply
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.360]   through trust in Jesus, remember John standing on the outside of the tomb, and he knows,
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:33.120]   "Man, if I go inside there, and if I see the thing that I think I'm going to see, then
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   I'm going to have to believe."
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.920]   Perhaps for some of you in this room, you're feeling it in your spirit right now.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   You're feeling your heart beating.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.800]   You know that this might be the moment where you've come to a place where you're willing
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.600]   to put your trust in Him, your life in His hands.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.840]   I'm not going to promise you that life is suddenly going to be easy.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.640]   It's going to be rainbows and butterflies.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.160]   No.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.200]   Sometimes when we give our lives to Jesus, things get challenged even more.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.680]   Jesus described walking with Him like a narrow path, not a big broad one.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:08.520]   But He says it's a narrow path that leads to life, eternal life, the hope of forgiveness
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.200]   and the glory of restoration.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   And so I want to pray for you.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.760]   I want to pray that perhaps that might be your journey here today.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:21.000]   So I wonder whether we would all just bow our heads as we come into a time of prayer.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.880]   Father, I'm so grateful for each person that's here in this room, that those that are watching
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.240]   online, those in our overflow.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.760]   Lord, I'm grateful that we get to come around the table today together.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.880]   And Lord, first of all, we thank you that the burial shroud has been removed.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.640]   We thank you, Lord, that it's been set aside.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.640]   It's destroyed.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.760]   And Lord, we thank you that in the fact that you did that in the death and resurrection
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:53.080]   of Jesus now provides for us a open tomb that asks us whether we will enter and believe.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:42:00.360]   Father, for the Christians here, where perhaps they feel like their table is not abundant,
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:04.800]   perhaps they struggle to see the overflow of what's on this table in this moment in
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.280]   their relationship with you.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:10.120]   I want to pray that this Easter would be a breakthrough for them.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:14.520]   I want to pray that you would, Lord, bring them back to the abundance of your love and
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.520]   your heart and your grace.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:21.040]   Lord, I want to pray for breakthrough for those Christians here who need to see the
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.160]   table more full.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:27.920]   And I pray that they would see that you have done everything and you've wrapped them in
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.960]   white fresh linens.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:35.440]   And I pray that they would find great joy in their relationship with you again here
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.440]   on Easter Sunday.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:41.560]   And Father, I pray for anyone here who perhaps when they came in today would say that they
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.560]   weren't a Christian.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:48.360]   And if that's you, I just want to invite you just to this moment of just reflection.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:55.800]   Lord, God loves you so much.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:01.640]   No matter how hard things have been, no matter how difficult life is, he's here for you in
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   this moment.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:10.600]   And his invitation is the same as it was for John some 2,000 years ago.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.520]   He's welcoming you in to believe.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.520]   And he's saying, "Will you come in and believe today?"
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.740]   And I know that for some of you in this room and watching online right now, this is going
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:25.000]   to be a life-changing moment for you.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.620]   As you come to just put your trust in him, the Bible says that we come into relationship
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.040]   with God as we repent and believe.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:39.240]   The word repent just literally means to ask for God to cover us in his love, to recognize
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:44.320]   that we've hurt people and hurt ourselves at times, to even recognize that we've hurt
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.580]   him and to ask for forgiveness.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.600]   And then out of that place of just recognizing the forgiveness that we have in a loving,
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:58.280]   merciful Lord, we then have the celebration and the joy of knowing that eternal life is
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.560]   before us.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:05.000]   And so I want to pray for any of you here today where that might be your journey.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.560]   And what we want to do is in a moment we're going to pray a prayer all together.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.760]   And if you're praying that prayer for the first time, we want to invite you to come
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.880]   up and connect with us after the service, myself or other team members.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.720]   We'd love to just talk with you about next steps and what living a life with Jesus is.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.880]   You know, a life with Jesus is not just a decision you make in a service.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.520]   That's the starting point.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.360]   But it's actually a discipleship journey of great abundance and love and joy.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.560]   And we want to come around you and help you with that.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   So as we're all just heads bowed, eyes closed, I want us to all to pray this prayer.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.560]   And if you want to invite Jesus into your life for the very first time, then this is
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.320]   the prayer that you're praying to do so.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:46.360]   But we're all going to pray it as an encouragement together as the body of Christ.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.360]   So let's pray this prayer.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   Pray after me.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:56.600]   Lord Jesus, I want to thank you for dying for me and for raising again.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:00.840]   I thank you that the tomb was empty.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:11.880]   And Lord, we thank you that the burial shroud that has been over me has been set aside because
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.320]   of Jesus.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:22.360]   Father, I ask that you would forgive me in this moment.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:29.680]   Forgive me for the ways that I've hurt you, that I've hurt myself, and that I've hurt
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.640]   others around me.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.000]   And I thank you that you forgive me.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:46.640]   And in this moment, I pray you would give me now your Spirit, your Holy Spirit, filled
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:53.400]   with love, grace, strength for life ahead.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:59.480]   And I thank you that I now have eternal life in you.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:07.160]   Help me to walk every day in the humility of your service.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.480]   And I pray this in Jesus' name.
