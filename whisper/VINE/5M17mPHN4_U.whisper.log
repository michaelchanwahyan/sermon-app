[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   Well, thank you so much, Alison.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.760]   And I also want to thank the worship team, Waymaker.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.960]   Indeed, he's our waymaker and he continues to work.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.400]   That's actually in line with what we're going to share today, that God has a grand
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.500]   plan and he's constantly working.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.040]   So welcome once again and good morning to all of you and all those also watching us
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.040]   over online.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:33.040]   Well, I will share a bit of my own story just to help us understand that God is indeed having
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   a great and grand plan for each and every one of us.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.440]   So by now you would recognize that I do have some Singapore accent.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.640]   Well, I'm actually born and bred here in Hong Kong.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.160]   I studied in local universities.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.440]   I worked in one of the most busy hospitals here in Hong Kong for 10 years until I really
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.840]   got stuck professionally.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.400]   I yearned for a breakthrough and we made a very difficult decision, a family of four.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.160]   We actually decided to emigrate over to Singapore.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:16.800]   And that was 27 years ago and to be exact, it is 1st of July, 1997.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:25.640]   Whoa, anyway, we did fairly well over there as a family and as well as professionally.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.460]   But most significantly was that I actually rededicated my life to Jesus.
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.720]   And my wife first came to know Jesus as personal Lord and Savior over there.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.480]   So over there we enter into a new reality.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:49.520]   Well, of course, it's a different location, but there's a new reality with a new identity.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.200]   Now while we settled fairly well over there by God's grace and divine purposes, we actually
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.400]   got a chance to relocate back here to Hong Kong.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:07.200]   So 10 years down the road, we moved back and here we are attending divine worshipping and
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.820]   I also got to serve in the Cantonese community as well as in the eldership.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.220]   So over the years, as I reflect, God has been graceful and He has a great plan for me.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.160]   We just celebrate our 60th birthday.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.480]   Wow, I look too young.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.800]   Yes, Botox works.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.760]   Yeah, but I also realized that while the blessing actually extend to over the next generation,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.080]   my daughter and my son-in-law, while they were here in the 9/15 service, so they tied
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.360]   their knots just a few months ago while they also planning to move over to London to start
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.280]   a new season.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.680]   So I'm actually quite amazed that how come this wonderful young Chinese gentleman from
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.920]   Australia got to work here in Hong Kong and met my, well, also quite wonderful daughter.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.280]   But the thing is, God has a grand plan for each and every one of us.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:19.400]   In due time, He reveals His purposes in us and it's actually for us to give thanks to
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.480]   Him and even to praise Him for what He has done in our life in the past, in the present,
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.520]   and that would continue into the future.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.800]   But that's what Paul wants to share with the congregation in Ephesians, that while
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.280]   indeed God is doing great and wonderful things.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.320]   So let's read the Bible text for today.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.200]   That's in chapter 1.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.760]   Praise be to God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.400]   realms with every single spiritual blessing in Christ.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.880]   For He chose us in Him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:15.640]   In love, He predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ in accordance
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.360]   to His pleasure and will, to the praise of His glorious grace.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.200]   In Him, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins in accordance with
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.080]   the riches of God's grace that He lavished on us.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.480]   With all wisdom and understanding, He made known to us the mystery of His will according
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:49.400]   to His goodwill and pleasure, which He purposed in Christ to be put into full effect when
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:57.320]   the times reach the fulfillment, to bring unity to all things in Christ for all things
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.000]   in heaven and on earth to be under Him.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.520]   In Him, we were also chosen, predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:15.200]   in conformity with the purpose of His will in order that we, the first to put our hope
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.320]   in Christ, may be for the praise of His glory.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.520]   And you also were included in Christ when you heard the gospel of your salvation, when
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.560]   you believed, you were marked with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit who is the deposit
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:44.080]   guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession to the praise
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.080]   of His glory.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.800]   So you can see purposes, goodwill, plans, all come from God.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.800]   Well, indeed, it is a lengthy passage that really originates from one sentence in the
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.680]   original Greek.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.680]   I'll share with you in the next 20 minutes or so three things.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.320]   One, how God or what God has done in Christ.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:17.000]   Number two, we try to find the distinction between in Christ versus Christ in us.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.200]   And lastly, we talk about Christ being the head and that should bring comfort.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.360]   Let's come back to verse one, verse 10, which is the core message.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.800]   The whole passage is about spiritual blessings planned by the Father, accomplished by the
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.360]   Son and applied by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:48.400]   So indeed, it actually says, "Blessed is the God who bless us with every spiritual blessing."
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.640]   Heavenly blessings.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.720]   But why a doxology?
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.840]   Doxology actually literally means glory.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.080]   Okay, why a doxology up front?
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.880]   Well, many of us, pre-believers and believers included, wrongly assume that the reality
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.840]   is the physical world around which we feel, we touch, or we experience.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.320]   Yet, the doxology asserts that the reality is much, much bigger.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:22.960]   It includes God, his actions, and what takes place in Christ and in the heavenly realms.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.920]   We must expand our thinking to do justice to this larger reality.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:35.000]   Because in our contemporary practice, we view ourselves as the primary actor on the stage
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.720]   of history.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.920]   But Paul's doxology reminded that God is the primary actor.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.200]   Just the other day, a few of the fellow elders went to visit a church member and pray for
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.480]   God's healing.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.080]   And that is beyond what the doctors may say and mention about his physical reality and
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080]   challenges.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:04.320]   We must see the bigger reality of God's grand plan for this individual and for each and
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.840]   every one of us.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.880]   Now paradoxically, I actually worked in the medical line.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:17.240]   And more often than not, I actually would slip into the mode of viewing myself as the
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.880]   healer.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.520]   I have neglected the bigger reality.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:29.920]   The bigger reality is that I'm only there to manage or to treat certain medical conditions.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.640]   Ultimately, only God heals.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.760]   And that is the bigger reality.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.640]   In Christ, well, let's zoom in a bit more to the prominent theme in this passage, "In
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.640]   Christ."
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:53.600]   The expression "In Christ, in the Lord, in Him" appear 164 times in Paul's writing.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:00.480]   Paul's writing really flows from his understanding of how we are to be connected and unified
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.480]   with him.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:08.720]   So we can read from this passage, "We enjoy every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.600]   We are chosen in Him and adopted through Him.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:21.520]   Everything is accomplished in Him as the revelation of the mystery of His will so that God's purpose
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.400]   is to unite all things in Him.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:33.800]   We enjoy an inheritance in Him and also we are sealed with the Spirit in Him."
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:40.480]   Among all the possible other meanings or translations, let us concentrate on the key understanding
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.400]   of "In Christ" in this context.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.160]   It's more what we call a location, a location sense.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:55.800]   We think of Christ, the location, as the vast repository or treasury holding the gifts of
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.460]   God.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.160]   And Christ is the source of all these ritual blessings.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.460]   And while we reside in Him, we enjoy all these blessings.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:13.100]   And mind you, our individuality is not lost when we are fully in Christ.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:19.400]   It is not some Eastern religious thought of absorption into the deity.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:27.920]   Rather, Christ and we abide in the unity whereby Christ sets the parameters for life and makes
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.640]   available God's provision for life.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.420]   What are the implications of our being in Christ?
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:44.260]   When we are in Christ, we are united with Him and participate in His death, resurrection,
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.260]   and life.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:52.700]   Now, this interplay of death and life is dynamic and I would say is mind-blogging.
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:59.020]   Let me illustrate by citing a not too uncommon scenario, chemotherapy.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.020]   How it works?
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:07.060]   Now, the toxic chemotherapy would literally kill the cancer cells and part of it, well,
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:12.260]   part of the individual who received the chemotherapy also dies in some extent.
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.540]   Well, that is how exactly new life begins.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:22.900]   The normal regenerate cell would begin to repopulate and replace all that which was
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.220]   lost.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:29.780]   The chemotherapy concept applies to various cancers and many a times the chemotherapy
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.860]   is actually designed with what we call an intent to cure.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.980]   That means we can cure a person from this disease.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:46.660]   That purposeful death and renewal concept is particularly true for some blood-borne
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.540]   cancer or we call it leukemia.
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:56.140]   Now, I have this understanding as a personal first-hand experience.
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:03.380]   Now, for all of you here, if you do your health check, your blood count, your white cell count
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.380]   will be somewhere like 5 to 10.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.660]   That is normal.
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:20.180]   My cell count as my leukemia progressed went up to 100, 150 and I panicked.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.220]   I thought about death.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:30.260]   Well, I bite the bullet and go ahead with the chemotherapy and specifically it is what
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.620]   we call a targeted therapy.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:42.340]   The day of the treatment, I was so ill, so sick, I literally thought I was going to die.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:49.900]   In fact, my cell count dropped to the level of below 1 on day 1 post-treatment which was
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:56.780]   dangerously low to the extent that my oncologist has to stop all the scheduled treatment altogether
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:02.700]   so that I will be allowed time to recover for the cell to replenish.
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:10.860]   And thereafter, in a sense, I died and I died again as I received multiple causes of the
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.260]   same treatment along the way.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.780]   That was almost 7 or 8 years ago.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:27.220]   I lost count but I'm happy to share with all of you that I am treatment-free and I'm disease-free.
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:32.580]   New life has crept into my life even as part of me died.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:39.540]   Just remember his death is our death and his life is also our life.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:49.340]   It is in this solidarity achieved by a double identification via the incarnation and faith.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.340]   What it means?
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:14:02.420]   In incarnation, Christ identifies with us and by faith, we respond and we identify with
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.660]   him.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:11.580]   To be in Christ does not mean to be inside Christ as tools are in a box or clothes are
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:18.780]   in a closet but rather we are organically united to Christ as a limb is in the body
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.980]   or a branch is in the tree.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.260]   We are all familiar with this.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.740]   Christ, I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:35.100]   If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.200]   You will bear much fruit.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:44.660]   It is this personal relationship with Christ that is the distinctive hallmark of his authentic
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.100]   followers.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:54.080]   As we live in Christ, our awareness of the presence of God and of living in Christ becomes
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.760]   the keys to all aspects of our life.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.700]   How strange would it be if we are to forget the place that we live?
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:08.740]   We lived in different places here in Hong Kong over the 16 years we are back here and
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:16.140]   my wife Vivian is superbly efficient in arranging for every time that we move house.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:22.100]   I had the experience of actually for a number of times that I left home in the morning,
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:28.540]   went to work, then when I left work I go to a new place, new house altogether.
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:33.780]   I just need to be reminded, well, you are to move to a new place.
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:42.660]   Well we need to be reminded because for in him we live and move and have our being.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:50.660]   I do want to highlight some important distinction between the notion Christ in us and we in
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.620]   Christ.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:58.780]   We often find comfort and indeed we should find the comfort as we embrace that Christ
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.580]   is in us.
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.940]   His presence and his company should be reassuring.
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:14.700]   However, when we only emphasise that Christ is in us, there may be a danger that we become
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.300]   me-focused.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:25.720]   We try to identify or define reality and Christ would be about one inch tall.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.900]   On the other hand, if we realise that we are in Christ or under Christ, he determines reality
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:37.020]   and he encompasses all that we are.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:43.820]   Indeed some of us might struggle with too much of a focus that Christ is in us.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:51.820]   Therefore having that danger of Christ almost submitting to our will, our control, as if
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.980]   Christ is only there to meet our own needs.
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:03.780]   On the other hand, if we have a distorted understanding of being in Christ, then we
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.660]   might think well we need to do nothing more than whatever he has already done.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:15.620]   We take for granted all that he has done for us and we live in a passive way in this world.
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:21.860]   Well both dangers are common in the church and perhaps you have experienced one way or
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.020]   the other.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.940]   I know I have.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.500]   Let me share my story to illustrate the distinction.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.340]   Christ in me or me in Christ.
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.500]   I mentioned that I decided to move or relocate back here to Hong Kong.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:43.060]   It was largely due to an offer to take up a leading academic position in one of the
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.420]   local universities.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:53.260]   Personally it is a major career advancement and I really had that dream of leaving a legacy
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.260]   professionally to be remembered.
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.060]   We did not take this offer lightly.
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.660]   We did all the good things that a good Christian is supposed to do.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.300]   We prayed, we discerned, we shared, we waited.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.300]   It was quite some time before we finally took up the offer.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.460]   I was confident that Christ was in me and with me.
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:23.820]   I was also committed that I would bring his presence to the workplace.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:31.460]   But my honest reflection and confession was that the focus was still me.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.900]   Those few years working back in Hong Kong were most challenging.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.980]   Not that I didn't anticipate all those challenges in the first place.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:49.460]   As it turned out, probably partly due to my shortcomings, I did not secure the tenural
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.460]   position.
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.500]   I lost my job.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:00.740]   I had to leave the prestigious position and the title and I have to journey on in the
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:07.380]   private practice setting, starting all over again.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.020]   It's painful.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.580]   My dream died.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:21.420]   But then I realized Jesus' dream for me is alive and vibrant.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.060]   His dream is alive and vibrant.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.500]   I come to understand I am in a bigger than myself reality.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.940]   I am in Christ.
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:39.060]   For in him we live and move and have our being.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:44.980]   First and foremost, I would say I'm really proud that I was once part of a team and that
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:51.900]   they have since ascended to even greater heights professionally and academically.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:59.500]   But for myself, that I'm in private practice allows me a lot of more time and space to
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.100]   ponder on, well, how I can serve him better.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:11.460]   And that is not necessarily via my profession nor the title that I bear.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:19.420]   Rather, I am in Christ and therefore he should dictate how best to entrust me in whatever
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.460]   arena or circumstances.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.220]   So I had the inspiration from my wife, who actually finished her seminary studies in
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.900]   her 50s, and I thought, well, I could do likewise.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:40.180]   So I completed my part-time seminary studies while I was in full-time medical practice.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:45.580]   That was despite the health care challenge of having to go through multiple courses of
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.020]   chemotherapy.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:57.940]   Studying in the seminary teach me to humble, that there is far more that I do not know
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:02.100]   than the very little that I study and got to know.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:08.980]   And that stirred up my yearning to know him more.
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:15.940]   On serving, I had the joy of serving the Cantonese community, which again had a humble beginning.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.580]   We started as one of the earliest Cantonese-speaking small groups.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.940]   That was 10 years ago.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.020]   We started at home, but it soon burst.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.580]   God blessed the community tremendously.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:34.660]   We moved back to the premise in this church building, and it continued to grow into a
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.940]   Chinese ministry.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:44.780]   Along the way, we also, this church saw the birth of a Mandarin-speaking community.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:50.340]   Now the very little Mandarin that we picked up when we were attending church in Singapore
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:58.500]   became useful and handy because we were able to reach out to others, especially those who
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.500]   are Mandarin-speaking.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:06.660]   So, in that sense, God prepared us, or this church, to reach out to others in interesting
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.580]   and creative ways.
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:17.260]   Of course, I'm also proud and had the privilege to serve with a wonderful bunch of elders
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.580]   in this church in the past nine years.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:29.700]   Going through firsthand the tremendous ups and downs for this church, we went through
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:38.060]   all the trials and triumphs together, including during the social movement period and the
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.900]   COVID restriction.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:46.780]   But we are thankful, thankful to you because you gave generously and faithfully through
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.020]   the difficult times.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:55.940]   And we are so encouraged because you make every single effort to come and worship and
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.340]   to gather in this place.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:07.460]   We can testify the great purpose of God, including his seeing us through the tremendous hurdles
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:12.700]   of setting up the Yuen Long Church Plant.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.620]   Now I'm not recounting all this as Christ in me.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:24.580]   It's not about me, but rather as an individual in this congregation.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:31.860]   I witnessed the hands of God moving amongst us, all of us.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:38.140]   And this is only a mini account of the many good things God is working in this church
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:44.460]   through the many of you seated here today to serve and love each other in your small
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:55.700]   groups, in your K4C classes, in the language ministries, in the prayer team, in alpha,
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:02.620]   in worship team, in your outreach efforts, in your smile when you meet someone in this
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:11.580]   congregation and in your hard work up front or behind the scenes.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:17.060]   There are people who begin to ask me how I would like to serve as I step down from the
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.380]   eldership board later this year.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.380]   Good question.
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.940]   Lots of wrestling.
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.740]   Well, but I believe the best is yet to be.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.500]   Well, no solid answer yet.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:36.860]   However, I will say on behalf of my fellow elders that they are committed to serve all
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:42.300]   of you diligently in days and years to come.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.700]   But actually each and every one of us should be asking these questions.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:54.780]   How we can best serve our God and how God wants His best for this church and how He
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:25:00.260]   wants to entrust each and every one of us here.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:08.700]   I do have a glimpse of the possible future for this church, that each congregant here
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:19.580]   is called into a community intimately rooted in His Word and in Him and ever ready to reach
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.780]   out to others.
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:31.180]   Well, after all, God's plan for us remains a mystery but will be revealed in the fulfillment
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.500]   of times.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:41.940]   Indeed, verse 10 says, "It would be put into effect when the times reached their fulfillment
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:50.220]   to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ."
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:56.820]   Note that Paul actually expands this use of language to a cosmic scale.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:06.740]   Everything, creation and redemption of the cosmos is to be in Christ, under Christ.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:14.380]   The word translated as "bring unity" is interesting, "grit rith anna kafalio."
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.900]   Kafali means the head.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:23.740]   Okay, so we have medical conditions like micro-cavillous, very small brain, with hydro-cavillous,
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   water-filled up brain.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.140]   But it's a different head we are talking about.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:34.780]   It's the majestic, royal head, Christ in the heavenlies.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:39.740]   So it is significant because it emphasizes on three things.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:44.380]   One, Christ is the head, the ruler.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:51.340]   Christ sums up or brings things to a coherent and meaningful whole.
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:59.380]   And number three, Christ restores harmony to a universe that was chaotic because of
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.300]   sin.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.140]   So what would be the implication?
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:10.100]   Now we have fellowship not only with God but also with one another.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:15.580]   Horizontally, Christ connects God and the church here.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:23.900]   Horizontally, Christ connects all of us, even those who come from diverse social economic
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.980]   backgrounds.
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:31.500]   Christ is ruling over us.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:37.140]   His fulfillment has begun through his life, death, and resurrection.
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:44.940]   He's already Lord of all times, just as redemption is both now, present, and future.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:52.940]   And yet the future has moved into the present and changes how we should live.
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:59.060]   I do understand sometimes we doubt because we do not see obvious actions from him.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:03.540]   And then we wrongly assume that God is not active.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:08.220]   Well God is not necessarily public in all his actions.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:14.740]   But surely God does reveal himself in his own time.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:20.080]   He's active in making his purposes in Christ known.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:26.580]   So we almost need a sign that reads, "Slow down, God is at work."
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.180]   "Slow down, God is at work."
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:39.140]   This should be comforting because Christ is supreme over everything in this world.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:47.340]   This could speak to our fears for the future or worries that we hold for the present.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:52.940]   It should help us freed from the oppression or the opposition that we are facing.
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:56.140]   We have Jesus who is head over everything.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.140]   Therefore we have peace in our present.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:06.540]   I really love the school motto of my son when he studied in Anglo-Chinese school in Singapore.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:13.260]   The motto is, "The best is yet to be."
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.860]   The best is yet to be.
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:23.660]   As my son-in-law and my daughter about to plan to move to the UK in just two weeks'
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:29.900]   time, well my encouragement for them is, "The best is yet to be."
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:36.100]   But they are to discover for themselves the bigger reality of God's grand plan in their
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.100]   life.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:46.540]   Likewise, young men, young women, and indeed everyone in this congregation, we are assured
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:51.700]   and promised that the best is yet to be.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.620]   However, for this church, planting a church in Yuen Long or growing in numbers here in
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:04.340]   Wan Chai are not by themselves the ultimate fulfillment of God's purposes for the vine.
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:13.180]   There is a bigger reality, but His grand plan for this church will continue to unfold.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:19.460]   So I paraphrase the whole prayer in this biblical text by Paul.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:24.820]   I would like to invite all of us to stand so that we may read this prayer together in
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.820]   a paraphrased manner.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:35.940]   So we shall see on the screen the prayer that I wrote, "How Marvelous God is."
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.220]   And let us read together.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:45.300]   His Spirit has provided everything needed for life and for the vine.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.940]   For every good thing has been made available in Christ.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.300]   We praise such a God.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:57.820]   Right from the first, God has been busy devising a way to draw us home to Himself so that we
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.780]   may live with Him and for Him.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.180]   Through Jesus Christ, He has made us family.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:11.820]   As a result, the vine prays God for the way He freely gave Himself to us in Christ.
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:16.740]   In Christ's death, God's abundant care for us is known.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.980]   God gave Himself for us to bring us back and make us His people.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.940]   What lavish love He has for us.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.220]   We honor you, God.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:34.600]   In His unfathomable wisdom, God has made known His plan and desire to bring all things together
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.600]   in Christ.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:41.140]   This includes everything in our world and everything in God's world.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:47.620]   Amazingly, God's plan includes the vine and gives us a share of what He is doing.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:53.380]   For this, the vine prays God for the hope that is ours in Christ.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:58.820]   When we heard about the truth from God and believe the good news about His plan, God
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:02.900]   marked us as His own by giving us His Spirit.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:09.060]   The Spirit dwelling in us is a pledge from God that He will complete His plan and that
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.820]   one day we will truly live with God.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:18.660]   For this, we, the vine, praise you, our God, we do worship you.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.540]   May I invite the band?
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.260]   And I want to challenge all of us while I give you this encouragement.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:31.820]   And in a short moment's time, you're most encouraged to join us in a prayer line as
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.980]   you commit yourself.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:45.200]   Number one, we all have a dual identity on earth and in heaven, which is the bigger reality.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:51.260]   You might be from local or you may be from a foreign land.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:58.260]   Dare to believe that you are here in Hong Kong in this season as part of God's grand
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:05.500]   plan for Hong Kong and you matter to Him.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:11.660]   You might be born and bred from the ministry of this church or you have moved in from other
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:17.420]   congregation to try to settle here in the vine.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:23.860]   Dare to believe that you are part of God's grand plan in this church.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.780]   You matter to us.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:37.300]   Last, allow His comforting presence to rest in you always as indeed He is in you.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   But also be mindful that He encompasses all that we are.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.580]   We are in Christ and under Christ.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:56.220]   Let Him take lead in your life and that His dream becomes your dream.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.660]   Be truly blessed by our blessed, worthy God.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.660]   Amen.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.660]   Amen.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:01.660]   Amen.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.080]   (soft music)
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.660]   (gentle music)
