1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 My name is Andrew. Welcome to everybody in this room.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 We're packed. I know people are standing.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 We do have a few seats available at the front here.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 So if you do need to come in, I know people are standing up at the back.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 We are at capacity. It's so great to have you guys with us.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Welcome to everybody online as well. We are so grateful that you are standing with us.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Wherever you are around Hong Kong and around the world in this moment,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 you're with us too. This is church together, both in this room and what you guys are doing,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 wherever it is that you are.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I pray that that worship experience for you is as deep as it was for us here.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I don't even know where to begin. I'm so...

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I'm in a green pasture. Can you notice our green pastures?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm wearing my green pasture shirt today. Is that alright?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 You like that? You like that?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 So about a year ago, almost to this very day, for the first time in my life,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I heard what I could only describe to you as the audible voice of God.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I was walking through the transit terminal of Doha International Airport.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I don't know if you've ever been to Doha International Airport.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 It's one of the biggest airports in the world.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 The transit lounge and the transit hall there is massive.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 And there are thousands of people that congregate into that place every day

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 that are passing through Doha on their way to anywhere in the world that you could imagine.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And I was there with an 11-hour layover.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 The Vine had booked my flight to Jordan the cheapest way possible, in the name of Jesus.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I had an 11-hour layover in Jordan. Praise God.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And as I'm at the beginning of my 11-hour layover,

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I'm walking through one of the busiest parts of Doha International Airport.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And as I'm walking down this corridor where thousands of other people are,

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 a Middle Eastern man walks right past me, almost brushes my shoulder.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 We were pretty hemmed in. And almost brushes my shoulder and walks past me.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And as he does, I hear the audible voice of God, "Follow him.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Follow him."

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 It's hard to describe it to you, but it sounded like Morgan Freeman.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 No, it didn't. It didn't sound like that.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I don't know really how it sounded, but it was the first time in my life

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 where I almost like, I was like, something like spoke to me,

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 or it was like this audible voice. And because it was so real,

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I immediately found myself following after the guy.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And I literally like turned around and started following after him.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Not really knowing why I was following after him,

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 but I knew that I had been commanded to change my direction and follow him.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 So I started walking about 10 feet behind him.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And after about like maybe 20 yards or so, I was like feeling really weird about it.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Like, what am I doing following this guy? Like, who is he?

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I have no idea who he is. I have no idea why God wants me to follow him,

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 but I'm following him. And then I'm thinking like,

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 does he know that I'm following him? Because that would be weird.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Right? Like this is the Middle East. Maybe I'm about to get arrested.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Like what happens when you follow random people?

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So I'm like following him and he kind of walks through this part of the airport

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 and then he goes into the side. Now at the side of the transit hall in Doha,

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 they have all these rooms and these rooms have like little lounge chairs in them

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 where people can go and sleep for a few hours.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And he walks into one of these rooms.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 There's probably about 30 or 40 of the chairs in the room

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 and he sits down on this chair. And I find myself walking into the room

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 and then very nonchalantly sort of, you're going to be him,

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 sort of sitting down right next to him like this, you know,

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 like kind of going like, why am I here? Right?

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 As I sit down, he leans forward and he starts to just weep.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 He starts to sob his eyes out.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Now I've spent enough time in the Middle East to understand the culture there

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 and that's unusual in that Middle Eastern culture.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 To be honest, it's unusual in the majority of cultures.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 But particularly in that culture where men, a public display of emotion like that

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 is not necessarily looked upon as a good thing.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 But he just leans forward, head in his hand, just weeping

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 and immediately pasta mode of Andrew takes over, right?

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And I've been in this scenario a number of times.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 This was a bit of a weird one, I admit, like following this guy.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 But I've been in this scenario a number of times.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 So I just kind of like, again, you're him and I'm me, right?

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 So you're sobbing. Go on, sob. No, no, sit, sit, sit.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Head in hand, cry, cry. Yeah, okay, good.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 So I'm there.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 You're never going to sit in the front row ever again, never.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Neither is anybody else. All right.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 So you're crying.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So I lean forward and I go like this.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I'm like, "Hey, I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do to help?"

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Thank you.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So he turns to me and he points at his mouth like this,

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 basically saying, "I don't speak English."

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So I kind of like smile and I point to my mouth,

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 basically saying, "I don't really speak English."

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 No, like, "I don't speak Arabic," is what I was trying to say to him.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 "I don't really speak Arabic." And he kind of nodded.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And he looked kind of embarrassed, as you can imagine, right?

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 But I was like, "I can't communicate to this man,

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 but I can be present with him."

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 So I kind of just sat there and I leaned towards him again

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 and I kind of put my hands like this in my lap,

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 like very pastoral, right?

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And I kind of like just smiled at him,

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 you know, like trying to communicate, "I'm here," right?

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Well, he kind of wipes his eyes,

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 and I think he's feeling a little embarrassed,

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 so he gets out his mobile phone and he flips through it

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 and he shows me what I assume was a picture of his family,

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 beautiful family, massive large family, beautiful family.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And so I like got my phone out, you know,

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 and scrolled and showed a picture of my dog.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 No, I showed my wife and daughter, don't worry.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 I showed a picture of my family as well,

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 and he had this face, like it was classic.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 He had this face like, "Wow, that's your family?

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Like, you did well."

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 He was like, "You managed that? Good job," right?

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So he was kind of looking at me like that,

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 and I was like smiling, "Family," you know.

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And then he kind of like put his phone away,

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 and then he stood up and he just walked away.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And that was it.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 That was the whole interaction.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I have no idea to this day who that man was.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 I have no idea what was going on in his life,

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 but I do know this.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I do know that God loved that man so much,

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 that God cared for that man so much

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 that he would disrupt my just normal day,

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 11-hour layover in Doha, trying to be just a tourist,

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 and change me into that pastor

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 who could then follow him in a moment

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 where his emotions were obviously just sort of built up inside of him,

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 and those emotions just suddenly come out,

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 and I can sit there with him,

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 and I realized what was taking place.

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Even though I could not communicate to him,

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 here's what was happening.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 I was a non-anxious presence amid the chaos of this man's world.

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Just in that moment of time,

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 a non-anxious presence in his life.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 You need to know that God desires to take you

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 in and out of places of rest

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 so that you would then become a place of rest for others.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 That's what this series is all about.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 It's what actually Psalm 23 is all about.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 As I said last week, it's not just a psalm

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 to make us feel good about ourselves,

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 to chill out with God,

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 a psalm for us to feel like we can relax.

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 The psalm is actually to create in us a place of rest,

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 a place of life, a place of restoration with God

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 so that we can then be that to others in this world

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 who are freaked out, who can't handle it,

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 and we are there with them in the midst of their chaos,

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 communicating something of the peace,

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 the shalom, the restoration that God has given us.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And God's heart for you is to lead you

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 in and out of those places of rest

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 so you would be the embodied rest of God for others.

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Are you with me, church?

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 It's this idea of God leading his people into rest

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 that David shifts to after his opening verse.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 His opening verse of Psalm 23, "The Lord is my shepherd.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I shall not be in want."

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And then he immediately starts talking about leadership,

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 about how a shepherd leads his people.

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Let me read this to you in verses two and three.

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 "He makes me lie down in green pastures.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 He leads me beside quiet waters.

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 He restores my soul.

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 He guides me in paths of righteousness

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 or right paths for his name's sake."

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Just a short couple of verses, but this is David at his best.

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 This is David writing a psalm.

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Remember, psalms were poems.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 He's writing a poem like a song.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And in his writing, he's trying to express

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 some beautiful imagery to help us to understand

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 the rest and the peace that God provides,

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 not only for ourselves, but for all of his creation.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And he's also trying to teach some deep theological truths

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 through this poetic imagery.

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Now, if you are to read this in the Hebrew,

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 you actually get a much better sense of the poetic form

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 and structure that David's trying to create.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 In fact, his whole argument in these two verses

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 is based around a specific poetic structure.

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 In the Hebrew, he basically goes, "Here's an action of God.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Here's a place that God takes us to, and here's the result."

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Let me actually show you this structure here.

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 This is the structure of Psalm 23, verses two and three.

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Here's a few things I want you to see.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 First of all, I want you to see the right-hand column,

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 the result.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 This is what God is doing in you.

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 This is what David is trying to communicate to his people

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 as he writes this, that God's desire is to bring you

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 into a place of rest, a place of peace,

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 the shalom of God in you, that would bring restoration,

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 change and transform you so that you're not like you were before,

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 but you're now a new person, a new human being

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 with a level of deep rest and peace that you've never had before.

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Why? So that God has glory on the earth,

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 so that God gets glory.

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 He doesn't want you just to be at rest so that you can enjoy yourself.

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 This is not about being on Bali with a pina colada.

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 This is about you becoming the person Christ wants you to be

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 in the craziness of the world around you.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 This is you being a restful presence for God's glory.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 David's saying that's what God wants.

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 That's what he's constantly trying to bring into our lives.

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 How does he do it?

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 First of all, he has to bring us into certain experiences

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 that will create in us the result of the rest and peace.

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Are you following this?

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 So there are places that he takes us to.

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Now, David metaphorically, poetically describes these places

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 as green pastures, quiet waters, right paths.

211
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And what he's saying is if you do not go through these places,

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 you will not experience the rest that God wants you to have.

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Are you following the argument?

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 So in order to go into those places, he then says at the start,

215
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 there is an action.

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 There's something God does to bring us into those places

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 to create the rest.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 He makes us, leads us, and guides us to certain experiences

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 so those experiences transform us and create the result,

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 the fruit of rest and peace that is seen publicly

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 so God gets the glory.

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Are you following this?

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 This is David's heart for this part of the psalm.

224
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 If I was to say it simply, this is what David's saying.

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 If you truly want to experience and know his rest,

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 then you need to allow yourself to experience the one thing

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 that God desires to do the most in you, and that is lead you.

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Lead you.

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 If you truly want to know rest, you have to be willing to allow God

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 to lead you, lead you into places that will do its work in you

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 to create that rest.

232
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And this is a challenge because David's saying,

233
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 "There's a prerogative here, and the prerogative is God's leadership

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 of your life."

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 You remember last week when we looked at the opening of the psalm

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 where we said, "The Lord is my shepherd.

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 I shall not be in want," and we said we can flip that around

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 and say it in reverse.

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 In other words, we can say, "I have wants.

240
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Therefore, the Lord is not quite my shepherd."

241
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Well, in the same way, you can flip this around as well.

242
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And really what David's saying is this.

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 If you do not feel rest, if there is some anxiety in you,

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 if you're not in a place of rest, then there's elements in your life

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 that are not submitted to the leadership of God.

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Are you following me?

247
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Now, this is what he's trying to lay out to us,

248
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 and this is a great challenge because if you're anything like me,

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 we struggle at times to really allow God to lead us.

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Maybe it's just me here, but I think many of us struggle to know

251
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 what it is to really be led by God, and there are maybe some areas

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 of our lives that we think are being led by God,

253
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 and there are other areas of our lives that we know we are not

254
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 definitely being led by God, and then there are some areas

255
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 of our lives where we do not want God to lead us.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 And we're always in this structure of, I think, struggling to really,

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 truly give ourselves over to be led by God.

258
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 I want to offer today some reasons why I think that's the case.

259
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I want to say this.

260
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I think part of the reason why you struggle to allow God

261
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 to fully lead your life is because you actually have a faulty perception

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 of what it means for God to lead your life.

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Let me unpack that by saying this.

264
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I think for many of us, the model that we work of when we think about God

265
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 leading our lives is kind of like the woman that is in Google Maps.

266
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 We think God is like that woman with the really nice English accent

267
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 or the really nice American accent, and we put in a destination

268
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 into Google Maps, and the woman shows up and says, "Turn left,"

269
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 gives us a suggestion, and we think, "Oh, well, if we go there,

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 then we're going to go in this right direction where we want to go."

271
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And we've kind of made God the GPS of our lives.

272
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 We kind of think God's role in our lives is to come along

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 and offer some suggestions for us in order that we might go

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 on the right kind of path.

275
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 So we think that God is involved in our lives, and He's like,

276
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 "Oh, turn left here. Oh, no, you didn't turn left. You turned right.

277
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Don't worry. That's okay. Re-rooting.

278
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 We're going to get you back on the right path.

279
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Don't worry. It's perfectly fine.

280
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Oh, no, you went left again. It's all right. Don't worry.

281
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Going to turn you right here. No, you didn't go right again."

282
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And we think God's role in our lives to be led by Him is like

283
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 we can just kind of expect He's going to be--

284
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Let me put it as bluntly as I can.

285
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 You need to stop thinking that God is the GPS of your life.

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 You need to stop thinking that. That's not the way God leads us.

287
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 God doesn't lead us that way.

288
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 When you use a GPS, you put in your destination, you push start,

289
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 you hope that a nice straight path comes, and if you get off that path,

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 you'll just be nudged back onto the right path.

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 God is not interested in you coming up with what you think

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 are the right destinations in life.

293
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 He's not interested in you typing in what you think is the right place to go.

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 He doesn't even think that you know where the green pastures are for your life.

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 He knows.

296
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And so He's not there just to kind of help you get where you want to go in your life.

297
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 No, you don't have a GPS. You have a shepherd.

298
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 It's a very different way of leading.

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 It's not a nudging. It's a direct leading.

300
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And the Bible's very clear to us.

301
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 When we think about God like a GPS, when we think we actually know the right way to go,

302
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 essentially we haven't let God lead in our lives.

303
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 We're still leading our lives, and we're asking God to coach us along the way.

304
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I won't ask you to put your hand up if that's how you think about your relationship with God,

305
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 because I know I do sometimes like that.

306
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 The Bible's very clear.

307
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 We actually don't know the way.

308
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I'm just going to burst some bubbles here.

309
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 You don't know the way.

310
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 You don't know the best way for your life.

311
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And sure, God's given you a brain, He's given you gifts, and He's given you talents,

312
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 He's given you the ability to discern.

313
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 We partner with God in many ways.

314
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 But ultimately, you don't know where the green pastures are

315
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 that He wants to lead you to, so that you would know the rest in order to be able to give Him glory.

316
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 That's His job.

317
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 In fact, Proverbs is very blunt with this.

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Let me go to Proverbs chapter 14.

319
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 I just want to read one proverb here.

320
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 It says this.

321
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 It says, "There is a way that seems right to Andrew, but in the end it leads to death.

322
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Or submit your name.

323
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 There is a way that seems right to us,

324
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 but actually ultimately it just leads us to a place of hurt, a place of pain, a place of death.

325
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 One of an ex-shepherd, he was a shepherd for many years,

326
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 and then he wrote a book about shepherding in Psalm 23.

327
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Amazing book. His name is Philip Keller.

328
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 He wrote about this in this way.

329
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Let me read this to you.

330
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 "There is something almost terrifying about the destructive self-determination of a human being.

331
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 It is inextricably interlocked with personal pride and self-assertion.

332
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 We insist we know what is the best way for us,

333
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 even though disastrous results may be self-evident.

334
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 We think we know the way to go,

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 but actually even though we know that that's not going to work out good,

336
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 we keep pressing into that because there's something quite painful and dark

337
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 about our own pride and our own belief about our self-sufficiency."

338
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And he's saying this is not the way to go.

339
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 You need to realize that God is not interested in making suggestions about the direction of your life.

340
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 He wants to lead your life.

341
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 This is why when David starts to write these two verses about leadership,

342
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 he starts like this. Let me read this to you.

343
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 "He makes me lie down in green pastures."

344
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I don't know about you, but that doesn't seem like the right kind of language

345
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 when we come to think about God's leadership in our lives, right?

346
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 I don't know about you, but I'm uncomfortable with being made to do anything.

347
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Like, do not make me do anything, right?

348
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 The last couple of years during COVID, it's like the whole world has been like,

349
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 "Do not tell me what to do," right?

350
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 "You cannot make me do anything. I will do what I want to do."

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Okay, I'm in lockdown again. All right.

352
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 But I'm going to rebel against it.

353
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 We don't like, there's a human nature in us. We don't like to be made.

354
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And so when David starts and he says, "God makes me lie down,"

355
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 there's something in us that kind of rebels against that straight away.

356
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And we're kind of like, "What is God saying here?

357
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 I would rather this read, 'Oh, he suggests. Oh, he offers some ideas.

358
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Oh, he kind of goes, 'Maybe over here. Give it a go.'"

359
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 That's what we want to hear.

360
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 David goes, "You know what God's like?

361
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 God's not just making suggestions. He's actually giving directions.

362
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 God's not just trying to offer you some advice.

363
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 He's actually telling you what to do.

364
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Follow Him."

365
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Oh, okay.

366
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 There's something about the power of that that we need to grasp.

367
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 See, here's the reality.

368
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Shepherds know that sheep never lie down in fields.

369
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Very rarely do they lie down.

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 When was the last time you drove past a field of sheep and they were lying down?

371
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Right? Sheep don't do that.

372
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 They're up on their feet all the time. Why?

373
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Because they're flighty animals. They're afraid all the time.

374
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And shepherds will tell you that sheep need actually four things to be right in their lives

375
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 in order for them to lie down. Four things.

376
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 The first thing is they need to be well-fed.

377
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 If they're hungry, they won't lie down.

378
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Number two, they need to be free from fear.

379
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So if there's any danger around them, they're not going to lie down.

380
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Number three, because they're social animals,

381
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 they need to make sure everything is right with the flock.

382
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 If anybody's got any friction in the flock, they won't lie down.

383
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And fourthly, if there are any bugs or flies on them or around them, they will not lie down.

384
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 These are very temperamental animals. Okay?

385
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 So when David says, "He makes me lie down in green pastures,"

386
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 what he's picturing here is an image of sheep already in green pastures.

387
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Already there, but they're refusing to lie down.

388
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 They're in green pastures, but they're refusing to lie down

389
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 because maybe one of those four things is not right in their lives.

390
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Who of you in this room knows that you can be in one of the most relaxed places in the world?

391
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 You could be in a spa, but if you're having an argument with your spouse, you are not relaxed.

392
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Anyone else here? Again, just me. All right.

393
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 I can't tell you the number of holidays I've had,

394
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 or I've been in some incredible beach resort, some of the most beautiful places,

395
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 and just because somebody cut in front of me in the line of the buffet at breakfast,

396
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 I cannot relax, right? Are you with me?

397
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 What is it? We can be in what we think is a green pasture,

398
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 but we are refusing to lie down because there's stress in us.

399
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 There's stuff going on in us. We're still overwhelmed.

400
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 We don't know how to handle life, and there's things taking place.

401
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And so we might actually be in a place that is designed to give us rest,

402
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 but we're not lying down.

403
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And so David says, "He makes me lie down because he knows what's best for me.

404
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 He knows the places I need to be, and he knows that I need to receive in that place.

405
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 But if I'm constantly flighty, if I'm constantly looking up and looking around,

406
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 if I'm not being willing to submit myself to the environment that I'm in,

407
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 to recognize that I'm actually in a green pasture,

408
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 I won't lie down, and God will come, and he makes me.

409
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Maybe not by forcing me, because we know that God gives us choices,

410
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 but by letting us know that if we don't lie down,

411
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 we're going to miss out on the very thing that's going to set us free.

412
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 He brings us into places that are actually green pastures,

413
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 but we refuse to lie down.

414
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Some of you here today, you're actually in a green pasture,

415
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 but you are refusing to lie down.

416
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 As I was preparing this, I felt strongly that for some of us in this room,

417
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 that's Hong Kong for you.

418
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Hong Kong is God's green pasture, and you're here right now,

419
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 and you're refusing to lie down.

420
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Because of all the things that have happened, I get it.

421
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Because of all the stuff that has gone on, because of all the things,

422
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 and you've had lots of friends leave, and you're not sure,

423
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 "Should I stay? Should I go?"

424
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 That constant fight or flight, that constant sense of being overwhelmed,

425
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 that constant sense of, "Is this really the city that I thought it was?"

426
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And all that's still in your head, and yet you're living here,

427
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 you're here right now, God is working in this city,

428
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 he's actually placed you in Hong Kong,

429
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 it's a gift to you that Hong Kong could be the very green pasture,

430
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 but with all the flightiness in your mind right now,

431
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 you're refusing to actually be in the very place that's designed to give you rest.

432
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 I mean, imagine that.

433
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Hong Kong could give you rest.

434
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Most of us need to flee out of Hong Kong to get rest.

435
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Imagine what it would be like to realize that actually,

436
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I was designed to be here right now.

437
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And that actually, if I just allowed him to do what he wants to do,

438
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 even in the midst of me feeling the way I feel,

439
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 I could still know rest.

440
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Some of you, Hong Kong is the very green pasture you know,

441
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 but you are not receiving it.

442
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I want to challenge you to let go.

443
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 How do we let go?

444
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Well, notice what it says here.

445
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 He says this, "He leads me beside quiet waters.

446
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 He guides me in paths of righteousness."

447
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 The language of leadership here is a Hebrew word.

448
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 It's the word "nahal."

449
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And "nahal" literally means this,

450
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 "to walk out in front or to take the lead."

451
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 To walk out in front or to actually take the lead.

452
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Nahaling is the idea of how a shepherd leads his sheep.

453
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Shepherds do not get behind the sheep and try to push them forward,

454
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 drive them forward like you might want to drive cattle.

455
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 If you try to do that with sheep, the sheep just go all over the place, right?

456
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Likewise, a shepherd doesn't come up alongside of the sheep and go,

457
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 "Hey, do you feel like walking forward today?

458
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Hey, can I help you? Please turn left. Don't turn right."

459
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Here's how a shepherd leads his sheep.

460
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 He actually stands in front of the sheep.

461
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 He makes a call out to the sheep,

462
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 like we saw in the video last week with Abdallah making that call.

463
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 And then he starts to walk forward,

464
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 and the sheep come and follow him.

465
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 It's a very simple image.

466
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 God leads and we follow.

467
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 That's not GPS.

468
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 That's not expecting God to give us some guidance in life.

469
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 That's God actually being our guide.

470
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 That's actually submitting ourselves to the reality that He knows more than us,

471
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 that He has a destination better than us,

472
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 that if He wants to bring rest and peace in our lives

473
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 so that we can be a non-anxious presence in the world,

474
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 then we need to be led by Him to places that He wants us to be in,

475
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 so that we can be in that place of rest.

476
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 That's us saying, "Okay, you've got it. Not me. I'm following you."

477
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 That's us submitting ourselves to the leadership of God.

478
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 It is not a suggestion. It is a direction.

479
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Are you with me? Come on, church. Wake up.

480
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 This is not a suggestion.

481
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 It's the way God leads.

482
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Throughout the whole of Scripture, God leads this way.

483
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 One of the most important times that God needed to lead His people was the Exodus narrative,

484
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 when He's taking people out of Israel, out of Egypt, into the Promised Land,

485
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 out of a place that no longer was to feed them to a new green pasture.

486
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 How does He lead them? Through the desert?

487
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Scripture tells us, "A pillar of cloud at day and a pillar of fire at night."

488
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And guess what happened?

489
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 When the pillar of cloud or fire moved,

490
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Israel packed up their camp and moved with it.

491
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 When it stopped moving, they put down their camp,

492
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 and they waited there until it moved again.

493
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 It was a situation of Nahal.

494
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 It would go before them, they would follow.

495
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 It would stop, they would stop.

496
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 It would go, they would go.

497
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 If it stopped, they would stop.

498
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 That's how they got for 40 years through the desert into their Promised Land,

499
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 because they learned to be obedient to the movement and the leadership of God in their lives.

500
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 There is no scripture where the pillar of fire stops and comes down to Israel and says,

501
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 "How are you feeling today? Do you feel like going forward today?

502
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Maybe I can make some suggestions for you."

503
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 It's, "I lead, you follow."

504
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Jesus, He says to His disciples, "I'm the Good Shepherd.

505
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 If you know my voice, you will follow me."

506
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 He goes up to Matthew, who's a tax collector for many years,

507
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 and he says, "Matthew, follow me." And Matthew doesn't go, "Meh, I'm not sure I really quite want to do that."

508
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Matthew leaves everything and follows Him.

509
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 He says to Peter, "I'll make you a fisher of men. Just come and follow me."

510
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 And Peter leaves his whole livelihood behind and follows Him.

511
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 And we want a GPS when God just wants to lead, and He wants us to follow.

512
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 He wants us to give our lives to Him so that He can take us to the very places that He longs to take us to.

513
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 This is the beautiful image. God leads like this.

514
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 He goes before us, He prepares a path for us, and then He calls us to follow Him.

515
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 And He knows the places that He wants you to go to way better than you could know.

516
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And that's the beauty of following Him,

517
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 that we get the joy of discovering the places He wants to take us to.

518
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Some of you in this room and online, you're happy for God to give you guidance,

519
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 but you don't actually want God to be your guide.

520
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 There's a difference between getting guidance and having someone who's actually your guide.

521
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 And some of you need to actually turn back to Him today and go,

522
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 "I've been treating you as an advice agent. I've been treating you like my life coach."

523
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Life coaches are not necessarily designed to tell you exactly what to do.

524
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 They're just there to offer suggestions and advice to help you to be better.

525
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 God's not your life coach. He's your shepherd, and He's leading you.

526
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 And the question He's asking you is, "Are you going to follow Him? Are you following Me?"

527
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Because if you follow Me, guess what I'm going to do?

528
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 I'm going to take you to places that will be unlike anything you've ever experienced.

529
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 David describes these places, get this, as green pastures, quiet waters, and right paths.

530
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 If you allow yourself to be led by God, He's not going to take you into places that are not safe.

531
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 He's not going to take you into places that are there to harm you.

532
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 He's taking you into places of what he describes as green pastures, quiet waters, right paths.

533
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 And this is a wonderful thought.

534
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Some of us want the rest of God, but we don't want to be led to the places that will actually give us that rest.

535
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 When David talks about green pastures, quiet waters, right paths here,

536
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 anybody who read this in Israel, who was in the desert,

537
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 remember he's writing this in the Judean wilderness,

538
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 they would know that there's no such thing as green pastures or quiet waters in that place.

539
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 In fact, what is David talking about when he's saying God's going to lead us there like a shepherd?

540
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Because in any desert that these shepherds had ever been in, there wasn't this flourishing thing.

541
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 This is why we've done this here today,

542
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 because it's an ironic picture of what actually David is trying to do in the psalm.

543
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 The green pastures and quiet waters are not in the Judean wilderness.

544
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 They do not exist.

545
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 And what David is doing is he's subverting that imagery.

546
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 And he's saying, "You think green pastures look like this,

547
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 but actually the green pasture you're in right now looks like the Judean wilderness."

548
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 That in other words, God can take any circumstance, any situation, any place,

549
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 and he can turn what we might think as a desert into his flourishing green pasture.

550
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And sometimes we think we know what we need for rest.

551
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 "Oh, if I just do this, then I'm going to be rested, and I'm going to be able to flourish in life."

552
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 And God's saying, "You need to recognize that the green pastures I bring you into

553
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 oftentimes don't look like the green pastures you think they're going to look like."

554
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Some of you are in a really hard time right now.

555
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 You're in a desert experience is how you would describe it.

556
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And God looks down and says, "That's my green pasture for you right now,

557
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 that you can actually find me in the midst of what it is that you're going through right now.

558
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 That this bit, this place that I've actually led you into

559
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 is the very thing that's going to turn your life around.

560
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 This moment and this experience, as hard as it is right now,

561
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 is going to teach you the things that you need to know

562
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 so that you can be a non-anxious presence before a tired and broken world.

563
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 I've got you in a green pasture.

564
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Stop trying to fight the place that I've got you in

565
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 and recognize that your role is to lie down."

566
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And then He says this.

567
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 He says, "When you do that, you will have a restoration of your soul."

568
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 He says, "This restores your soul."

569
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 The word "restore soul" there in Hebrew means to be brought back.

570
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 He's saying, "This will bring you back."

571
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 What does it bring you back to?

572
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 It brings you right back to the way you were created to be in the first place.

573
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 It brings you right back to the person that God wants you to be.

574
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 It's the Genesis 1 and 2 invitation.

575
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Adam and Eve, naked and unashamed.

576
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Adam and Eve in the quietness of the night, walking with the presence of God.

577
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Adam and Eve with nothing broken in them.

578
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Between their relationship with God, their relationship with themselves,

579
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 their relationship with others, their relationship with creation.

580
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Everything just as God intended it to be, created in a way that was to bring rest and shalom.

581
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 The beautiful picture of Genesis 1 and 2.

582
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 And what God's saying here through David, "I restore your soul."

583
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Is He saying, "I will bring you back to that place of your fullness and rest."

584
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 That the imagery here is of a shepherd picking up a stray sheep that's wandered from the flock,

585
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 putting it on his shoulders and walking it back into the flock,

586
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 putting it back down so that sheep now can follow with the rest of the animals.

587
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 This is the picture.

588
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 All of us have wandered from the right path.

589
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 And the beautiful thing is when we submit our lives to Christ again,

590
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 when we allow Him to truly lead us,

591
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 He picks us up, puts us on His shoulder, takes us back into that right path,

592
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 and He says, "Follow me. Follow me.

593
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And I'm going to bring you into the places that will flourish you.

594
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 I will restore your soul, bring you back to the way that you were always created to be."

595
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Some of you in this room, you're struggling so much

596
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 because you know right now you're not the way you should be.

597
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Hear the Word of God to you today.

598
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 If He's your shepherd and you allow yourself to be led by Him,

599
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 He will pick you up on His shoulders and He will bring you back.

600
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 And this is all so that His namesake would be understood.

601
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 His glory would be seen.

602
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Jesus said it this way.

603
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 He said, "All you who are tired and weary and burdened,

604
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 just ask for My guidance and shepherding.

605
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Just ask for suggestion."

606
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Now He said, "For all of you who are weary and burdened,

607
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 I will come to you and give you rest."

608
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 No, He didn't say that.

609
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 He said, "If you're weary and burdened, come to Me and I will give you rest."

610
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Hi! How are you?

611
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 You're coming to Me?

612
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 I'm not Jesus.

613
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 But you know what?

614
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 That's a great example that we go to people.

615
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 We go to Jesus.

616
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 High five!

617
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 All right!

618
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 There you go.

619
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Allow yourself to go to Jesus.

620
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Follow Him.

621
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Be led by Him.

622
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And you will find Him bringing you back and restoring your soul.

623
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Would you stand with me?

624
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 I want to pray for you.

625
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 And let's pray.

626
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Father, we are so grateful for you.

627
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 So grateful for the way you lead us.

628
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 And Father, we recognize that some of us in this room are in green pastures,

629
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 but have refused to lie down.

630
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Father, would you come right now for anyone online and in this room

631
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 who they recognize that that's their response today.

632
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Some of you are fighting Hong Kong in your heart.

633
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 And yeah, Hong Kong may not be a perfect place.

634
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And we all know there are challenges here in this city.

635
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 But I want you to know that you are here.

636
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 That for all its ups and downs, God has planted you here.

637
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 And He sees this place as your green pasture.

638
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Some of you need to commit again to lying down here in our city.

639
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 And perhaps for some of you that will take some repentance today to say,

640
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 "God, I'm sorry that I've spoken so poorly of the very place that you've led me to.

641
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 And I need to submit myself again to your leadership."

642
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And if that means staying here, then I know that this will be the right place,

643
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 the green pasture for me to know true rest,

644
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 to be that non-anxious presence in a chaotic world for someone else

645
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 at a later date in some other time.

646
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Lord, would you show me what it is that you have for me here in this place?

647
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Some of you, that's your prayer today.

648
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 For others of you here, you know that you've been using God

649
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 to get you to the destination you want to go to.

650
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 You've been using God as a GPS in your life.

651
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 I pray that if that's you, you'll hear the Holy Spirit's gentle but firm voice to you today.

652
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Just say, "Let me lead you.

653
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 I and only I know the destination that's best for you.

654
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 I know where those quiet waters are.

655
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 I know what that green pasture looks like for you so that you can receive that rest.

656
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Let go," God says to you today.

657
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 "Let go of your ability to lead yourself.

658
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Let go of your self-reliance that ultimately will only lead to your exhaustion.

659
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 And allow me to lead you again.

660
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 I'm a good shepherd," Jesus says.

661
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 "I will take you.

662
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 I will pick you up and bring you back."

663
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Some of you, that's a word for you as well.

664
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Perhaps you've strayed from your relationship with God.

665
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Maybe during COVID it was tough.

666
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Maybe being out of the church.

667
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 Maybe it was difficult for you to maintain a spiritual vibrancy in your life.

668
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 I totally understand that.

669
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 It's been a difficult few years.

670
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 I pray that you would hear the word, the voice of God saying to you today,

671
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 "I will restore your soul.

672
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 I will bring you back to green pastures, quiet waters."

673
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And they may not look like what you think they're going to look like.

674
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 It's not for you to define the green pastures.

675
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 I'm going to say that again.

676
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Some of you need to hear this.

677
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 It's not for you to define what the green pastures are going to look like for you.

678
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 That's the Lord's sovereignty over your life.

679
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 He actually knows better than you do exactly the experiences you need to have

680
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 in order for you to find rest.

681
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Some of you need to let go of your vision of a green pasture.

682
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 And I'll just allow God to lead you.

683
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 Holy Spirit, we pray that you would do this in us and through us.

684
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 That it would be for your namesake.

685
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Not for us, not for the vine, for yours.

686
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 That your glory would be seen because we become a non-anxious presence

687
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 in the chaos of this world.

688
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Lead us, Lord.

689
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 Lead us, Lord.

690
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Lead us, Lord.

691
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Lead us.

692
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 May you hear the Holy Spirit say to you today, "Follow me."

693
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
