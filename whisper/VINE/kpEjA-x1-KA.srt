1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
 Obedient to the glory of God that is seen in this moment and the glory of God that that envelops our city

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,940
 And the glory of God that is found in this world and we pray this in Jesus name

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,200
 everyone says

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,800
 Have a seat have a seat

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,640
 so so last year

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,240
 About probably I would say about halfway through

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,720
 The eight hundred and fifty kilometer walk that I was doing through the north of Spain during my sabbatical the Camino de Santiago

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,320
 Literally about halfway through that walk

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,760
 my phone died

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,420
 This actual phone this very very phone died on me and when I say died

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,140
 I'm not just saying like the battery ran out and like it lost reception or something

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,760
 I mean like total death without resurrection

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,560
 My phone went to hell

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,520
 It is totally and totally gone. I got the black screen of death never to revive itself

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,040
 I mean I tried everything I could to get it to come back to life

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,400
 But it was completely and utterly dead now that was an issue for many reasons

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,180
 It was an issue because this was how I was connecting with my wife and my daughter every day

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,240
 I was gonna be away for about five weeks as I did the Camino and

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,100
 This was my ability to stay in touch with my family

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,160
 I was off social media at the time, but this was my ability to stay in touch with the world

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,480
 So through the news and at night when I would watch YouTube

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,000
 Very important

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 this was the

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,160
 Connection point for my journaling and anytime God spoke to me. I would use my phone and write it down

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,880
 It was I was writing a book. I'm still writing a book. I've been writing a book for ten years

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,160
 I was still writing my book on this and every night on the Camino

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,240
 I would try to write a couple of paragraphs of my book all on my phone

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
 So when it died, that was a big issue

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,860
 But the biggest issue was that I was using this phone every single day and pretty much almost all day

30
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,380
 To navigate the route that I needed to take on the Camino itself

31
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,340
 So every single day I would use this as the map and all of us who are pilgrims on the Camino

32
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,240
 This is what we had. We didn't have a paper map. We had our phones and in these days, you know, there's a

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,360
 Specific Google map that you can download that has the Camino trail on it

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,420
 It has all the villages you're gonna go through it has all the hostels that you can stay at and there's literally like a blue dot

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,840
 Where you are on the Camino every time and so it's impossible to get lost

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,120
 You just open up the map on your phone. You follow the blue dot you follow the line that you're on and you're great

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,280
 They have occasionally

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,080
 Yellow markings yellow arrows painted on the side of buildings and stuff just in case but they are kind of few and far between

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,600
 You've got this map on your phone and that's what helps you. So here I am in the middle of this day

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:06,560
 I'm in the middle of nowhere in Spain. I don't speak the language. I'm struggling to understand the culture and

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,680
 No one is around me

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,060
 But all I have is my trusty phone and the map and I know I'm on the right path and as I'm walking that day

43
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,240
 it dies and

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,360
 It goes it like immediately gone

45
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,400
 Now here was the thing. I was kind of freaking out about I was like, oh my goodness

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,760
 What am I gonna do because like I can't navigate now, there's no one around me

47
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
 I was in the middle of nowhere

48
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,960
 There was no village that I could see sometimes the villages were like our little kind of stop point where you kind of know that

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,520
 If you get to that village, you're on the right path. Well, there's no village. There's no map. There's no nothing. There's no pilgrims. I

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,200
 Remember thinking okay. Well, I did look ahead a little bit and I know I had to turn right and I know there was a

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,440
 Bit around to the left and so I'm like, well, I'll just try to use my memory a little bit

52
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,720
 Maybe things will be okay

53
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,080
 So I start walking and and start trusting in my memory after I've made like two right turns and a left turn and another right

54
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,980
 Turn I realized that my memory has finished I can memorize a sermon word for word, but I cannot memorize a map

55
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:16,320
 So my memory completely failed and I had I had no memory now of where I needed to go still no one else around me

56
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,560
 And so I began to pray because that's what you're gonna do and I began to say Jesus

57
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,240
 Oh Jesus, if you could just help me here, I'm in the middle of nowhere. I don't know where to go

58
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,600
 I don't know where the next village is. I don't know

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,040
 I'm just gonna have to trust you Lord

60
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,560
 And I started to pray and I started to pray and I started to walk and pray walk and pray

61
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,740
 I'm like God if I'm not supposed to go right shut the door

62
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,720
 And I would go right but the door would still be open and I'd keep going right

63
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,600
 After about an hour. I've not come up to any village. I've not seen any other pilgrims

64
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,920
 But I'm trusting in the Jesus and the Holy Spirit

65
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,280
 So I walk another half hour an hour and a half no village

66
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,200
 No pilgrims my trust of Jesus is beginning to waver a little bit at this point

67
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,000
 I'm beginning to wonder whether I am actually on the right path. It feels like I'm

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,860
 Horrendously lost and suddenly I have this thought I wonder if anyone else has felt this way

69
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,280
 When you're in a situation where you've been trying on your own and it seems like all the doors are shut

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,240
 I had this thought maybe I should go back

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,320
 Maybe if I just turn around and go back to where I started

72
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,320
 If I walk a hour and a half back in the other direction and try to retrace my steps as much as possible

73
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,840
 I will be at the place where my phone died because at least then I knew I was on the path

74
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,680
 So I'm literally I have walked for an hour and a half. I'm decided. Yes. I'm gonna turn around

75
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,520
 I turn around and start walking back where I had come as soon as I start walking back from where I'd come

76
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
 I noticed on the horizon

77
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,560
 somebody with a backpack

78
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,180
 Another pilgrim two thoughts went straight through my head number one. Maybe their phone has died too

79
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,400
 and

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
 Maybe they're lost as well

81
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:10,160
 Or maybe their phones working and they're on the path and I'm not lost after all and so I'm starting to walk really fast

82
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,800
 I'm almost like running towards them there. It was this German lady that hadn't met her before

83
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,120
 She's kind of wondering why this pilgrim is running at her as I get kind of close to her

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,400
 She goes, why are you going in the wrong direction?

85
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,360
 And I'm like because my phone's broken and I got my phone out. I'm like look it's dead

86
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,840
 And she then pulls her phone out which is working and she goes. Well, we're actually on the right path

87
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,040
 She's like you're fine. Everything's gonna be fine

88
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,480
 In fact, and she just showed me like up just up over there a little bit left to the right up over that hill over there

89
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,240
 There's the village that you want to come to and when you get to that village

90
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,040
 There'll be some food and some water and I was like, oh, thank you Lord Jesus

91
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,480
 for this German lady and

92
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,880
 For the reality that I know that I'm now on the right path

93
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,860
 Well, I get to the village and I put my backpack down and I have a really nice lunch and I'm feeling a lot more

94
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,880
 Healthy and a lot more kind of sane and I get map from the lady

95
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,400
 She was gonna go off and walk on her own

96
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
 but she gave me a

97
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,680
 Written down kind of map of where I needed to go and I had it on a piece of paper and I felt confident again

98
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,480
 And I managed to get to the village

99
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,280
 eventually where I was gonna stay that night and I managed to unpack my my backpack and have a shower at the hostel I was

100
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,360
 Staying in then straight after that. I began to just sit and as soon as I sat, you know

101
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
 You know, like sometimes you've got like so much activity going in your life that God can't speak to you

102
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,440
 Anyone else been like is it just me? Maybe it's just me. Sometimes we're like so busy, right?

103
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,200
 We're still doing stuff and it's only when we finally sit down that God's like great now

104
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,720
 I can speak and I kind of sat down and God began to speak

105
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,240
 And God began to speak to me in a very strong way in a very it was a very kind of Holy Spirit

106
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,120
 And I knew kind of like he was beginning to say some pretty serious things and I went to my pocket to get my phone

107
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,360
 Out so I could journal what he was saying and realize of course my phone's dead

108
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,160
 So so I grabbed a piece of paper and I began to write down what he said

109
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,240
 In fact, I grabbed this piece of paper right here

110
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
 this is the

111
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,320
 Very piece of paper that I I had and and before I show you what what I wrote you might remember

112
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,760
 During my sabbatical I had gone into my sabbatical asking God to speak to me about

113
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,360
 You know the vine and about us and our future and what God wants to do and what God wants to do me in the future

114
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,600
 And all that and God hadn't spoken to me at all throughout my whole sabbatical. That's all about the vine effect

115
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,120
 He'd spoken to me about all these other things which were for him much more important for me in that moment of my life

116
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,400
 But in this moment as soon as I sat down as he started to speak and the Holy Spirit came on me

117
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,480
 I knew he was speaking to me about us about the vine and

118
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,080
 It's the only time on the whole of my sabbatical where he downloaded something

119
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,360
 Specifically for us and I want to read to you what I wrote down. I wrote this

120
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,280
 He said I'm about to move the vine into uncharted territory. I

121
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,880
 Desire to take you places that you have never been to stretch you beyond what you are currently comfortable with

122
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,720
 These uncharted territories are necessary for your faith and my work. You do not have the strategy

123
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,920
 Resources gifts or wisdom for what is coming, but this is not an issue

124
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,880
 All you need to begin is faith and courage

125
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,240
 This is about complete trust in me what I will give you though is a burden

126
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,240
 I will give you a new heart. I will make you unsatisfied for the here and now

127
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,080
 I will place my hand upon you and stir up the joy of the pursuit of me not beautiful. I

128
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,920
 Want to read that?

129
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:47,120
 Sorry, um, I want to place my hand upon you and stir up the joy of the pursuit of me

130
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,040
 Hands up if you want the joy of pursuing Jesus

131
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
 I

132
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,040
 Am NOT calling you to a vision

133
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,320
 With knowledge of all that is ahead. No, this is uncharted territory

134
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,440
 what I am calling you is to value the value of complete and total surrender a

135
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:13,040
 Holy dissatisfaction in the way things have been and a passionate longing for the discovery of more

136
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,360
 I I then wrote at the bottom need to preach this sometime

137
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,520
 Ha ha ha that's what I'm gonna do now

138
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,360
 As God was downloading this to me

139
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,520
 It was very emotional at that time and very full and I felt the Spirit of God so strongly

140
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,680
 I I immediately began to see a picture in my mind not a not a vision with my eyes awake

141
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,200
 But just a picture in my mind as I I started to reflect and to soak in this word that got a given and it was

142
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,520
 A picture of one of those ancient kind of boats that were used by the early settlers the early pioneers the ones that were were going

143
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,960
 Out towards the discovery of new lands. I could see in my mind's eye this beautiful ship and

144
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,120
 And this ship was was in harbor in in kind of safe harbor

145
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,680
 But the ship was filled with people who were beginning to get ready for the journey that was ahead and and there were all these sailors

146
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,520
 On the ship and they were all doing their own individual tasks to prepare the boat for it getting ready

147
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,800
 the boat begins to move as the people begin to

148
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,920
 Navigate out of the safe harbor and out into the waters and at the bow of the boat in my mind's eye

149
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,120
 I could see the captain of the boat and he's standing at the front there with like a telescope and he's leaning forward and he's looking

150
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:33,160
 Out into the waters ahead and the sense was that everybody on this boat was excited and nervous at the same time

151
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,480
 They were excited because they were about to go on this great adventure

152
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,160
 They're about to be launched out and and they were wondering what might be out there and and they had prepared

153
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,880
 themselves for this and they all had their own little part to play and as they did their own little part the boat could move

154
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,720
 Out into what was unknown, but they were nervous because they didn't know what was out there

155
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,040
 They didn't know what was beyond this was uncharted territory. It was uncharted waters

156
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,760
 No one had been there before they didn't have a map

157
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,200
 The map was not

158
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,120
 Existing to enable them to navigate the place where they were going

159
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,320
 So the captain's leaning forward with his telescope and he's thinking to himself

160
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,600
 Well, either there's endless amounts of sea out there or we're gonna come across some land, but we have no idea

161
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
 What we do have is an undeniable

162
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
 hope

163
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,560
 We have an undeniable

164
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,960
 Burden inside of us that there is something out there to be discovered and not only that but we have this

165
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,680
 unrivaled passion

166
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,800
 Unrivaled passion that although we're afraid and although we don't have the answers and although it's a little

167
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,720
 Uncomfortable and we might go out there and fail we might go out there and discover nothing

168
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,800
 But we're going to go and see what's there because I cannot deny the burden that is inside of me the undeniable

169
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,640
 Hope that is driving me and the unrivaled passion that is moving me

170
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,960
 and

171
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,660
 This picture so resonated with me

172
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:08,720
 Because I could get a sense that this is what God is calling the vine into in this the season that we're now moving into

173
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,240
 That this is our uncharted territory time

174
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,480
 This is our time where we are going to be in uncharted waters

175
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,120
 We've talked to you on vision Sunday over the last number of years about the river model that we have here at the vine

176
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,800
 The river model being this idea that church is not 90 minutes on a Sunday

177
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,280
 It's not people in a building the church is like a river

178
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,880
 Flowing in its city. We the people of Christ actively engaged in our sphere of influence

179
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,440
 We've been saying at the beginning of this year

180
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,360
 This is a year for action that we are to take our faith and live it more publicly

181
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,880
 So I'm standing here before you today on vision Sunday

182
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,160
 And I'm saying here's the thing that God is really saying in a year of action and wanting us to live our faith more publicly

183
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
 It's going to be uncharted

184
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,760
 There's not going to be a map

185
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,200
 We don't have the strategy the resources the wisdom to be able to conquer what is ahead in fact

186
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,280
 God has so designed it that our phone has died

187
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:13,120
 He doesn't want us to be relying on the old things that we've always relied on

188
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,920
 No, you see when God moves a church or a people into an uncharted time

189
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,040
 It's specifically to get them to focus off of what they were relying on that wasn't him and begin to focus

190
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
 directly on him

191
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,640
 Like me and that Camino going Jesus. I need you now because I have nothing else

192
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,080
 We believe that God is moving the vine now into a time where we

193
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,360
 Collectively as God's people are gonna have to say Lord if you don't show up

194
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,020
 We have no idea where to go

195
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:54,480
 And we're gonna be in a season where God is going to do some things that we have never experienced

196
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,040
 Before I believe we're gonna see this in an outpouring of his spirit here on Sundays

197
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,640
 But I believe we're also gonna see it happening in our cities in the corridors of power

198
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,480
 We're gonna see it in the marketplace. We're gonna see it in the educational institutions around us

199
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,240
 We're gonna see God do some things that we don't have a map currently for

200
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,960
 and

201
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,880
 The temptation for us is to try to go back to what we've done in the past to try to give us some

202
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,900
 Possibility when we're in an uncomfortable uncharted time and instead God is saying remember the captain on the boat

203
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,520
 What I want you to do is be leaning forward in the bow and yes, it can be uncomfortable

204
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,600
 And yes, it's going to be challenging, but I want you to look forward for I have put an undeniable

205
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,240
 Hope in you for the gospel for your city. I

206
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:49,920
 Love this because when God speaks to us as a church about the season we're in it's not just about us corporately

207
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
 It's also about you individually

208
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,840
 And if this is your home church in Hong Kong if you would say I'm a Viner

209
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,640
 I go to the vine every week or every other week or maybe once every ten months

210
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,040
 But if you say this is my church, I'm a Viner

211
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,240
 This is my community

212
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,160
 then this is not just something for us as a total church because you could sit there throughout this whole talk today and go like

213
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,440
 Oh, wow, God's calling the vine to be uncharted. Well, I'll look forward to each Sunday then and

214
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,040
 You'll miss the point

215
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,400
 Actually, what God's saying is I'm calling you to be uncharted

216
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,520
 I'm calling you into a season where you're not gonna have the strategy gifts wisdom and resource to be able to survive

217
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,600
 I'm actually gonna be

218
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,200
 Placing you in a time where you're gonna fill a little bit out of your depth a little bit overwhelmed where the things that you've relied

219
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,340
 On before are no longer gonna be the things that you can rely on now and I'm gonna do some things in your life

220
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,800
 And around your life where you're gonna be like, I can't believe the Holy Spirit is doing that

221
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,840
 You're gonna see fruit and abundance like you have never seen it before but there is no current

222
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:55,400
 Map, the phone has died and the phone has died because I'm shaking you out of a sense of complacency

223
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,880
 I'm shaking you out of how some of that dust is settled on you and I'm forcing you if you will I'm bringing you I'm

224
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,360
 Inviting you back to trust in me

225
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,120
 This is a

226
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,320
 It's not an easy thing. I think he's calling us to

227
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,240
 But let me give you some ideas of what I think this season's going to be like

228
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,900
 Is he I think like the settlers on the boat who who are both excited and nervous and pushing out from Harbor out to what?

229
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:30,260
 They don't know this is going to be a season of discovery and adventure focused on the unknown, but anticipated

230
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,240
 Let me unpack that for you for a moment the unknown, but anticipated

231
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,360
 It's unknown because that's the very definition of an uncharted season

232
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,000
 We don't know what's ahead and we know that God is saying that there isn't a current strategy

233
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,260
 We have that's gonna help us in what's ahead

234
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,520
 This was amazing when I was sitting there in

235
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,440
 Spain and God was downloading this to me and I was writing this down on that piece of paper

236
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,040
 I remember thinking to myself. This is awesome because I'm the senior pastor here

237
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,520
 I'm supposed to lead here and one of my responsibilities is always to have strategy for you and

238
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,000
 God was saying I'm taking you to a place where you won't have a strategy and I was like, thank you Lord

239
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,900
 So good because I don't know how many years it's been and my wife would tell you if she was here

240
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
 She would tell you that I have spent countless hours

241
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,720
 sleepless nights

242
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,980
 Worrying and processing and praying and discerning and having strategies and look I'm not saying strategies are wrong and bad

243
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,600
 They're not the vine has been blessed over so many years by the faithful

244
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,740
 stewardship of elders and pastors and senior pastors in past seasons and in my season as well

245
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,600
 We've been faithful to discerning a strategy for how to grow this church how to make sure the ministries are going

246
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,520
 Well how to serve our city strategies are great

247
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:49,600
 But could you imagine the lift from me when the Lord said I'm now moving into a place where you will not have a strategy

248
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,400
 That's uncomfortable Andrew

249
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,020
 But it's also a lifting of a burden from you because in that place all you'll need to do is point people to me

250
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:05,680
 And that's what I'm basically standing before you today to do is to say

251
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,760
 We don't have a new fresh vision and we don't have a list of things that the vines gonna do in the next 12 months

252
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,240
 All I'm saying to you is we are in uncharted times

253
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,080
 We have been pushed out of the boat

254
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,920
 We are out of our comfort zone and God is saying in that place

255
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,520
 You are gonna see me do more than you have ever seen me do before

256
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:33,080
 This is a time where it will be unknown for you. But notice what he says but

257
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,480
 Anticipated I love this. In other words just because it's unknown doesn't mean we should be passive towards it

258
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,520
 Follow this church because this is really important

259
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,080
 You know

260
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,840
 You could think that in a season of unchartedness where we don't have a map and we don't have a strategy and we must rely

261
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,440
 On Jesus that's all about Jesus. It's all about him doing it not about us and and so we could adopt a passiveness

262
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,760
 Towards what God is saying. That's not what he's saying. He's saying I want you in the bow of the boat

263
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,000
 I want you with that telescope looking out in hope that undeniable hope for the land that's ahead

264
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,840
 I want you leaning into what I'm doing

265
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,000
 I want you to realize it's unknown, but it doesn't mean you can't anticipate it

266
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,560
 It doesn't mean you can't believe that I'm gonna act

267
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,620
 It doesn't mean that you can't believe and trust that if you push yourself out there, I will be there

268
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:24,600
 It doesn't mean that you can't begin to believe and pray and hope for revival and refreshment

269
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,920
 And renewal in the city. I it'll be unknown for you, but it is something you can anticipate

270
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,840
 It makes sense to you

271
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,200
 So it's gonna be this kind of season

272
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,680
 Here's secondly what I think it is a little bit like me on the Camino and my my phone died and I I needed to

273
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
 to find other ways to navigate

274
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,000
 this is going to be a season a

275
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,680
 Season where well, we're gonna have to have wholehearted trust and reliance in Jesus above above and beyond anything else

276
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:03,200
 What you got to understand is that an uncharted season to us is not an uncharted season to Jesus

277
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,720
 He knows everything that's ahead. He knows there's no land in this world that he's not explored

278
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,400
 There's no land in this world that he's not king and sovereign over and although it is uncharted for us

279
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,720
 Although we've never been there. He has been there. Not only has he been there. He is there

280
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,560
 Not only is he there he's sovereign over that place

281
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:31,720
 So our unchartedness is something that he is sovereign over and so what we need to do is shift away from the other

282
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,040
 Things we've been relying on and put our full trust in him

283
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,480
 Let me put it this way

284
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:45,180
 You have not been saved by Jesus Christ to be a map follower. You've been saved by Jesus to be a Christ follower

285
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,840
 come on church a

286
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,400
 Christ follower and that doesn't mean again that Christ doesn't help us and give us direction and give us guidance and all that sort of

287
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,700
 Thing of course he does but our primary posture has to be to follow him

288
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,480
 Recognizing that sometimes we end up following other things thinking it's him

289
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,320
 We end up following the things that are

290
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,560
 Comfortable for us or the things that we've relied on in the past or the strategies we've had before or the devotion that we did

291
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,560
 Two years ago that was super helpful for us, but we haven't done a devotion for two years

292
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,960
 And we begin to think that that if we just rely on the things that we've had before

293
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,800
 We'll be fine and God is basically saying in a season of unchartedness

294
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,840
 The whole point of it is that I'm bringing you to trust more in me

295
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:33,400
 That the old things need to be let go of and a fresh dedication to following me

296
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,720
 The phone has died vine

297
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,360
 Come on church

298
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,280
 The phone is dead

299
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,840
 The very thing that we've been relying on he's saying that's not going to happen. There's no strategy. No resources. No gift. No wisdom

300
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,420
 But there is me and as you stay tethered to me

301
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,000
 Sure, then the other things will flow the things you will need for this season

302
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,440
 It will come but your primary posture in this time is me

303
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,800
 Which is the third point of a season like this a little bit like the men and women that you see in the Bible who?

304
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,480
 Have at times have to re-examine themselves and recommit themselves to the ways of God

305
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,000
 This will be a season where God's people will have to have

306
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,840
 intentional readiness

307
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,680
 Intentional readiness through God where we're prepared not with a plan of action, but a posture of heart

308
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,800
 Come on church, not with a plan of action because if God had showed up and said, okay, this is what I'm doing

309
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,600
 I'm taking you here. I'm gonna do all these things

310
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,240
 We should have a plan of action for that

311
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,600
 But when he says you will not know what it is that I'm doing

312
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,000
 I am moving you out of your comfort zone into a place that you cannot predict

313
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,680
 But I am going to do some things our thing is not get a plan of action

314
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:55,600
 Our thing is let's make sure we're the people of God that we need to be so that when God does something that is uncharted

315
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,280
 We respond

316
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:05,160
 We react we follow we we begin to do we begin to work out the kingdom when we see the kingdom come

317
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:12,600
 And so this is a season not not a call to some strategic plan. It's a season of a call to actually

318
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,080
 reevaluating my heart

319
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,320
 reevaluating my life

320
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,480
 reevaluating the values that I hold inside of me

321
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:27,660
 Reevaluating the brokenness that's sitting within me the recognition that sin so easily tangles

322
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:34,300
 I want to be someone that when I'm in an uncharted season and God suddenly shows up and does something incredible

323
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,300
 I'm like God use me

324
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,520
 and

325
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,240
 For that to happen. I can prepare myself for that

326
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,840
 I may not know what it's going to be, but I want to say yes when it happens

327
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,760
 And so there's this posture of the heart

328
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:57,560
 There's a readiness of the values of my life so that when God moves I respond when God acts

329
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:03,200
 I do when he says who's gonna go I say send me when he says the harvest is plentiful

330
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,280
 But the workers are few I will say I'm one of the few

331
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,680
 And I think this is the culture that he's wanting to now build at the vine in the season that we're now moving into he's

332
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,680
 Intentionally shifted us into a hard

333
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,840
 Uncomfortable not having it all worked out time so that he can rebirth within us a passion

334
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,320
 for him

335
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,080
 Not beautiful that excites Emma

336
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,080
 And it excites me and I know it excites you too

337
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,160
 And these values that that we can have and posture for a season of being uncharted

338
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,960
 Is what we're gonna be talking to you about over the next six weeks starting next week and and the weeks beyond it

339
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,720
 We're gonna actually break down one of the values each week

340
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:54,320
 We're gonna do it by looking at the book of Acts and the beautiful story in Acts where where the first disciples go to take

341
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,720
 The gospel in the Greek or Roman Empire

342
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,720
 I mean talk about uncharted times and

343
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,080
 The values that the disciples had to enable them to react and respond when God moved

344
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,680
 So we're gonna unpack that in the weeks ahead today, though

345
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,920
 I want I want to land us on a specific value a posture of heart that I think is the critical first step

346
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,000
 I think it's the thing that God is saying in a season of unchartedness

347
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,120
 This is the first thing that I call of you and actually when you look through the Gospels

348
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,520
 This was Jesus's first thing he called for everyone when he said like if you want to follow me

349
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:30,060
 He says I want you to lay down your cross lay down your life pick up your cross and follow me

350
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,780
 He calls them to what I would describe as

351
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,120
 sacrificial risk

352
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,840
 And I think if we're if we're being serious as a church about a season of being uncharted

353
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,480
 we have to be serious about the reality that it's gonna require a

354
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,640
 tremendous amount of sacrifice and risk for us to let go of the things that we've been

355
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,960
 Depending on and actually begin to look to Jesus again. We're gonna have to be all in

356
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,920
 in a time when we are feeling completely out of control and

357
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:10,720
 In that Jesus to the crowds to his disciples is constantly teaching them about the ability to move all in for him

358
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,360
 About giving up their lives to follow him. This is the crux of the gospel. It's a death and a resurrection

359
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:24,560
 It's a it's a giving in order to receiving its pull right into the church and current and saying I'm willing to take the dying

360
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:31,360
 Side so that the living side is seen in you. This is the beauty of the gospel and Jesus doesn't sugarcoat it

361
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:38,920
 And he says it's gonna require the giving of yourself the death to yourself the picking up the cross and following me

362
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:45,040
 Let me read to you just Matthew 13 beautiful chapter 8 parables in that chapter about Jesus

363
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,440
 Speaking about the kingdom and what his reign on earth is gonna look like but he narrows in on this idea of risk and

364
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:58,240
 The giving of all in these beautiful two parables. I want to read to you from Matthew 13 starting in verse 44

365
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,040
 Is this okay so far? All right, listen to this the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field

366
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:11,120
 When a man found it he hid it again and then in his joy went and sold all that he had and bought that field

367
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,560
 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls when he found one of great value

368
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,040
 He went away and sold everything he had and he brought it. I

369
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:29,520
 Love these two parables Jesus is bringing and he does this often. He's a master storyteller. He brings two different worlds together in two

370
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,880
 Contrasting but similar parables in the first he talks about a day laborer

371
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:42,520
 These were relatively poor people that kind of rented themselves out to the local farmers for each day of the year to to basically

372
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,560
 Farm their land and and in this particular parable

373
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:51,360
 He has this poor day laborer who's there with his hoe and he's kind of hoeing the ground if you will of the particular

374
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,680
 Farm that he's farming that day and suddenly he discovers a treasure

375
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,360
 Now when we read the parable and we see this we think well, this is just like a weird story, right?

376
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,160
 This is just a fiction story. But actually this happened all the time in the first century

377
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,680
 The land in that those years was so often

378
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:13,640
 Attacked by foreign forces and and there were no like HSBC deposit boxes security boxes in those days

379
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,360
 So what people did if they had valuables like jewelry or whatever?

380
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,000
 They would bury it often in one of their fields in the farm and they wouldn't tell anybody where it was buried

381
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,200
 Or maybe they would tell one person but more most likely they would just keep it to themselves

382
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:32,520
 But they would know exactly where they had buried this treasure. Now. The problem is maybe a year or two later

383
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,480
 They are conscripted into the war. They're killed on the battlefield and they didn't tell anybody where the treasure was

384
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,400
 So suddenly there's this treasure hidden in a field that's going to be hidden in that field for centuries

385
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:49,080
 Until someone finds it and Jesus is picking up on this exact thing. And here's this day with this day labor

386
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:56,640
 Randomly stumbles across this incredible treasure in a field and he understands that if he just pulls the treasure out

387
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
 He can't claim it for himself

388
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,760
 Jewish law in those days was that anything above a field or below the field was

389
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,600
 Part of the ownership of the one who owned the field, right?

390
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:13,840
 so the only way he could own that treasure was by buying the field and then he could remove the treasure and take it and

391
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,120
 The parable pitches him doing exactly that but notice what it says. It says that he sells

392
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,320
 Everything in order to buy that field and notice this it says he did it with joy

393
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,680
 Come on church

394
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:35,000
 Because I know if it had been me and you had asked me to give a little bit I would have been very joyful

395
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 But you asked me to give it all

396
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,680
 Everything and in joy he went sold it all and brought the field

397
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:49,080
 The second parable is a world completely removed from the first but tells the same story in the second one

398
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,560
 It's a little bit more like Hong Kong. Here's a wealthy businessman. He's good at what he does. He's a pearl merchant

399
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,360
 He travels probably in the Persian Sea the Red Sea the Indian Sea

400
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,360
 He probably works with pearl

401
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,020
 Fishermen in those areas and he's constantly on the lookout a little bit like the captain on the front of the bow

402
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:12,520
 Looking for that one pearl that is the pearl his holy grail if you will and here on this day

403
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,480
 He's been searching and looking and finally he discovers that one pearl a great price. And what does he do?

404
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:23,360
 He then sells all of his other stock in order to buy that one pearl

405
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,240
 Now this is incredible risk for both of these individuals and I want you to see something really important here

406
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:36,960
 Jesus is bringing a day laborer and a pearl a wealthy merchant together and saying this is not about whether you're poor or whether

407
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,080
 You're rich. It doesn't matter about your social economic status

408
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,280
 all people are required when it comes to the kingdom to give it all and

409
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:52,760
 So both of them give up everything in order to receive the one thing that is of great price and that was a risk

410
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,160
 It was risky for the poor guy to do all that. He didn't have a lot but he gathered it all together

411
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,640
 He sold it to buy the field

412
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:06,720
 It was risky for the businessman to give away everything or sell everything to buy the one there's this inherent

413
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,380
 Beautiful risk to it and Jesus is saying that's what my kingdom is like

414
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:18,560
 When you see the value of the kingdom, you're willing to give it all you're willing to risk what you have for what you don't have

415
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,120
 You're willing to risk what you know for what you don't know

416
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,120
 You're willing to risk who you are for who you long to become

417
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,920
 And Jesus is saying this is what my my my kingdom is like. This is what it's like when you are in

418
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,880
 Uncharted territory you're willing to sell it all

419
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,960
 So that the kingdom would be seen

420
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,040
 hmm, I

421
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,640
 Think there's so many things we could learn from these parables

422
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,740
 Let me just very briefly highlight a couple of things that I think are important

423
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,080
 The first is this when you're in a season of uncharted waters

424
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,200
 It's really important in that season you you ground yourself in the reality that you need to both

425
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,720
 Intentionally seek out the kingdom of God, but also be responsive to the unexpected activity of that kingdom

426
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,280
 You see in these two parables you see both at play in the first parable

427
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,680
 The the guy is just going about his normal day his normal business his mundane plowing the field

428
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,760
 He wasn't expecting to discover a treasure in that field that day

429
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,080
 but when he does he immediately is prepared through the posture of his heart to

430
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,080
 Joyfully give it all for that and when we're in a season of unchartedness

431
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,600
 What God is saying is I need you to prepare your heart church because there are gonna be moments

432
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,360
 Ahead this year where I'm gonna randomly show up in your everyday

433
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:43,120
 Mundane life or your everyday work life or your everyday family life or your everyday

434
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,720
 Whatever and there are gonna be moments ahead where I'm gonna randomly show up

435
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,160
 You're gonna stumble on the kingdom of God in the gym in the boardroom in the classroom

436
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,480
 And the question is will you respond?

437
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,360
 Will you give it all

438
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:05,240
 Will you go this is a moment of the kingdom of God that I cannot deny and it's worth my everything for this

439
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,000
 That colleague in the workplace who doesn't believe in Jesus and has been a little bit hostile to the faith

440
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,480
 But shares that they're going through a divorce. Will you pray for them?

441
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,000
 That

442
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Person that you you met in the gym

443
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,920
 Who's who's going through a really hard time in life?

444
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:27,440
 Will you take them out for a coffee and share Jesus with them if you know that the Holy Spirit is at work?

445
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,400
 See, this is the kind of mentality the values the culture that he's trying to build here in the vine when he's calling us into

446
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,880
 Uncharted times we have to be willing to react to the

447
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,480
 Unexpected activity of the kingdom of God in our lives. What a joy that is

448
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,320
 But then equally we need to make sure we're intentional in searching it out

449
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,760
 We need to be standing at the bow with the telescope saying I'm not just gonna passively wait for Jesus to do it

450
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,420
 Oh, no, I want to be looking as well. I want to make sure that I'm going into my workplace on a Monday morning

451
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:07,220
 I'm in prayer saying Lord Jesus. Could you show me today who I could be praying for in my workplace Lord Jesus

452
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:13,160
 Would you give me an opportunity to share the gospel today Lord Jesus my mother who I've been trying to share my faith with

453
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,760
 For so long, but I will not give up we have to be intentional in

454
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,800
 Looking for the activity of the kingdom of God and when we see it

455
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,080
 Remember, we won't know what that specific activity is going to be

456
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,840
 But when we see it whether we stumble over it or we're intentional about it we respond

457
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:38,340
 We would not be able to stop the people trying to get into this building to worship with us on a Sunday if we were

458
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,340
 Living truly in uncharted times

459
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,380
 Because we would be so responsive to the work of the kingdom around us

460
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,560
 Risk is hard

461
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,300
 It's not a big deal to risk somebody else's life

462
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,920
 It's not a big deal to risk somebody else's resources

463
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,660
 But when you're called to risk your own

464
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,520
 When you're called to give of yourself

465
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,760
 That's when it gets difficult. That's when it's challenging and that's the second point here in the parable

466
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,960
 You see when you're in uncharted waters, you need to understand that you cannot live two lives

467
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,980
 You cannot live two lives. You can't have one foot in one life and one foot in another life

468
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,980
 You can't you can't expect to only give a little bit

469
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,520
 I love it because if Jesus had come up to the day laborer and said hey

470
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,040
 You just need to give a little bit just give a tenth of what you have and then you could have the whole field

471
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,080
 I think the day laborer would totally do that the merchant

472
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,920
 Oh, you just need to sell off a couple of pieces of your stock and then you'll be fine

473
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,800
 If I was to stand before you today and say hey vine

474
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,520
 We're in a season of unchartedness and you just need to give a little bit. I think all of you be like, let's go Andrew

475
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,040
 But if I stand before you and say we're in a season of uncharted and you need to give everything

476
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,500
 And by that I'm not talking finances

477
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:03,460
 I'm talking about your whole life your values your heart what you're committed to your goals your dedication your time

478
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,760
 And yes your resources giving it all for the kingdom of God. I wonder how many will respond

479
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,920
 But but I I have to present this in the way that Christ is bringing it to us

480
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:22,640
 You cannot have your current life and a better life at the same time at some point. You're gonna have to make a choice

481
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,640
 At some point we're gonna have to repent of some sin at some point

482
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,080
 We're gonna have to try to to receive the grace of God at some point

483
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,520
 We have to commit ourselves to the therapy at some point

484
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,120
 We're gonna ask some people to pray for us at some point

485
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:42,360
 We need to make a change because you cannot have your feet in two different camps and expect to be effective

486
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,200
 He's like in a season of unchartedness

487
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,880
 It's a hundred percent trust in me and you have to be fully in or you're fully out. There's no room for lukewarm

488
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:59,020
 There's no room for it doesn't work in the kingdom of God now that doesn't mean that there isn't a time for us

489
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,720
 It doesn't mean that like I need some time to get my life in order

490
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,440
 I'm I need a process of healing that will go through therapy of repair to time

491
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,140
 I need to take some time to repent of my sin that's gonna happen over time

492
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:15,240
 Of course time frames fine, but the question is where's the posture of your heart?

493
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,840
 The posture that's what Christ is looking for is all in

494
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:25,000
 Even though it might take some time for my life to to change and to get to where I want it to be my posture

495
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,560
 From the start is I want to give it all to Christ. I

496
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,280
 Want to serve him with everything. I

497
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:40,480
 Think he challenges us with this because he recognizes that that that risk is something that that isn't something we naturally do

498
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,080
 You know

499
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,800
 We often think that risk is like, you know

500
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:50,520
 Just random decision-making or like close my eyes and throwing a dart at a dartboard and hoping something sticks or but that's not biblical risk

501
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:58,160
 If I was to define biblical risk for you, I would put it this way biblical risk is this risk is intentionally costly decision-making

502
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,020
 driven by intentionally calculated faith

503
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,880
 And it's both of those things together

504
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,800
 Intentionally costly decision-making. This is gonna hurt me. This is not gonna be easy

505
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,160
 I'm being called to do something that is gonna be challenging for me

506
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,480
 I'm out of my comfort zone, but I'm trusting in Jesus and then intentionally calculated faith

507
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,120
 I'm not just giving up everything because the preacher told me to

508
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:29,200
 But I've actually sat with this I prayed about it. I've asked the Spirit to speak to me. I've looked at the scriptures

509
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,040
 I've had my prayer partners pray with me. I'm in my small group and we're working through this together and we've decided that yes

510
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,520
 The Holy Spirit is asking me to change my job to do this to do that

511
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,560
 And and we've come to a conclusion that this is what God is saying

512
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,960
 so therefore I'm gonna marry the activity of costly decision-making with the

513
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,800
 Calculated faith that I've been intentional about and I'm bringing those two things together

514
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:59,080
 When you do one of those things without the other if you're just making costly decision-making without faith, you're stupid

515
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
 and

516
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,800
 If you are calculating your faith and not doing anything about it, you're a fool

517
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,160
 That's what the Bible says

518
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:15,320
 But it's when we bring the two of those things together that the kingdom of God does something in the city

519
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:21,200
 That's the beauty of this. I think he's shaking us up because yeah, there is some stuff that's sitting on us

520
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,080
 Maybe some apathy we need to shake up

521
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:28,360
 Maybe is there is some reliance on the old and God wants to shake that off so we rely on him again

522
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,560
 Maybe we've been Matt followers and not Christ followers

523
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,080
 There's a whole bunch of things but I think the main reason why Christ is calling us into the uncharted is because of Hong Kong

524
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,040
 It's because of this city. It's because of the people of this city

525
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:47,240
 It's because we should be the pearl merchants looking for the pearls of great price in the people that are around us all the time

526
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:52,680
 See every human being made in the image of God has a pearl of great price within them

527
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,520
 But sin covers it up sin tears it away sin blocks people from seeing it

528
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:05,280
 but when we begin to live and to share and sing the new song of the gospel to people when we begin to stand for

529
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,200
 the faith in

530
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,360
 radical new ways when we begin to love

531
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:14,080
 People and show people the grace and the kindness and the beauty of the kingdom of God when all of those things take place

532
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,960
 We begin to reveal the pearl that is a great price in every person

533
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,480
 And some come to the kingdom of God

534
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
 What a beautiful thing that is

535
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,880
 I can't stand here telling you about risk today

536
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,560
 Without actually then doing something and living that out. It's really interesting as we've been

537
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,680
 Wrestling with this message with you here this morning

538
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,360
 We knew that God was calling us to do something very different on Vision Sunday

539
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:48,560
 Normally on Vision Sunday what we do is we actually invite you after the message to give to give financially to give

540
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,280
 Officially financially we always say above and beyond your normal ties and offerings and to give your finances

541
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,880
 Towards the vision that God has for us

542
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,720
 But as we were sitting as a church and we were wrestling with this as a leadership

543
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,040
 We're realizing that God was saying that's not what actually I want to ask of the people today

544
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,360
 And so we're actually going to be doing something that is intentionally

545
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:16,920
 Risky with you here this morning and by not asking you for financial giving today

546
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,840
 That actually puts the church at a bit of financial risk because normally Vision Sunday is a big offering that helps our church throughout the year

547
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:29,120
 But I cannot stand before you today and talk about taking intentional risk from

548
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:37,060
 Calculated faith and not be obedient by what God said. God said don't ask for giving on this particular day ask for living

549
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:43,980
 Ask for people to live the way that I'm calling them to live ask the people to have

550
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,760
 Values that I'm calling them to have values. That's what needs to be done today

551
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,360
 and look the reality is

552
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,760
 down the line in six months nine months ten months when we discover a treasure in the field or

553
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,920
 We see that pearl of great price and we know that the Holy Spirit is doing something amongst us in our ministries

554
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:09,440
 And we need to respond I will have no shame coming before you on one future Sunday and saying give let's sell everything

555
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,520
 And let's get the treasure in the field. Let's get the pearl of great price

556
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,440
 I will have no problem in the future coming before you and asking for your money

557
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,240
 But today

558
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
 That wouldn't be the right thing to do

559
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,280
 Today I want to unpack this and ask you for you

560
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,000
 Ask for your life

561
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,960
 ask for that

562
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:37,600
 Posture of heart that we've been talking about the preparation for what is ahead. I want you in that boat excited and nervous

563
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:43,880
 Playing your part ready to discover whatever it is. That's out there. The phone has died

564
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,840
 The way we do this is through consecration

565
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,440
 Consecration is this biblical idea that you can see we don't have time to go into it now

566
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,560
 But on Tuesday night, here's what I want to call you to on Tuesday night

567
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,680
 We're having a prayer night and it's happening here at 730 and the whole night is going to be an act of consecration

568
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,800
 And we're gonna lead you through a place of consecration on Tuesday night

569
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,200
 I want to encourage everyone in this church to come

570
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,240
 Which means that if you all did that's a big problem and it's a good problem to have

571
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:22,280
 But I want to call you to come because over that night we're going to consecrate ourselves to this new season

572
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:28,400
 And in order to prepare for that I'm gonna lead us in a moment in this just in a few seconds of

573
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,600
 Consecration here today, which is just a precursor of what we want to do in more detail on

574
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,120
 Tuesday night

575
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:41,680
 Consecration biblically defined is cleansing plus sacrifice plus devotion cleansing sacrifice

576
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:48,720
 Devotion and many times God calls his people to a place of consecration. I'm gonna read one scripture and then we're gonna pray

577
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,240
 Let me read this to you from

578
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,840
 from Joshua chapter 3

579
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,760
 Because I want you to hear how God calls his people into this

580
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,160
 Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan where they camped before crossing over

581
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:08,000
 after three days the officers went throughout the camp giving orders to the people when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your

582
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,280
 God and the priests who are Levites carrying it you are to move out from your positions and follow it

583
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:17,920
 Then you will know which way to go. It's known as this since you have never been this way before there it is

584
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,240
 You are about to go into uncharted times

585
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,120
 God is telling Joshua and the Israelites you never been in the promised land before this is a land

586
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,320
 You have never set foot in before you have never been this way before

587
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,800
 Then you will know which way to go since you have never been this way before but keep a distance of about a thousand yards

588
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,040
 Between you and the Ark do not go near Joshua told the people here it is

589
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,120
 consecrate yourselves

590
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,440
 For tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you. I believe wholeheartedly that tomorrow

591
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:53,200
 however, that will be defined God is gonna do some amazing things amongst us it begins though in consecration a

592
00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:00,200
 Cleansing Lord, would you forgive me of my sin and wash me afresh with your blood a sacrifice Lord

593
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,880
 I'm willing to posture my heart so that when you act I'm willing to respond with everything a

594
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,080
 devotion a holy pursuit remember I said in that

595
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:15,040
 Download I wrote down on the piece of paper the joy of the pursuit of God

596
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:22,120
 the devotion the scripture reading the prayer the quiet times the small group commitment

597
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,040
 whatever it is the devotion the pursuit the positive pursuit of

598
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,800
 The presence of God as we cleanse and sacrifice and devote ourselves. We

599
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,400
 consecrate ourselves to a season of being uncharted and

600
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,720
 That's what I want to call us to now

601
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,280
 So I wonder whether you would do an important thing with me and this is if you feel this

602
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,360
 This is something for you to respond to it may not be possible for everybody because the chairs can be super tightly packed

603
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,000
 But the posture in the scriptures around consecration is a humble one. It's a posture being on the knees

604
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:58,060
 So I wonder as I pray for us on this vision Sunday as we dedicate ourselves to uncharted times ahead

605
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:01,000
 You would join me on your knees. Let's pray together

606
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:15,720
 As you get on your knees

607
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,480
 One of the things that we're going to do and I want you just to be in this posture of prayer

608
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,440
 In a moment, I'm gonna have our hosts pass out

609
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,880
 Communion elements to you and we're gonna take communion as a response today. But before that I want to pray for us

610
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,280
 So, let's just posture our hearts before him

611
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,600
 Father we thank you so much for this moment

612
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,800
 Lord, we don't take this lightly

613
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,080
 Lord your church on your knees before you it's a beautiful thing

614
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:56,800
 But I really thank you Lord that the phone has died I

615
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,640
 Thank you Lord that you've moved us out of our comfort zone I

616
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:08,000
 Thank you that you so love this city that you're calling your church to its knees

617
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,320
 To be consecrated before you

618
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:18,040
 So that like the day labor and the merchants we would joyfully give it all

619
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,360
 On behalf of what you're about to do. We don't know what you're gonna do

620
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:31,180
 We don't have the strategy the resources the gift of the wisdom, but what we do have is you

621
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:38,160
 And you believe that the cost of giving your life was enough that we were worth it

622
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,600
 And Lord as we are here on our knees before you it's our way of saying you are worth it

623
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:50,200
 Father I pray for every person here is going through difficult times

624
00:48:50,200 --> 00:49:00,040
 Lord I want to pray that this year be a year of uncharted fruit and breakthrough

625
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,800
 Lord for those in this room who are struggling

626
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,420
 Lord I want to pray for uncharted peace

627
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:18,160
 Uncharted peace

628
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,080
 Lord most of all

629
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,880
 For all of us here who call the vine our home church

630
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,760
 Lord we humble ourselves on our knees and we ask for outrageous faith

631
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,920
 We ask for a faith that is way beyond what we currently hold

632
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,680
 We ask for the joy that was in that day laborer

633
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,240
 To give it all

634
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,240
 Lord we cleanse

635
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,000
 ourselves through the washing of your blood

636
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,640
 through the forgiveness of

637
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,400
 Your grace to the forgiveness of our sins

638
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,280
 Lord I want to pray your blood over every person in this room

639
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:02,320
 Lord there are sins that many of us carry some that deeply entangle. Lord we pray for freedom in the name of Jesus

640
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:08,080
 Lord we pray for the blood to cleanse your church to purify your bride

641
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:16,280
 Lord we pray for the sacrifices that are to come. Lord I want to pray that you would put a burden and an

642
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:23,280
 unreasonable hope in each person in this room that they would give up their time and their energy and their

643
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:30,320
 Resource and their life and their decisions for your kingdom Lord Jesus. It'll look different for every single one of us

644
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:36,960
 Lord in our workplaces our education institutions our families our homes Lord would you move?

645
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:45,680
 Lord would you ask us a high price Lord and would your church be willing to give?

646
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,160
 And father we pray for devotion

647
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:57,840
 To be stirred. Lord I want to pray for a fire in the name of Jesus over every single person here

648
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:03,560
 For your word. I want to pray that your Bible would come alive in the hearts of our church like never before

649
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,160
 Lord I want to pray that people would be hungry to read the scriptures

650
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:13,360
 Those of us myself included at times that fall asleep when we read the scriptures. Would you keep us awake Lord?

651
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,680
 Would you bring your word alive? Would you speak Lord?

652
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:23,440
 Would we be like the disciples on the road to Damascus who would honor you by saying we're not our hearts burning within us

653
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:30,320
 When you open the scriptures to us Lord would prayer be released over the divine church in the name of Jesus Lord

654
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:36,640
 Would we find ourselves on our knees praying for one another praying for our city praying for the loss

655
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,040
 Praying for revival Lord would you break us Lord?

656
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,000
 Lord would devotion be here in the name of Jesus

657
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,840
 Lord we consecrate ourselves

658
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:57,000
 So in this posture of consecration, I'm gonna invite the host just to come and they're gonna pass out the bread

659
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,880
 They're gonna pass out the cup and they're gonna pass out both of those things at the same time

660
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,440
 I want you to just take in your hand

661
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:09,120
 And don't don't allow the elements to break

662
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:15,480
 Where you are in prayer right now, but just receive them keep them in your hand both the cup and the bread

663
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,960
 We're gonna share them all together as one church in a moment

664
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:26,520
 But the communion is where we are unifying our expression of consecration today

665
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:36,360
 And I'm gonna invite Carla she's gonna come and just lead us in a time of communion in just a moment

666
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,360
 You

667
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,360
 You

668
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,940
 (gentle music)

669
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:52,940
