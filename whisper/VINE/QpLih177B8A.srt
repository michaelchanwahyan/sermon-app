1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
 And we thank you, Jesus.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,120
 In your name we pray.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,120
 Amen, amen.

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
 Over to you.

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,120
 Thanks, Jess.

6
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,260
 So I'm sure you would agree with me that there have been some pretty incredible inventions

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,360
 over the years, the centuries, right?

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:23,560
 That really have transformed and revolutionized how we do things, even the simple things,

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,160
 you know, like a light bulb.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,760
 Could you imagine if we didn't have a light bulb?

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
 Technology.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,760
 Even an umbrella.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,400
 Who was thankful for the invention of an umbrella today?

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,160
 The World Wide Web Internet as we know it.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,400
 I mean, sometimes we may not be thankful, but I think the majority of us would say technology

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,440
 has advanced at incredible paces, and if you're watching online, you get to benefit with that

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,200
 as well today.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:04,280
 Well, one of my favorite inventions has to be the Kindle.

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,600
 I love the Kindle.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,680
 Now I know all of you book lovers out there, you know, the ones that like to touch and

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,800
 feel and smell the pages.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,840
 Yes, yes, I know we're getting nods here.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,080
 Heather Rose, I know you're watching online.

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,240
 I know you love your books as well.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,520
 Well, I love the books, the Kindles, especially living in Hong Kong, because you know what

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,600
 it's like if we have too many books?

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,160
 Where do we put them?

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,760
 So with a Kindle, you can have hundreds of books, and you do not have to worry about

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,840
 storage, right?

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:50,000
 I love my Kindle because I love reading, and I love stories, and stories can be powerful

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,680
 tools that really do shape how we think and how we view the world.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,880
 Think of your favorite movie or book.

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,680
 When you're immersed in that book or that movie, and you are so engrossed with what's

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,800
 happening, you have no idea what's happening outside of that book or that movie, and your

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,520
 brain is telling you that you are part of that story.

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,520
 Well, there is a term for this.

37
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,200
 It's called narrative transportation theory.

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,920
 Did you know that?

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
 It's true.

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,800
 It's amazing what you learn here in church.

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,600
 Narrative transportation theory, seriously.

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:42,080
 This suggests that the power of stories can actually change attitudes and intentions that

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,680
 are reflected in the story.

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,040
 I am 100% convinced this is true.

45
00:02:50,040 --> 00:03:00,640
 When I watch Tomb Raider, I am Lara Croft, and I am abseiling down the IFC.

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,800
 Now if you've never watched Tomb Raider, you have no idea what I'm talking about, but the

47
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:13,120
 point is in our 21st century, with social media, we know that stories impact us.

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,440
 It can be negative, and it can be positive.

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,240
 And I love that Jesus was way ahead of all the philosophers and the psychologists of

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,480
 the past and the influencers of the present in understanding how stories draw listeners

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,680
 in.

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,800
 They influence thoughts, feelings, and behavior.

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:46,600
 And as we come to the end of our series on parables, we have seen how Jesus used stories

54
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,960
 to disrupt, to challenge, and inspire.

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,280
 Jesus was not just a great storyteller.

56
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,840
 Jesus intentionally provoked the imagination of his audience to dismantle their views of

57
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:14,120
 the world, in particular its value system, so that the true nature of God's world would

58
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,320
 be revealed, and that would inspire change.

59
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,440
 Jesus knew that the people that gathered around him, those that loved him, those that hated

60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,200
 him, and those that weren't quite sure what they thought about him, were far more likely

61
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:40,280
 to be challenged to look at the world differently when they heard parables, stories that they

62
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,480
 could help see the world, force them to think, make choices.

63
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:56,520
 Do they embrace this new upside-down value system, or do they ignore it and just continue

64
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,640
 with life as they have always done and face the consequences?

65
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,040
 And this week, we are looking at the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, found in the

66
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
 Gospel of Luke.

67
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:18,120
 So as we open up God's word, as we listen to Jesus's words, let's also be willing to

68
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:27,200
 dismantle our own worldviews, challenge some of our behaviors, so that we are inspired

69
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,080
 to live a kingdom lifestyle.

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,640
 And as I read through Luke now, I want to invoke your imagination.

71
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,960
 We're going to do that through words and art.

72
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,360
 And so as I read, you will see various artistic interpretations of this parable presented

73
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,240
 over the centuries.

74
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:59,720
 So sit back, look, and listen.

75
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,680
 There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.

76
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,240
 At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores, longing to eat what fell

77
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,560
 from the rich man's table.

78
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
 Even the dogs came and licked his sores.

79
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,180
 The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side.

80
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,040
 The rich man also died and was buried in Hades, where he was in torment.

81
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,240
 He looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side.

82
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,840
 So he called to him, "Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip

83
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,160
 of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire."

84
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,040
 But Abraham replied, "Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things

85
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,480
 while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.

86
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,080
 And besides all this, between us and you, a great chasm has been set in place, so that

87
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:10,120
 those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us."

88
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,640
 He answered, "Then I beg you, Father, send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers.

89
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,640
 Let him warn them so that they will not also come to this place of torment."

90
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,360
 Abraham replied, "They have Moses and the prophets.

91
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,200
 Let them listen to them."

92
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,680
 "No, Father Abraham," he said, "but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent."

93
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,280
 He said to them, "If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced,

94
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:49,880
 even if someone rises from the dead."

95
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:56,920
 So what was Jesus trying to convey to the audience of his day?

96
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:02,780
 From the previous verses, we can assume that Jesus is addressing the parable to his disciples

97
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,080
 and to the Pharisees, who had earlier been sneering at Jesus when Jesus was teaching

98
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,320
 the disciples that you cannot love God and money.

99
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:21,240
 And as Jesus begins this parable, we know, or we can just imagine, how annoyed the Pharisees

100
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,720
 were beginning to be with Jesus.

101
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,020
 There are two main characters that Jesus introduces at the start, the rich man and Lazarus.

102
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,320
 And we have vivid descriptions that leave the listeners in no doubt that we have someone

103
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,800
 very wealthy who's living a life of luxury and indulgence in contrast to a man named

104
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,400
 Lazarus, who is living in inhumane misery.

105
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,880
 Even the dogs are mistreating him.

106
00:08:51,880 --> 00:09:00,640
 He's destitute, isolated, alone, hungry, physically and emotionally suffering.

107
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:08,400
 Now interestingly, this is the only parable where Jesus actually names one of his characters.

108
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,640
 And scholars debate various different reasons why Jesus does this.

109
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:21,400
 But what it does show is how significant this suffering man was to God.

110
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,640
 Calling someone by their name is very personal.

111
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,920
 It invokes a connection to that person.

112
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:35,800
 And here, our pearl man is named Lazarus, which actually means God helps, and which

113
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,760
 we see as being prophetic as the story unfolds.

114
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,280
 This is an important reminder to us today.

115
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:56,800
 And it should be a comfort in a world where it is easy to feel nameless and unknown, forgotten,

116
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,640
 unseen.

117
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:07,000
 God does know us, he does see us, and he calls us by name.

118
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,800
 Some of you are here today, and maybe immediately you identify with Lazarus.

119
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,280
 You too are suffering in your own ways.

120
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,120
 You don't feel seen.

121
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,240
 You don't feel heard.

122
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
 You don't feel known.

123
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,880
 You have huge needs that are crushing you at times, needs that you share and needs that

124
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,920
 you hold, and only you know the weight of them.

125
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:43,920
 Well, my prayer for you today is as we unfold this story together, that while you're here,

126
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,600
 you would experience the Holy Spirit ministering very personally to you.

127
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:56,240
 Because as I stand here and I look out at lots of different faces, God looks out and

128
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,320
 he sees every one of you and knows you by name.

129
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,840
 May God minister to you personally, and may you leave here being known, being seen, being

130
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,640
 loved, and with hope.

131
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:23,600
 Jesus makes this contrast with a nameless rich man who doesn't invoke any sympathy.

132
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,280
 And even though Lazarus is on the doorstep of the rich man, he's lying right in front

133
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:34,120
 of him, there is no excuse for not knowing that this Lazarus is there.

134
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:43,680
 But the rich man is portrayed as doing nothing, simply living his life his way every day.

135
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,840
 And then as the story unfolds, we see a dramatic switch in their circumstances, which happens

136
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,320
 when they both die.

137
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,520
 Death comes to us all.

138
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,560
 This would have been a reminder to everyone, it's a reminder for us today, regardless whether

139
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,960
 you're rich, you're poor, whether you obey the law, you don't obey the law, whether you're

140
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:17,000
 a good person or whether you're a bad person, nobody can escape death.

141
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,920
 There is no escaping death, and there's no escaping judgment after death.

142
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,560
 But there is also hope, and that's what we see in Lazarus.

143
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:36,800
 Hope also for us as believers in Jesus that despite the challenges that we face now, despite

144
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:46,960
 the pain or the suffering that we endure, we will know hope, we will know comfort.

145
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,120
 Now Jesus is drawing on the ancient Jewish teachings of that day, which for sure the

146
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,500
 Pharisees would have been very familiar with.

147
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:03,680
 He introduces his listeners into the afterlife, the concept of paradise and hell, which in

148
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,520
 the Greek is referred to by Luke as Hades.

149
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,960
 It's strong imagery, would have been very familiar, very familiar to the Jewish people

150
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:21,920
 of Jesus' day, which paints that picture of this great patriarchal figure of Abraham comforting

151
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:29,440
 and blessing Lazarus while the rich man is suffering and in great torment.

152
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 And again, the power in Jesus' storytelling is that it was relatable to his audience,

153
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:43,480
 its familiar language, its culture, and its beliefs that were prevalent at their time.

154
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,640
 The Pharisees believed in a bodily resurrection with life after death, where good deeds were

155
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,920
 rewarded and bad deeds punished.

156
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,880
 So they would have had no problem accepting that Abraham was in paradise, welcoming the

157
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,340
 righteous.

158
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,440
 No doubt the Pharisees though, living with an assumed presumption that they were all

159
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,760
 going to go to paradise one day.

160
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:20,480
 But as Jesus depicts in this particular parable, the one rewarded here and the one punished

161
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:28,280
 portrays a very different value system, which would have challenged his listeners.

162
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:34,840
 You see, what is interesting is that the rich man is not portrayed as having committed a

163
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,680
 particular sin.

164
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,300
 Doesn't look like he actually did anything wrong.

165
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,320
 Having money, being blessed with material wealth is not a sin.

166
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,040
 Jesus never said it was.

167
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,720
 Rather it is how we live with what we have.

168
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:03,440
 And in this case, it is the rich man's inaction and selfish living for himself that Jesus

169
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,800
 is calling out.

170
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,320
 Jesus is not condemning him for being rich.

171
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,440
 This is not a parable against those that have plenty.

172
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,680
 But Jesus' story was showing in the kingdom of God of which Jesus was there to proclaim,

173
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:28,200
 the poor and the suffering would be comforted and be rewarded as righteous and those that

174
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,160
 lived for themselves would be held to account.

175
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,760
 Not only is Jesus highlighting the lack of action by the rich man, he also portrays the

176
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,400
 rich man's arrogance.

177
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,000
 This is arrogant attitude.

178
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,840
 It continues right after his death.

179
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:57,120
 His language may be respectful to Father Abraham, but he has this expectation that Lazarus should

180
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,600
 come and serve him.

181
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,540
 It's almost demonstrating this sense of entitlement.

182
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,720
 There is this assumption by the rich man that Lazarus should leave his place of blessing

183
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:18,200
 by Abraham's side and go over and join him to alleviate his suffering.

184
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,400
 And Abraham's response to this is basically, "No."

185
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,680
 He points out a very different set of values, very different set of values and a sense of

186
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,480
 justice.

187
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,960
 After all, the rich man had already received all his good things on earth as Abraham had

188
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,800
 told him.

189
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,280
 And only then do we see a glimpse of the rich man thinking of others as he pleads on behalf

190
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,600
 of his brothers.

191
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:53,400
 But again, the response from Abraham implies that the rich man neglected scripture, its

192
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:01,360
 teachings, and even a miracle of somebody rising from the dead would make no difference.

193
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,440
 I cannot help but imagine how the readers of the Gospel of Luke would have made that

194
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:13,560
 connection right at the early church between Jesus' own resurrection and how true his words

195
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:24,040
 would be in their context when even after Jesus rose again, so many refused to believe.

196
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,240
 The kingdom of God was at the heart of Jesus' teaching.

197
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,560
 Not only did his parables focus on helping people to understand how the kingdom functioned,

198
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:41,520
 but he also challenged people to change their behaviors when seeking his kingdom.

199
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,920
 The Pharisees, many, many of the religious leaders of Jesus' day, they focused heavily

200
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,740
 on the law, or they appeared to do so.

201
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:59,220
 But they neglected the spirit behind God's law, the heart of God.

202
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,880
 They ignored the real needs of the people around them, and Jesus would not tolerate

203
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,840
 that.

204
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,560
 Jesus was so confrontational to the religious leaders at his time.

205
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,360
 You just need to read Matthew 23.

206
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,520
 I love Matthew 23.

207
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:26,040
 Jesus absolutely slams the religious leaders of his time.

208
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:34,320
 They represented the antithesis of who God is, his heart for the poor and the vulnerable.

209
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:43,160
 The Pharisees themselves played needless burdens on the people, and Jesus called them proud,

210
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:51,440
 boastful, show-offs, blind fools, pretenders, a brood of snipers.

211
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,000
 The list just goes on.

212
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,320
 In the kingdom of God, the poor, the suffering, the downcast, the oppressed are not unknown

213
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,600
 by God.

214
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,040
 They will be blessed.

215
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:10,920
 Never think that God is not aware or concerned with those living in poverty, those that are

216
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,160
 vulnerable, those that are suffering or oppressed.

217
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,200
 Scripture's very clear how much God is on the side of the vulnerable and speaks again

218
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:27,760
 and again for the justice for the marginalized and comfort to those who are in pain.

219
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,400
 That is a comfort to us.

220
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,640
 The disciples were also present listening to this story, and I wonder what went through

221
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,040
 their minds.

222
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,440
 Did they relate to Lazarus and his suffering?

223
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,160
 Some of them would have had to have left their own material comforts as they followed Jesus,

224
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,560
 suffered their own hardship and persecution along the way.

225
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,200
 But they would have witnessed time and time again of Jesus modeling to them what it means

226
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,560
 to reach out and care for the poor, for the suffering.

227
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:13,840
 Jesus didn't ignore it, and his disciples could not either, and neither should we.

228
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:21,400
 Jesus spoke parables to teach about God's world that was in the present and in the future.

229
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:28,680
 And he lived out this new world by healing the sick, setting the oppressed free, caring

230
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:34,480
 for the poor, speaking up for the marginalized.

231
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,080
 And the disciples were in the midst of seeing the kingdom of God at work in real time with

232
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:47,480
 Jesus, and they were challenged also to make their own choices in how they responded in

233
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,680
 their own actions and attitudes.

234
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,960
 Those hearing this parable would have understood it to mean inaction and indifference to the

235
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,920
 poor and suffering were not acceptable in the kingdom of God, never has been and never

236
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,520
 will be.

237
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,280
 So what does this actually mean for us?

238
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,960
 How does this parable reshape our worldviews?

239
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,840
 How does it challenge us?

240
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:26,760
 How does it inspire us to live proactively with kingdom values, and maybe sometimes those

241
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,800
 values that are countercultural?

242
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:39,560
 I think for many of us, we do respond practically to help the poor and the marginalized.

243
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:46,560
 We use our resources in various ways, whether it's our time, our finances, our skill set.

244
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,000
 And I know many of you here are very generous.

245
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,520
 I just heard recently that there are a group of you that every Monday you're cooking on

246
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,400
 the first floor in our kitchen, preparing food, and then you're going out and you're

247
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
 feeding the homeless.

248
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,600
 And you've been doing that for years.

249
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:14,600
 I know that many of you work for NGOs or are in professions that care for others, that

250
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:22,280
 require you to advocate daily for those that maybe are of a lesser social status.

251
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:29,080
 There are many of you here that are providing extra support to the poor and the marginalized.

252
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,480
 And some of you are in positions of power, of influence, and you are choosing to make

253
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,040
 a difference, to use your resources to help others.

254
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,200
 You will hear us preach and teach from the front about the importance of social justice,

255
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,960
 about how it's important to treat each other respectfully and fairly.

256
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,960
 We will even call each other out when we've witnessed or seen some behaviors that don't

257
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,280
 treat people fairly, and we've spoken about those from the front as well.

258
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,120
 And that's all good.

259
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,440
 And let's keep doing good.

260
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:17,280
 And let's keep using our resources and making a difference and being a light in this city.

261
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:26,280
 But what I want to ask us is a question around how easily it is for our attitudes to subtly

262
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:33,840
 change which actually will affect our response and our relationship to those in need and

263
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,720
 our relationship to God.

264
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,640
 And we need to be on guard of those so we don't find ourselves suddenly acting like

265
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,320
 the rich man.

266
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:52,040
 I think the first attitude that we need to watch out for is this indifference.

267
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,160
 Indifference can come subtly towards us.

268
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,120
 We see it in this parable, even though the needs of Lazarus are very clearly in front

269
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,480
 of the rich man every single day, the rich man ignores him.

270
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,800
 And I think it can creep into our own lives without realizing it as our hearts can suddenly

271
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,720
 become a little bit hard.

272
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,760
 The reality is the world has a lot of needs.

273
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,520
 It can feel overwhelming at times.

274
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:31,920
 Many years ago, my husband and I, we set up a charity that was involved in working with

275
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,760
 a country that was facing huge economic collapse.

276
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,240
 We were specifically working with abandoned children.

277
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
 We were newly married.

278
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,360
 And honestly, there was a lot of sacrifice that went into setting this up, traveling,

279
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,560
 and not just the time but the money as well.

280
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:02,160
 And after a while, the demands, the constant demands that we, that I felt, started to get

281
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,200
 to me.

282
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,320
 And it wasn't until after a few years that I realized that actually I had become a little

283
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:18,320
 bit indifferent to those immediate needs around me, and that a sense of hardened heart had

284
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,200
 crept in.

285
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:29,240
 And I knew that because I found that I had this subconscious attitude of, "I've done

286
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,120
 enough.

287
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,400
 I've done a lot.

288
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,520
 I'm tired.

289
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,960
 I've done enough."

290
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,080
 Of course, I wouldn't say it, but I realized that that was something that was very real

291
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,320
 in my life.

292
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,680
 And it was only when I actually went to God and said, "You know what, God?

293
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:56,320
 I need you to break my heart for what breaks yours."

294
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:05,400
 And as Christians, I think that's something that we have got to regularly be asking ourself

295
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,200
 and praying.

296
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,360
 It's not enough to do it just because it's the right thing to do.

297
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:21,280
 But if we could regularly ask God, "God, break my heart for what breaks yours," then that

298
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:30,200
 would keep our hearts soft and that attitude of indifference away.

299
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,960
 The second attitude to be mindful of is entitlement.

300
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,040
 Oh, yes, it's a subtle one as well.

301
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,120
 And I'm sure at various times in our lives, we have had that sense of entitlement where

302
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,940
 you think you deserve special treatment.

303
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,520
 Maybe it's, "I've studied really, really hard and I've gone to a great university and therefore

304
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,040
 I deserve to have that better job with more benefits."

305
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,680
 Or maybe it's a case of, "Well, actually, I come from a first world country and therefore

306
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:12,360
 I'm a lot more knowledge educated than maybe somebody else."

307
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:24,440
 Maybe it's, "I don't have enough and you have a lot and so therefore you should help me."

308
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,600
 You see, entitlement has many different levels, but it does creep in.

309
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,040
 The rich man's sense of entitlement, that was clear, seen in his expectation even after

310
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,560
 death when he thought Lazarus should go over and serve him.

311
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:48,720
 There was no awareness that he had done anything wrong, but rather excuse after excuse.

312
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:56,480
 But in contrast, we see Lazarus who actually doesn't say a word throughout the whole parable.

313
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,580
 He doesn't complain about his life.

314
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,840
 He doesn't complain or express any resentment with the rich man.

315
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:11,600
 There's no gloating or suffering now that the rich man is in a different position.

316
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,560
 I'm not sure I would be so gracious.

317
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,600
 So we need to check our hearts.

318
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:25,240
 We need to check our hearts for that entitlement and we need to have that humility where we

319
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:34,440
 recognize that actually all that we have is given by God and that everything belongs to

320
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
 God.

321
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,280
 And that humility keeps us in an attitude where we are constantly again reflecting and

322
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:49,400
 choosing to follow God's ways, have his heart so that that's the attitude that we're responding

323
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,960
 to others with.

324
00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:00,800
 But imagine in the city of Hong Kong or the place where you're residing now, if we as

325
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:07,320
 followers of Jesus decided to adopt the kingdom principles which saw us acting in generous

326
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:14,560
 ways, kindness and compassion to everyone around us.

327
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,880
 Recently the Hong Kong Tourism Board launched a new campaign to encourage people to be more

328
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:26,280
 hospitable to each other, especially the tourists, right?

329
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,840
 I don't know why but apparently we as Hong Kongers can be rather unfriendly and rude.

330
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,600
 I don't think that's true.

331
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,960
 But anyway, I actually think it came from this kindness movement that Singapore launched

332
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,560
 a number of years ago.

333
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:45,000
 They also said that they would like their people to be encouraged to be kinder to each

334
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,820
 other, especially to the tourists.

335
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,600
 We live in such a transactional world.

336
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,960
 Let's be kind because then more people will like us, then they will spend more money and

337
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,840
 that will help our economy grow.

338
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,600
 The world that Jesus spoke about was the opposite.

339
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,360
 This is not how the kingdom of God operates.

340
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,840
 This is not how we should approach our relationship to the poor or those in need.

341
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:24,520
 So when we realize we do not deserve anything and yet God gave everything, that should want

342
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:34,440
 us to respond in generosity towards each other for no expected return.

343
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:45,160
 Whether we have plenty, whether we have less, we are all able to lead this city and show

344
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,960
 because we represent God's way.

345
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,080
 And how can we practically respond to this message?

346
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,320
 What does it actually look like when we leave this place?

347
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,600
 Well back in Easter, my family and I, we went to Taiwan.

348
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,080
 We had a couple of days in Taiwan and we were in this particular place one day where we

349
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,480
 had been dropped off and we were looking around a village and we had to then get back to the

350
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,240
 car that was picking us up at a certain time.

351
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,560
 It was a really, really hot day and part of getting back to the car involved walking up

352
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,680
 a very, very, very, very steep hill.

353
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,080
 It probably is about a 10 minute walk up.

354
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,120
 And as I say, it was very, very hot and it was also busy.

355
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,560
 There was a lot of people around.

356
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,760
 And I'm there with my son.

357
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,480
 My son is 16 and we're walking up on a time.

358
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,680
 We've got to get to the car.

359
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,360
 And I'm saying to myself, "Oh, I'm so hot, so hot.

360
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,280
 Come on, we've got to get there, got to get there."

361
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,680
 And in front of us, there is this grandma.

362
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,920
 She must have been like late 70s, early 80s.

363
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,320
 And she's pushing a push chair with a four-year-old in it.

364
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,640
 And she's like pushing it up the hill like this.

365
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,480
 And it's hot.

366
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,920
 And I'm looking at her thinking, "Oh, no.

367
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,440
 This must be really hard for her.

368
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,040
 She's got to push that child all the way up the hill."

369
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,360
 That's what I'm thinking.

370
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,360
 My son, my son is tall and strong.

371
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
 He walks in front.

372
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,600
 As he's walking, he looks.

373
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,120
 And with his hand, he grabs the front of the push chair.

374
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,120
 And he starts to pull the push chair up the hill.

375
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,760
 And the grandma is like, "Oh, thank you, thank you,

376
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,360
 thank you so much."

377
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,880
 And the toddler is so excited.

378
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,320
 And I watched my son and I thought, "Wow."

379
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,280
 I was in the same situation.

380
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:02,720
 And my response was, "Oh, that's going to be tough for her."

381
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,800
 My son's response was action.

382
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,560
 And afterwards, when I said to him, "How did you even

383
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,040
 think about doing that?"

384
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,440
 I was like, "I'm so proud of you."

385
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,880
 And he was like, "Hmm."

386
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,960
 And that is how we make a difference in Hong Kong,

387
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,920
 where we choose to see the people around us,

388
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,120
 and where we choose to act differently,

389
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:43,160
 where we choose to allow what God has done for us to propel us

390
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,480
 in many different small and large ways where we can make

391
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,640
 a difference.

392
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,800
 We all are known and loved by God.

393
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,960
 The sacrifice on the cross is evidence.

394
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,200
 It is evidence that God loves us all.

395
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,280
 The desire for him to be in relationship with us should

396
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:15,080
 propel us to love others as he asked us to do.

397
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:21,760
 So I leave you today with a very simple question and challenge.

398
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,360
 Who is on your doorstep, and what are you going to do

399
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,200
 for them?

400
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:37,200
 Would you stand with me as I pray for us?

401
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,520
 And as we enter into a time of response,

402
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,480
 the song "Chosen," I believe, is a prophetic word for us

403
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:52,760
 to sing because it talks about having God fill our hearts so

404
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,880
 that we will lead out of God's love

405
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,720
 and that we would see those around us

406
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:05,040
 and respond out of love to those around us.

407
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,760
 May this message not just be--

408
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,200
 well, that was a nice message, or not, whatever.

409
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,400
 May this message, with the power of the Holy Spirit,

410
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,640
 transform us as a church.

411
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,240
 May we, the vine, be known for our good deeds, our kindness,

412
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,040
 our generosity, not because it's a good thing to do,

413
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,080
 but because of the power of the Holy Spirit working through us.

414
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,640
 That transforms a city.

415
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,760
 So Father, as we stand here now, as we ask for your Spirit

416
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:54,800
 to empower us to live a life where we can bring change,

417
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,720
 where we can be countercultural at times,

418
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:05,640
 where we embrace the value system of the kingdom of God,

419
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,120
 I pray for the Lazaruses in this room

420
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:13,480
 right now who don't feel known, but they are known.

421
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,080
 And I speak that over you, are known.

422
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,240
 God knows your situation.

423
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,760
 He knows exactly what you need.

424
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,400
 And I pray that you would be filled

425
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,160
 with the comfort and the presence of the peace of God

426
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:33,640
 if you leave this place knowing that you are seen by God.

427
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,200
 I pray for our young people.

428
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,200
 I thank you that they are a witness to us.

429
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,200
 And I pray that you empower our young people

430
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,040
 to see the needs around them and to simply show and lead

431
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,720
 the way of what it means to love and care and be kind to others.

432
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,240
 May we learn from them.

433
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,200
 For us, Father, as we leave, as we

434
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,600
 look at who you have placed on the doorstep in front of us,

435
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:16,280
 may we not walk by, but may we take action.

436
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,680
 And may you break our heart for what breaks yours.

437
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,440
 We pray all of this in your name, Jesus.

438
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,000
 Amen.

439
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,580
 (gentle music)
