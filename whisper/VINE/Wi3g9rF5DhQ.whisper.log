[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Actually, church, before we really get started,
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.120]   Rebecca, please come back.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.400]   Everyone, this is Rebecca.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.960]   You've probably never actually seen her,
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.700]   but she's gonna put that microphone down and stop hiding.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.580]   She's gonna come and join me up front,
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.240]   which she has absolutely no idea what's happening,
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.560]   but it's okay.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.660]   Come on over, Rebecca.
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.660]   (audience applauds)
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.400]   This is Rebecca, her first,
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.980]   so I hired her a few years ago,
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.420]   and fun story, even though I hired her
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.600]   and I interviewed her and read her name,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.800]   I kept calling her Rachel,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.760]   and so people in this organization
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.200]   called her Rachel for a long time,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.840]   but her name is actually Rebecca.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.040]   I just thought it'd be good to bring Rebecca up here.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.560]   This is actually her last Sunday on staff with us.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.980]   Many of you don't know what Rebecca does,
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220]   but you wouldn't be able to hear anything
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.980]   if she wasn't here.
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.880]   She has been a part of our,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.800]   she's actually run our production team,
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.960]   her and Benjamin, but her focusing mostly on audio.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.860]   She was the brains behind helping us
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.540]   completely change our system.
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.000]   She's been helping us with our recording of,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.840]   did I just say that out loud?
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.760]   Recording of some songs for the church.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.040]   She's been doing quite a lot behind the scenes,
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.640]   and you never really get a chance to see her,
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.800]   so before she leaves,
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.580]   I just thought we could tell her thank you.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.420]   So if we could just give her a round of applause, everyone.
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.420]   (audience applauds)
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.720]   Because we do appreciate you,
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.120]   and we're super grateful for the years you've spent here,
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.620]   and if you will stretch out your hands,
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.120]   we're just gonna pray for Rebecca.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.440]   Jesus, we thank you for Rebecca,
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.240]   and for her life, for her being in this community.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.640]   We know she's not leaving the Vine.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.960]   She's staying here with us,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.200]   serving on team, being a part of our community,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.320]   but as she steps off staff and continues to
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.480]   use the gifts you've given her in other places,
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.720]   Holy Spirit, would you just be her guide?
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.880]   Would you be her help?
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.120]   Would you lead her?
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.840]   Would you be with her?
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.760]   Would you protect her?
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.800]   Would you help her discern?
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.360]   Give her guidance where she needs it?
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.300]   I pray that she will feel the support from this community.
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.900]   We love her, and we thank you that we had
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.940]   just such a great season with her,
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.920]   running all these things,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.500]   and being a good friend to all of us.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.420]   So bless what she goes into.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.540]   Give her faith and courage,
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.500]   and provide all that she needs,
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.340]   that she will make lots of money doing what she does.
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.660]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.500]   Amen?
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.420]   All right, amen.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.260]   Thank you, boss.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.060]   (audience applauds)
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.900]   All right.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.100]   Couldn't put that in the rundown, 'cause she would hide.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.020]   Great.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.080]   Well, everyone, I am going to tell you
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.720]   some things about me today that I'm gonna need you
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.320]   not to judge me on.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.800]   I've got lots to share with you
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.320]   about relationships and friendships.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.560]   So I'm gonna start off by telling you about me back in 2013.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.560]   Back in 2013, I was young, I was fit, I was stronger,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.320]   I looked good, my jawline was more chiseled.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.140]   You talked about this before.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.680]   I looked really nice back then.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.680]   I was full of faith, but I was also dead broke,
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.120]   and I came to Hong Kong in 2013 dead broke,
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.280]   with not really any money,
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.040]   but I came to Hong Kong with a confidence,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.300]   knowing that God had called me to come to Hong Kong.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.280]   I couldn't tell you why.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.080]   I don't know why I really believed this,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.840]   but I had prayed, and I was sure God wanted me in Hong Kong.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.700]   So I came to Hong Kong, but let me tell you,
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.320]   my time in Hong Kong was not without its set of challenges.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.840]   The first major challenge being,
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.200]   I'd never been to Hong Kong before.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.480]   So I moved here after never having ever stepped foot here.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.320]   Zoom out a little bit.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.520]   I moved here, I'd never been to Asia before.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.000]   All right, so you know, when you're 23,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.840]   you're bold and young.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.080]   I came out here anyways, and I'll have to be honest,
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.960]   again, please don't judge me,
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.280]   but my understanding of what I thought Hong Kong
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.980]   would be like, I couldn't tell you where it was on a map,
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.480]   but I expected sesame chicken,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.000]   I expected teriyaki chicken, I expected fortune cookies.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.800]   I had this very Panda Express on every corner mentality,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.020]   and I was severely disappointed,
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.880]   but Chasu Bao's are great, so it's all right.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.560]   It's made up for it.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.800]   But yeah, I had this perspective,
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.400]   and I will say, the one thing I take pride in
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.060]   is I'm not like all the other Americans.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.040]   I did know this one thing, that Hong Kong is not in Japan.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.460]   Okay, I knew that, I knew that.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.440]   When I was home this Christmas,
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.520]   all the people that were like, so how's Japan?
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.360]   How's Japanese?
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.300]   I'm like, oh my goodness.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.480]   So I knew that much, which is good.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.600]   I'm proud of it, it's a low bar, but I'm proud of it.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.400]   I know all I really knew about Hong Kong, this is honest,
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.680]   was the movie Rush Hour, Lee and Carter.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.040]   That is all I knew.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.440]   I knew nothing about this place,
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.300]   but I knew God wanted me here, so I came.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.760]   I moved over to Hong Kong, and let me just say,
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.560]   there were quite a few challenges, guys.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.320]   I moved here with 10,000 Hong Kong dollars in my account.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.760]   Now, this was only a few years ago, what, 2013?
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.920]   10, 12, 11 years ago, I can't count.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.660]   $10,000 did not get you very far in 2013.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.160]   I didn't realize this, 'cause being a young
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.560]   university student, I thought 10K was just enough
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.400]   to get me where I needed to go.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.600]   I get here, and 10K's not enough to get you a flat.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.320]   So let's just say I had some major challenges
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.840]   trying to figure out how do you stretch $10,000
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.320]   to lead you into the things of God.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.840]   I couldn't afford anything.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.320]   I couldn't afford groceries, I couldn't afford living.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.080]   I couldn't, like month to month was a proper challenge,
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.240]   and so I found myself in this position
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.240]   where on one hand, I knew, I had prayed,
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.040]   I had felt that God had called me to move here
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.720]   for some very particular reasons.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.580]   I stood on that conviction, I knew I needed to be here.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.200]   On the other hand, that $10,000,
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.960]   that wasn't gonna get me very far,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.560]   and I found myself in that position of wrestling
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.080]   when you don't really know what do you do
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.320]   when God calls you into something,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.080]   but the challenges are overwhelming.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.960]   You find yourself convicted
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.720]   that you know where you're supposed to go.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.820]   God has called you to move forward,
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.720]   but what do you do when the resources aren't there?
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.880]   If you, anything like me, you've been in that place
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.680]   where you felt that tension before,
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.040]   where your conviction and your resources don't line up,
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.800]   where your conviction and the things that you need
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.600]   just aren't really harmonious.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.000]   This was me back in 2013.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.520]   I knew God wanted me here.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.720]   I was convinced of it.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.740]   No one could tell me any different,
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.280]   but I also didn't know how I was supposed to follow God
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.080]   into a city I'd never been into before,
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.200]   into the unknown, really confused,
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.900]   really flustered, overwhelmed.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.240]   I think I look back at that time
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.160]   and I recognize I had the right start.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.160]   I made the right choices.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.880]   I wore the right clothes,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.200]   but if we have three of these things
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.960]   and we're missing one very critical, important aspect,
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.440]   I think we can oftentimes start in the direction
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.220]   that God wants us to go,
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.960]   but we will find it ridiculously challenging
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.620]   to remain there.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.040]   Perhaps God is calling us to consider
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.720]   if we have the right people with us.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.280]   See, we've been in the story of David so far
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.920]   in 1 Samuel, and we've seen
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.120]   that David's calling is incredible.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.800]   He's been anointed to be the next king of Israel.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.040]   He'd be the second king,
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.760]   and it wasn't because of his looks.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.840]   He wasn't particularly tall or strong
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.480]   or anything on the outside
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.720]   that would give you this understanding
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.680]   that he should be king,
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.520]   but he'd been anointed
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.560]   because of his heart's posture towards God.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.960]   So things are going pretty good for him.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.600]   He goes into Saul's court,
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.960]   and not expecting to,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.400]   he's now given the job of playing the harp
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.720]   and the lyre to help calm down King Saul, right?
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.960]   And when he would play his harp and his lyre,
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.280]   there would be a soothing that would happen to Saul,
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.880]   and even though he was possessed
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.380]   and haunted by these evil spirits,
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.220]   it would soothe him,
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.320]   so David finds himself soothing the king,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.320]   and while he's doing his regular responsibilities,
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.320]   a season arises where a man by the name of Goliath
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.720]   is threatening the people of God,
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.480]   and nobody from the army,
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.920]   nobody feels that they have the courage to stand up.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.180]   I mean, these are God's people,
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.160]   but no one has the strength
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.600]   and the ability to say, "I'll take him on."
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.440]   And what does David do?
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.280]   David steps up.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.440]   He decides he will go and fight Goliath,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.120]   and he's given this great honor where Saul's like,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.600]   "Here, well, if you're gonna fight Goliath,
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.960]   "if you're gonna stand in front of the people,
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.360]   "here, wear my stuff,"
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.720]   and David rejects that, takes it off,
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.800]   and he stays dressed in the expectations of God.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.320]   If you were here last week, that would make sense to you.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.400]   We get the fact that Saul ends up loving David
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.480]   for what he's doing at that time.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.680]   David's life isn't too bad.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.480]   You're anointed to be king, and things are going well.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.320]   He fights Goliath, and he wins against all odds, right?
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.300]   So, so far, he's starting off pretty well,
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.440]   but as he's about to find out, this is not enough.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.960]   He's been authentically himself.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.420]   He's been doing things the right way,
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.680]   making the right choices,
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.440]   but this wouldn't be enough to sustain him
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.960]   in what was to come next, right?
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.200]   He would realize that he would need the right people
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.900]   being their authentic self around him
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.360]   in order to continue going down the path
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.800]   that God had for him, and it's as we think about this,
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.680]   we reach a new character in the story,
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.200]   Jonathan, Saul's son.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.540]   So I'm gonna take us here to 1 Samuel 18,
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.760]   verses one through four.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.600]   It's on the screen.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.480]   You can read with me.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.120]   After David finished talking with Saul,
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.200]   Jonathan became one in spirit with David,
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.320]   and he loved him as himself.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.880]   From that day, Saul kept David with him
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.400]   and did not let him return home to his family.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.840]   Jonathan made a covenant with David
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.160]   because he loved him as himself.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.080]   Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.040]   and gave it to David, along with his tunic
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.780]   and even his sword, his bow, and his belt.
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.860]   So what's happening here?
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.640]   Why are we given this story?
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.680]   David has just come off of this mountaintop experience
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.560]   of defeating Goliath and destroying the Philistine army,
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.040]   cutting off the head of this giant
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.560]   and baking Israel in a place where it's victorious
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.040]   and no longer in danger again,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.620]   and we get this random story of David
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.740]   and this relationship that Jonathan has.
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.700]   David has impressed the king, starts off saying,
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.080]   Saul is like, who is this kid?
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.160]   Like, how does he go from being a shepherd boy
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.220]   to now fighting a giant and winning for the whole nation?
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.560]   Who is his father?
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.400]   What family?
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.440]   He is impressed.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.880]   Something about David, everything about David
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.960]   has now caught his eye,
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.080]   and it's also caught the eye of his son, Jonathan,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.360]   who is like, wow, what is this guy?
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.760]   And he ends up committing himself to David.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.600]   He ends up befriending David.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.060]   It says that David is now gonna be stuck with Saul
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.900]   for a while.
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.040]   He's not allowed to go back home.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.840]   So I reckon David was probably glad
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.880]   someone probably around his age
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.540]   to be his friend in that space.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.720]   I'm pretty sure that was a bit of a relief for him.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.000]   But here, David has two options.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.480]   In front of him lies two people.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.880]   There's Saul and there's Jonathan.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:09.600]   And it's not so easy to recognize who is who
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.400]   when it comes to who are the right people
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.600]   to have with you as you move into the things of God.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.080]   And so what we're gonna do is we're gonna evaluate
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.080]   both Saul and Jonathan and see how some words are similar,
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.500]   some actions are similar,
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.260]   but actually only one of these guys
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.620]   is the right type of people for David
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.740]   to be able to move into the things of God.
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.180]   Are you guys with me?
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.340]   All right, let's look at this.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.220]   Saul, the first thing we know about Saul
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.260]   is it tells us that the spirit of God had left Saul.
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.720]   Now, you don't have to be a biblical scholar
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.060]   to recognize that in your setting,
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.060]   if the spirit of God has left somebody,
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.300]   pro tip, they're probably not the right person.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.140]   All right?
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:50.960]   If the spirit of God,
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.380]   it said that because of his disobedience to God,
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.260]   the spirit of God had left him in what?
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.940]   An unclean spirit, an evil spirit,
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.180]   a demonic spirit had entered him.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.820]   This should be our first indicator
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.140]   without us having to be scholars
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.780]   to recognize something's off about Saul.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.580]   But I think for David,
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.620]   it probably wasn't that easy to recognize.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.220]   So for us, we're reading it back
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.700]   and we're getting the narration.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.940]   For David actually tells us that Saul loved David.
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.720]   So David's in this position to discern this man loves him.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.620]   I mean, think about what he did last week, right?
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.720]   So he offers him his kingly gear, his armor,
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.860]   to be the best, to have the best stuff,
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.660]   to look the best part in order to fight Goliath.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.660]   From the naked eye, it looks like Saul is for David, right?
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.060]   Those seem like good things,
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.520]   but think about how in order for Saul
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.780]   to even do this, give David his stuff,
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.060]   he first has to be abdicating his responsibility as king,
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.340]   because it's the king's job to defend his people.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.100]   He is hiding.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.860]   He's not actually living as God has called him to live,
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.560]   fulfilling the responsibilities.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.700]   And so even though he's offering this good stuff
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.140]   done from the wrong place, it's rejected by God, right?
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.740]   And so David is able to put those things down
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.980]   and not take it with him.
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:17.260]   Although Saul gives him this great honor,
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.740]   his motives are unpure,
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.180]   and so God does not find it acceptable.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.860]   Let's look at Jonathan.
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.580]   We only get four verses to really get an idea
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.420]   of who Jonathan is.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.440]   We don't get much of a backstory before that,
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.520]   but what we see about Jonathan
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.140]   is we learn about his love for David.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.160]   That's the first thing we get.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.240]   Two times across these three verses,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.460]   we hear that Jonathan loved David.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.900]   See, the right people are committed in love, right?
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.740]   So think about this.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.380]   It says it two times, and I think for us,
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.880]   as we read scripture in our basic discipleship,
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.200]   something we should keep in mind,
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.980]   when we are reading the scripture,
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.500]   and a phrase or a word reappears multiple times,
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.180]   the biblical author is intending for us
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.580]   to catch on to something.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.020]   He's emphasizing something.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:05.980]   And so we have to ask ourselves,
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.620]   what is he actually saying?
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.580]   Slow down and read the text here.
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.940]   He's showing us the posture,
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.540]   the true posture of Jonathan's heart towards David.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.180]   Because again, Saul loved David.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.700]   Says it once, and we see that things were not right,
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.700]   but we get a repeat here that Jonathan loved David, twice.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.380]   Now, I think it's something we have to ask ourselves.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.380]   This is pretty interesting.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.580]   When I thought about it,
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.220]   if you're the king's son, if you're Jonathan,
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.380]   and your dad brings home this other kid,
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.420]   or young adult, however old they were,
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.860]   brings them home, and him doing his job so well,
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.900]   it soothes your dad's soul,
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.340]   probably like, "Whoa, what's going on?"
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.740]   And then he stands up and he defeats
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.160]   the biggest threat to your nation,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.380]   representing God even greater than the king does.
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.700]   You're probably like, "Whoa, what's going on?"
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.900]   Now he's gonna be stuck in your house, in the king's court.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.660]   I think for many people,
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.740]   the legitimate question would be,
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.380]   "Is this dude trying to take my place?"
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.580]   Right, that's a fair thing.
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.380]   That's a logical sequence to take, right?
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.720]   If someone is showing up doing all the right things,
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.220]   kind of in your space,
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.660]   jealousy would be the natural response.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.460]   I'm not sure of too many people that would say,
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.360]   "Yeah, let me align myself to this person.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.760]   "Let me love them like I love myself.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.540]   "Let me value them first, let me prioritize."
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.020]   That is not the natural response,
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.900]   so this is what we find in Jonathan towards David.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.600]   Most of us would have a hard time loving a potential threat.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.100]   I mean, just think about Instagram.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.940]   Most of us, we go on social media
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.660]   and we see that people have all these things that we want,
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.460]   things that we desire, and it's not really love.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.920]   I mean, we press the heart button,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.680]   but it's not really love that we feel towards them, is it?
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.740]   A lot of times, when people are doing well,
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.300]   our natural tendency is jealousy.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.500]   But I think we learn something here from Jonathan,
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.180]   that we're called to love.
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.400]   His love for David was as he loved himself.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.340]   I think if we're not careful in our jealousy,
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:21.260]   in our natural predisposition, we end up envying others.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.280]   We end up jealous of others.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.420]   We end up coveting our neighbor
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.700]   instead of loving them like we love ourselves.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.940]   But Jonathan loves David.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:30.780]   That's what we get.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.820]   The scripture tells us again and again,
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.580]   Jonathan loved David as much as himself.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.580]   So when I looked at this, I immediately thought about
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.820]   where else does this take place?
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.640]   And this is a good practice for all of us.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.180]   When you read something like that that's repeated,
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.780]   again, yes, you're meant to focus on those phrases,
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.300]   but that phrase, as much as he loved himself,
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.140]   where else does this also show up in scripture?
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.740]   Right, I went straight to Matthew chapter 22.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.460]   Matthew chapter 22 is a great passage
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.180]   because Jesus is standing there
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.340]   and one of the top teachers of the law approaches Jesus
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.740]   with the desire to test and trap him.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.820]   And he says, "Jesus, good teacher,
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.960]   "of all the commandments that are out there,
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.380]   "which is the greatest one?
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.200]   "Which is the best?
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.580]   "Of all the commandments of Moses,
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.680]   "which is the best one for us to follow?"
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.740]   Jesus looks in the eye and goes,
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.220]   "You shall love your God with all your heart,
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.180]   "with all your mind, with all your soul,
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.780]   "with all your strength."
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.320]   And I'm sure dude was like, "Okay, good job.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.620]   "No blasphemy there, check."
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.740]   Then Jesus goes, "And,"
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.240]   which I'm sure is through everybody else off
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.740]   because a question like that, which is the greatest,
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.500]   is meant to come with only one answer.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.800]   Jesus says, "Love the Lord your God
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.100]   "with all your heart, soul, mind, strength, and,"
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.620]   he adds an extra thing and I'm sure they're all like,
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.280]   "What is he about to say?
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.620]   "What else can there be?
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.380]   "Loving God must be the only thing.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.620]   "It must be the top thing."
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.060]   Jesus says, "And love your neighbor,"
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.960]   what's the phrase?
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   "As you love yourself, as much as you love yourself."
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.600]   Jesus would say that all of the laws of God
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.640]   hinge on these two things.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.240]   If you love God with all your heart, holy,
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.280]   and you love your neighbor as yourself,
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.760]   love your brother as yourself,
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.720]   love those around you as you love yourself.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.480]   First John would tell us that if you don't love others,
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.520]   the love of God is not in you.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.480]   It's a bit of a harsh way of putting it.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.840]   But this is Jonathan's love, right?
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   That term, as he loved himself.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.800]   This is the way that Jonathan loved David.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.680]   It's a costly love because it puts him in this position
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.080]   where he values David the same, if not more, than himself,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.040]   which is a bit unnatural, right?
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.040]   Like who loves other people more than they love themselves?
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.520]   No, Jonathan's love for David
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.680]   was that greatest commandment kind of love.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.320]   And all of our examples of love in scripture
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.600]   is this others-centered love.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.560]   It's caring for those around us.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.040]   It's giving our lives on behalf of others around us.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.840]   And it's great because Jesus says this
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.200]   thousands of years later,
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.320]   but David and Jonathan are living this out way beforehand.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.800]   So we're meant to kind of see that bit of a hyperlink
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.760]   between the two concepts, others-centered love.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.680]   And I think when we see this,
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.320]   we should be asking ourselves, of those in our community,
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.480]   if we are asking, who's the right people?
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.560]   I'm torn between this and this.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.360]   Is there others-centered love visible?
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.200]   Because that's actually meant to be
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.520]   what marks us as disciples.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.160]   It's meant to be a key characteristic
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.200]   of anyone who chooses to follow God,
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.800]   that yes, they would love God wholly,
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.000]   but also they would love their neighbor as theirselves.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.440]   See, the right people are committed to this kind of love.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.960]   And the thing is that this kind of love
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.280]   is not a result of trying really hard.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.960]   It's not a result of, oh, it's Jethro and me.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.240]   That's great, that's the right kind of love right there.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.240]   This kind of love is not a result of trying hard.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.800]   It's not a byproduct of just mustering up
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.440]   all your strength and energy.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.840]   No, if we actually go back to what we see in Matthew 22,
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.440]   there is an order.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.440]   Jesus says, first, you love God with all that you have.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.520]   And from that flows the ability
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.680]   to love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.960]   He doesn't say love your neighbor as yourself
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.320]   and then try and love God.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.000]   He also doesn't say just love God.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.200]   He gives us this command that we must first love God.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.640]   See, the people in your life cannot truly love you
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.960]   as much as they love themselves if they don't love God.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.520]   It's impossible.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.560]   So what we need in our lives when it comes to community
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.320]   aren't just people with the same hobbies as us,
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.960]   as much as that's good.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.560]   What we need in our lives are not just people
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.320]   who work in the same field as us
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.000]   or who are same-mindedness or same ideology as us.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.640]   No, we need people who choose to love God wholeheartedly
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.400]   because it's only from that place
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.240]   of wholehearted love to God
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.120]   can you have the ability to love others
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.720]   as you love yourself.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.000]   This is the mark of a true disciple of Christ.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.400]   This is what we're all aiming to be like,
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.640]   to love God with all that we have,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.880]   all our heart, with all our soul,
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.440]   with all our mind, with all our strength.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.920]   And if we're going to walk into this year
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.320]   that God has set for us,
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.560]   we need people who are gonna walk with us,
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.920]   who carry this characteristic of love for God
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.360]   before everything, which naturally flows
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.320]   into love for others.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.080]   In the next couple of verses,
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.400]   we see more similarity between Jonathan and Saul.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.600]   This time it's not just in their actions
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.920]   or in their words of love, it's in what they do.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.280]   So I'm gonna read for us 1 Samuel 18, four, says this,
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.000]   "And Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.880]   "and gave it to David, along with his tunic
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.400]   "and even his sword, his bow, and his belt."
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.520]   If you were here last week,
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.120]   you've been tracking with us through this series.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.600]   Last week was all about the clothes, right?
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.880]   Pastor Andrew wore like the oversized jacket
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.960]   that was terrible on him, the one that kind of fit.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.440]   It was all about what you wear.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.680]   And his whole idea is, Pastor Andrew was showing us
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.120]   how Saul had offered David his stuff.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.240]   He had done almost the exact same thing.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.960]   He had taken his clothes and put it on David.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.440]   And Jonathan is doing the same thing.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.040]   The biblical author was trying to get us to think,
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.840]   to see the connection, right?
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.200]   You've got Saul who did this, you've got Jonathan
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.600]   who did the exact same thing,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.040]   yet what's implied are two different results.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   For Saul, he's dodging responsibility, right?
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.520]   Because Goliath is still ahead of them.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.920]   He gives him his armor before he goes to fight Goliath.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.040]   But think about when the Jonathan story occurs.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.680]   This is after the battle.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.920]   What is the purpose of giving someone all this stuff
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.880]   after the battle?
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.240]   He doesn't have another giant to go and fight yet.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.760]   He's actually, everything is good.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.800]   Everyone's pleased with him.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.040]   We're all celebrating that.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.360]   The Philistines are no longer threatening our existence.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.480]   Our nation will live.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.320]   We are okay.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.520]   We're not made their slaves.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.360]   Everything is good.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.040]   So why would Jonathan start giving him this stuff?
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.080]   What would be the purpose?
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.880]   It's very different from what Saul was doing.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.760]   So I'm gonna actually read this to you
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.360]   'cause as I looked through this,
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.960]   I found very deep perspective that is not my own idea,
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.600]   but it's something for us to consider,
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.880]   and it really helps us understand what's happening.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.640]   So just play as close attention as you can.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.280]   Scholars would say that the word used here for robe
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.000]   often denotes a royal robe.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.880]   Ancient Near East texts would speak of this special robe
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.240]   as the robe worn by the crown prince.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.000]   So if Israel had the same planned customs as other nations,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.080]   that would mean Jonathan would have been renouncing
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.320]   his claim to the throne by giving David that robe.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.880]   This represents, or this along with the bow
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.040]   and daily garments given from Jonathan
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.560]   may very well represent his willingness to give up
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.800]   and transfer his particular position
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.080]   as heir apparent to the throne of Israel.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.680]   He was thus expressing loyalty
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.760]   and possibly submission to David.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.840]   So, sit on that for a minute.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:22.120]   Jonathan, simplify this concept.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.160]   Jonathan is offering David a sacrificial friendship,
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.960]   one that's not characterized by competition,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.160]   one that's not characterized by just seeing
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.600]   what's on the outside or by insecurity.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.840]   It's characterized by sacrifice,
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.560]   one where the other person lays down
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.760]   the essence of their life.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.440]   We know that scripture says,
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.800]   "Greater love has no one than the one
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.920]   "who lays down their life for a friend."
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.200]   Yes, that's talking about physical life and death,
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.720]   but I would ask how much greater is it
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.200]   when your life leads to the throne,
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.160]   to the highest position in the land,
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.720]   to give up your actual destiny,
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.000]   to give up the thing that's probably
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.600]   the most desirable thing in your nation,
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.880]   to give up the top spot.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.480]   I mean, he was gonna be king.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.400]   The second king of the nation.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.600]   This is where you wanna be.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.080]   This is the position you wanna be able to inherit.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:22.080]   And he is willingly, sacrificially laying that down
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.200]   in order to display sacrificial friendship.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   See, because Jonathan loved David the right way,
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.240]   his actions are gonna support David.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.880]   Those who are committed to Christ-like love
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.400]   are committed in Christ-like actions.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:47.960]   Had his love been for himself,
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.920]   Jonathan could have done lots of other things
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.480]   and not laid down his crown.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.520]   Had his love been for himself,
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.440]   Jonathan would have tried to self-preserve.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.040]   But from his action, we can clearly see
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.120]   that he truly is living in a sacrificial relationship
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.480]   where his love looks a lot like the love of Christ
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   that we see.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.240]   I mean, I find it wild
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.480]   because this isn't normally how the world works.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.080]   Imagine with me, just for a minute,
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.120]   pretend that we lived in a world
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.600]   where this is how people treated one another.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.240]   Imagine if your friends were friends with you,
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.320]   not just because you benefited them,
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.800]   or only friends with you until you had disagreement.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.920]   Imagine if people came into your life
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.120]   to support you fully in godliness.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.520]   Imagine if the community around you
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.120]   had no self-interest in mind,
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.360]   if they were willing to give up everything,
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.800]   not so that David could have like, be cool and be king,
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   but so that David could walk into following God,
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.480]   into what God had for him.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.400]   Imagine a world or a community,
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.040]   and I guess to an extent,
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.000]   I'm not chewing us out,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.320]   but I guess to an extent it's sad
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.400]   because that's actually meant to be
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.000]   the community that we live in.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.240]   This is meant to mark the church.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.360]   This is meant to be how we live with one another.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.400]   Relationships like this, where it's not about me,
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.040]   where it's not about my self-interest,
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.920]   but I care enough about the person next to me
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.240]   to do whatever I can
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:31.080]   to help them walk into the things of God,
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.960]   into godliness.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.640]   Not harboring jealousy
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.120]   because maybe they got the promotion and I didn't.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.520]   Not being mad because they can afford a good holiday
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.720]   and I can't,
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.240]   or they have the perfect relationship,
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.600]   or the perfect house, or the perfect car,
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.640]   or the, they have, whatever it is.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.480]   Not just living by sight,
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.400]   but truly discerning,
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.000]   living by the Spirit,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.360]   and actually cooperating,
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.160]   working alongside the things
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.480]   that God is doing in the life.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.880]   In the lives of others.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.280]   That is actually the purpose for community.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.720]   That is why we exist.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.120]   Man, these kinds of people will definitely
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.800]   make you feel good about yourself.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.120]   But beyond that, they will help you
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.960]   walk into the things of God.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.560]   They encourage and they will support.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.600]   They are present, they are active,
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.640]   and they are intentionally engaged
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.360]   in helping you reach the things of God.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.560]   And what Jonathan does here is not just symbolic.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.160]   Yes, he takes off these garments
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.920]   and passes it to David,
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.880]   but it's actually followed up with some action.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.120]   If you look at the next three chapters
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.840]   from 19, 20, and 21 of 1 Samuel,
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.320]   you will see in the narrative
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.240]   that David goes from everything's not that bad,
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.560]   to running for his life,
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.120]   to fleeing, to hiding.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.040]   There's a certain point where he's in a cave
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.680]   while still waiting for the promises of God.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.680]   He is running, he is desperate.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.960]   He is almost an outlaw in the kingdom
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.200]   that he's been promised.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   And you recognize that it's at that point
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.880]   that God had done something incredible.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.920]   The very thing David needed to be able to sustain
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.800]   in the promises of God
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.600]   was not just found in his good heart.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:16.520]   It would be found in this relationship.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.920]   See, what Jonathan would do is remarkable.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.480]   He would lie to his father,
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.960]   to the king who had the right to kill him,
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.080]   but also to his father, his father, right?
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.440]   He would lie to him, he would deceive him,
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.120]   he would go against the king of the nation
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.160]   in order to help David.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.120]   There's one point I thought was very interesting.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.480]   It said that when this evil spirit would possess Saul,
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.760]   there was one point where Jonathan made him so mad
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.360]   in trying to save and protect David
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.360]   that Saul lunged a sphere at him
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.200]   to try and kill him, it said with the intent to kill him.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.840]   So it wasn't just a symbolic,
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.200]   okay, yes, you can become king and I'm gonna support you.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.360]   Dude backed it up with the way he lived.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.040]   He put himself, he put his life on the line
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.720]   to help this man walk into the things of God.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.560]   Y'all, that is unreal friendship.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.600]   That is sacrificial friendship,
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.200]   sabotaging your dad's plans.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.240]   Now, I obviously, I come from the US
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.840]   and the culture I come from
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.000]   has a very individualistic society.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.960]   And so whenever I read through this,
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.000]   you know, growing up or over the years,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.200]   it never really stuck out to me,
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.160]   but I had a greater appreciation reading this
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.640]   after being in Hong Kong for the past 11 years
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.280]   because in this culture, we value family a lot.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.880]   We operate as a unit, right?
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.120]   And the idea of going against your family
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.240]   is not something you just gloss over
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.920]   and get to the fun part of the scripture.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.280]   That makes you halt and you steps, right?
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.640]   The idea of sabotaging your family
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.360]   in order to help the things of God in another place,
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.400]   that's wild, especially here.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.080]   Push it even further, the idea of going against your father,
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.520]   that definitely brings some sort of tension.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.160]   So much so, because again, I've not grown up in Hong Kong.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.400]   So I talked to someone who did,
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.520]   the girl who did these slides, her name is Veronica,
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.840]   and I was asking her about what does it make you feel
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.360]   when you zoom in on the idea
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:25.080]   that Jonathan had to resist, shrug off,
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.080]   lie to, lose, push back, disagree with his father?
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.320]   How does that make you feel in your context,
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.480]   even your story, even your life?
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.960]   And she was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's tension,
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.200]   it's all those things, it feels awkward.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.720]   And it's like, oh, I could never do that.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.680]   But what was even greater was the next day,
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.280]   came back to work and she was like,
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.000]   dude, thinking about that, I had dreams about it last night.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.920]   It caused me that much distress
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.520]   just thinking about what that would mean,
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.720]   that it seeped into my dreams last night.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.640]   Like this is the level of sacrificial friendship.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.000]   Like I give you that example to show you
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.360]   just how sacrificial of a friendship
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.400]   Jonathan had with David.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:13.520]   And even greater, David is this man of God,
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.720]   David is doing all the things right.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.640]   And I feel like maybe it's something
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.520]   we need to specifically keep in mind.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.480]   He's able to slay giants,
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.560]   he's able to be anointed as king,
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.080]   he's able to soothe Saul's soul.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:34.880]   But in order for him to properly
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.640]   step into what God has for him,
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.760]   the destiny and the promises of God,
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:46.320]   even with God's help, he needs a friend.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.880]   Think about that.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.400]   Even with God by himself, David needed a godly community.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.520]   He needed a true spiritual friendship.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.080]   He needed sacrificial people who were in his life
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.760]   willing to help him follow and go where God was leading.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.600]   I think for you and I,
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.680]   we're not that much different from David.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.280]   We also have obstacles in where God is calling us to be.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.840]   The things that God has for you this year,
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.280]   where he's hoping to develop and grow you,
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.920]   there will be things that prevent us from that.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.520]   And having the right people are critical.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.560]   And every time I preach on community here,
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.320]   I recognize that it's a bit of like a preaching
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.040]   to the choir, because I think in theory,
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.440]   we all recognize community is good, right?
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.000]   No one's like, "Boo, community, we hate it."
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.960]   No, especially not with Pastor Jennifer,
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.000]   our community group pastor here.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.440]   We definitely don't say that.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.640]   But there is this basic temptation
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.600]   that we do have to resist.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:50.520]   There is this passive pattern that we step into
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.760]   where yes, we know this is important,
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.360]   yet we unfortunately believe
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:02.360]   and live out the lie that we can do it on our own,
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.480]   or that we actually don't need others.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.760]   It's a passive belief.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.440]   I don't think most of us are trying to cut people out.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.480]   It's not an active belief,
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.320]   but the consequences are still as dangerous.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:20.160]   We are tempted to not recognize that we genuinely need.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.120]   It's not really an option.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.440]   We genuinely need the right people.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.280]   We're tempted to think that
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.160]   if we just make the right choices,
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.880]   if we just start the right way,
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.280]   if we just wear the right clothes, we'll be okay.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.080]   But our biggest help is ignored
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.640]   when we don't realize that we desperately
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.800]   also need the right people.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   But here's the thing, God knows.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.720]   He knows that you need support to keep your faith strong.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.120]   He knows that when things get hard,
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.200]   you need help to be emboldened
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.800]   to withstand whatever obstacles are in front of you.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.720]   He knows that you need strengthening
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.440]   in the days and the weeks ahead
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.480]   to resist the insecurities
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.960]   and to resist spiraling into fear.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.360]   My question is this,
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.480]   what if God is saying that the very thing you need
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.360]   is only gonna be found as a byproduct
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.000]   of investing in relationships with the right people?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.960]   What if that's the only option?
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.160]   What if that's his only way?
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.200]   It's not like a plan A, plan B.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.600]   What if that's the only plan?
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.800]   What if this is God's way of actually providing
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.360]   the help that we need?
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.880]   I mean, that's certainly what he did with David.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.480]   We can find ourselves thinking
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.160]   that we need to pray the right prayer,
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.920]   attend the right amount of services,
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.240]   join the right teams, read the right passages in Scripture,
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.200]   go to the right self-help person,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.440]   do all the right things, wear the right clothes,
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.000]   have the right belief system, attend the right classes,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   and God is saying, "Stop praying the right prayer.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.600]   "I've given you the right people."
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.560]   Like, this is our biggest help,
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.200]   and he's provided so many of us.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.480]   I mean, just look to your left and your right.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.240]   When I speak of the right people,
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.200]   you guys are it, right?
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.400]   Also, you guys as well, not just this time.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.760]   Perhaps that's the reality.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.960]   God has designed it this way.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.920]   He's designed it intentionally to be this way.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.200]   And perhaps the things of God
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.680]   are not actually meant to be attained in isolation
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.440]   because the things of God are not just for us.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.320]   Maybe that's why he won't let you do it by yourself.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.760]   Maybe that's why he wouldn't just let David
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.960]   get to where he needed to go by himself.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.080]   See, David's kingship was not just for David.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.520]   You could even argue it was never for David
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.200]   in the first place.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.040]   It was God's way of leading his people,
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.160]   God's way of being present with his people.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.400]   The king served a role, all right?
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.240]   So the thing that you're being led towards
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.680]   isn't just for you.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.480]   When we try and do it on our own,
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:06.080]   we end up super susceptible to that faulty thinking.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.960]   We tend to think that the end-all, be-all
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.200]   is receiving whatever God has for me
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.520]   in this year of action.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.240]   We end up worshiping a me-centric God.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.840]   But what if the purpose God has for you
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.200]   is only accomplished with the right people
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.000]   because the purposes are for the benefit of all people?
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.080]   God's purpose, the whole Bible is this beautiful picture
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:33.520]   of God redeeming and reconciling all creation
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.920]   back to himself.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.560]   That is the whole book right there.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.640]   That is what we're aiming for.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.280]   That is what he's doing.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.760]   So we need the right people
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.120]   to help us follow Christ correctly,
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.320]   knowing that whatever God has in store for you
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.240]   and for you this year, whatever new thing you start,
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.640]   whatever year of action, however it manifests itself,
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.680]   it's not just for you.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.280]   Having the right people helps us recognize
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.680]   that it's actually all connected to God's heart
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.280]   and his plan to redeem and reconcile
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.320]   all things back to himself.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:09.120]   Guys, apart from these kinds of relationships there,
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.600]   I don't know another way that you can actually stay
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.440]   where God's sending you.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.360]   So if you wanna start, well, do the first three things.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.960]   Make good choices, wear the right clothes,
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.720]   have the right start.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.880]   I think most of us aren't interested
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.600]   in just starting the things of God.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.480]   Most of us are interested in abiding and remaining
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.360]   and being steadfast in the things of God,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.520]   continuing the good faith journey.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:42.320]   And I really don't want us to miss out on the true gift,
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.280]   the true gift that friendship is.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.240]   Like David and Jonathan's story,
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.280]   I was, this morning we were praying
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.160]   before the 9/15 service.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.120]   One of our staff, Gordon, was praying.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.480]   He was like, "Jesus, thank you," all this stuff,
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.480]   for Pastor Promise and for just this unique story
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.080]   of friendship, and it hit me
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.600]   because it's actually not meant to be unique.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.440]   It's actually meant to be pretty common.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.960]   It's meant to be the way that we naturally operate,
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.520]   the way that we naturally live being there for one another.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.880]   So I started off this whole sermon, this whole talk,
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.840]   telling you about all my faulty things
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.120]   and coming to Hong Kong with only 10K in my pocket
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.080]   and looking for Panda Express on every corner
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.120]   and being very sad.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.360]   I wanna tell you how it ended.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.000]   So I get here, and again, I don't have praying hard enough
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.440]   didn't make rents become super, super, super affordable
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.440]   or free, but what ended up happening was ridiculous.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.680]   This is true.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.620]   We prayed for a free flat.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.240]   So me, my best friend Rick, my other best friend, Irem.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.840]   Rick used to serve here on the worship team.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.240]   Irem used to be one of our designers at the Vine
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.320]   before they both moved to the States a few years back.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.960]   And we prayed, we're like, "God, give us a free flat."
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.240]   Now, those kind of prayers are a lot easier
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.480]   when you're 23 years old.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.760]   I realized I must not have that kind of faith anymore,
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.760]   but we prayed for that.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.040]   And here's what happened.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.140]   God did not give us a free flat.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.240]   There you go.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.320]   No, what he did was a lady in the church
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.460]   offered to give us her flat for one US dollar a year.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:19.040]   Y'all, I know, that was me.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.760]   I was like, "Wait, this stuff happens?"
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.640]   I genuinely couldn't believe it.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.640]   But here's the thing.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.060]   Here's the kicker.
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:30.280]   She gave the flat to Rick and Irem, not to me,
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.000]   'cause I didn't work at that church.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.960]   So here I am, my needs haven't been met yet,
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.580]   but I know God wants me in Hong Kong,
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.780]   but how am I gonna live?
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:42.080]   Like, how am I supposed to, like, where do I go?
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.080]   And if I had not had these relationships
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.720]   with Rick and Irem, people who weren't just interested
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.360]   in me hanging out in Hong Kong,
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.280]   but who prayed and discerned with me,
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.040]   who were like iron sharpening me to do the things of God,
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.220]   I would have not had the blessings
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.380]   that came through being friends with them.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.080]   So I was able to live with them, slept on the couch.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.220]   But it worked, it was good, we were okay.
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.220]   These guys monthly would be a part of my support system.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.580]   They were interns, so remember, not much money, right?
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.020]   And church interns, so like very little money.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.660]   Just put it out there, put it out there.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.000]   But they were giving every single month
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.960]   to help make sure that I could live each minute.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.900]   There were countless, y'all, there were,
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.980]   like I think about it, and there's countless of examples
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.220]   of different people, the right people,
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.220]   people who were spiritually helping me,
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.100]   but were also financially helping me,
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.980]   who had no obligation to me,
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.600]   who had no reason to support me.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.420]   I think I've shared with you about how I got money
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.660]   to be able to propose to my wife
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.460]   because some dude just gave, like, God just provided,
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.820]   but he didn't just provide the thing,
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.020]   he provided the people, right?
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.660]   I remember when we first got here,
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.100]   one of the, yes, those are the big blessings that happened,
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.240]   but some of the practical things, like, you know,
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.500]   where's Jollibee?
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.540]   That was big.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.340]   My mate showed me where Jollibee was.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.540]   I learned that maybe I can't get sesame chicken,
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.300]   but char siu bao is the next best thing, right?
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.540]   Quality stuff.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.720]   I didn't know how to get off of the bus,
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.820]   off of a minibus, and I was, y'all,
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.180]   I was terrified waiting for the bus driver, right?
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.260]   Like, I'd sit there, my hands would get sweaty,
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.820]   I'd be practicing over and over,
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.380]   "Oh, I'm about to see someone going, I'm about to see someone,"
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.100]   and just be like, "Am I gonna say it this time?"
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.180]   And he'd go past my stop, I'm like,
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.780]   "I'll just wait until someone else says it,
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.900]   "and I'll walk back an extra two kilometers."
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.240]   But my friends were the ones that taught me,
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.760]   and showed me, and helped me actually
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.860]   be sustained in this city.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.880]   Those are silly examples, but they're practical.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.120]   They're everyday things, and the people that God has
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.160]   in your life, they're not just here for the big miracles.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.640]   It's also here for the everyday, small things,
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.820]   the simple things.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:45.300]   And I share that because I want that for us.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:50.480]   I don't want us starting in the way of God
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.480]   not being able to finish.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.120]   I don't want us being alone when there's so many people
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.020]   who love Jesus right here.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:02.460]   When the church is meant to be the help of God
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.820]   in the world, when we are meant to be his activity,
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:09.040]   his hands and his feet, his provision may very much be
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.300]   the people in your life, the right people in your life.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.840]   And so we've talked about what the right
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.080]   and the wrong look like.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.500]   So this isn't a sermon where we get reflective,
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.580]   I'm actually gonna get you all to just go ahead and stand.
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.780]   As the worship team comes up on stage,
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.380]   everyone go ahead and stand up.
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.880]   All right, everybody stand up, stand up, stand up.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:38.500]   And the way I wanna end this whole series,
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.780]   we've learned lots of things.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:45.260]   We've understood lots of ways, things that God has for us,
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.940]   how we begin well.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:51.060]   And I wanna pray for us that we would be able
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.140]   to find the right people.
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.860]   I wanna pray commissioning us to actually following through
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.740]   and investing in the right relationships.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.280]   I wanna pray for the boldness to be able to do that,
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.700]   for the vulnerability that that requires,
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.540]   because that's not always easy.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:11.560]   A lot of us carry hurt from wrong people,
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.500]   wrong relationships that make it so hard
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.140]   to step into the right relationships.
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:17.860]   And God's not just gonna wash over that,
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.180]   he's gonna deal with that hurt.
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:24.020]   And so if you will, I'm gonna ask you to close your eyes
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.140]   and just open your hands as a sign,
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:31.860]   as a posture of receiving this prayer, not from me,
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:37.400]   but through what only God can do.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.980]   Jesus, we come before you this morning,
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.780]   and first of all, we say thank you for your love.
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.260]   We thank you for the love that you give us
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.300]   that even equips us and allows us to love others.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.300]   We thank you for this cloud of witnesses
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.900]   that we have with us in this room.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.500]   We thank you for relationship
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.940]   and how you've designed things to be a certain way.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.220]   Father, we recognize, we understand, and we see it.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.260]   And we ask first, God, for those of us
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.860]   who are looking for spiritual friendship,
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.980]   sacrificial friendship, friends who actually love,
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.500]   relationships that actually model a love for you.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:16.500]   Holy Spirit, would you begin to show us where to look?
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.480]   God, would you give us the right metric?
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.300]   Would you help us not just look at the things
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.920]   that we see with our eyes,
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.060]   but help us to evaluate correctly?
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:31.220]   Help us to find people who are gonna put you first,
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.820]   who are gonna love you, and whose relationship with us
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:37.700]   will push us into greater love and obedience to you,
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:41.900]   people who will help us be more disciples of Christ.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.460]   God, we ask for those people.
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:49.420]   God, for those of us who carry scars and burdens
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.660]   and frustrations of past relationships
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.580]   with the wrong people, moments where we've been hurt,
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.060]   moments where we've not been heard,
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.900]   taken advantage of, forgotten, neglected,
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:04.900]   whatever the word is, God, you see what happens.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.620]   You see the scars we carry,
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.140]   and your heart breaks for us,
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.580]   but you also don't stop there
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:11.300]   because you're a God of healing,
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.760]   you're a God that restores.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:16.620]   So Holy Spirit, would you restore our hearts,
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.460]   restore the parts that are broken,
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.500]   and make whole again what is needed?
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:24.300]   Would you give us the boldness, supernaturally,
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.300]   to be able to step into the right relationships?
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.580]   Would you allow us to be able to invest
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.460]   into the right relationships?
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.360]   Holy Spirit, would you transform us,
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.100]   continue to transform us,
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.500]   not just to receive the right people,
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:42.220]   but God, may the vine be full of people
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.380]   who are the right people for others.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.560]   Holy Spirit, do your work in us.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:50.340]   As we step into this year of action,
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.100]   may we go with the right start,
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.180]   may we make the right choices,
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.540]   may we wear the right clothes,
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.320]   and Holy Spirit, would we go with the right people?
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.740]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
