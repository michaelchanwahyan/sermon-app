1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:14,560
 - Imagine with me for a moment, a church.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,600
 This is not a church in the singular,

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,260
 on its own and distinct, but a church in the plural,

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,480
 united across a nation, joined in purpose,

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,240
 focused on building up God's kingdom one life at a time.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,800
 It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA,

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,360
 the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,760
 and that celebrates in the freedom and grace

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,600
 that such a story brings.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,680
 This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,400
 but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,880
 desiring for God's kingdom to take root

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,760
 and bear fruit in local soil.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,960
 A church that sees salvation as holistic,

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,780
 transforming God's people for God's work,

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,800
 and equipping a generation to represent God's heart

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,600
 to the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the persecuted.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,520
 Imagine this church committed to seeing the family

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,860
 as integral to all that it's called to be and do,

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,240
 involving intentional, committed,

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,120
 and authentic relationships across all levels.

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,000
 It is the sort of place where both the young

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,420
 and the old feel cared for, supported, and equipped.

25
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,720
 A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,000
 come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,680
 that honors and embraces a richness in diversity

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,920
 that marks us as the body of Christ.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,480
 It is a church that is willing to innovate

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,000
 and express faith creatively,

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,200
 reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,560
 as glory to him.

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,880
 A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,600
 and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives,

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
 where they seek to develop an intelligent spiritual faith

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,880
 rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.

37
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,880
 A church that does not make its Sunday services

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,200
 the exclamation mark of its existence,

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,420
 but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,

40
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,000
 a time of service, love, and engagement

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,080
 that inspires and emboldens all equally

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,260
 for the conversation that lies ahead.

43
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,400
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,720
 This is our city.

45
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,240
 This is our church.

46
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,520
 This is our home.

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,460
 - Good morning, how's everyone doing?

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,460
 Welcome to the Vine Yunlong.

49
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,720
 I'm not Tim, but my name is Justin.

50
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,560
 I'm one of the pastors at the Vine Wan Chai.

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,220
 You're probably wondering, where is Tim?

52
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,840
 Where is our pastor?

53
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,460
 Actually, he's not feeling quite well,

54
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,260
 so he asked me whether I could service lead today,

55
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,280
 and I gladly said yes.

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,820
 Even behind the scenes, Tim, Ivan, and I,

57
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,800
 we have a lot to talk about,

58
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,160
 and we often support each other,

59
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,560
 so it's great to be here.

60
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,200
 (soft piano music)

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,240
 Yeah, just grab a seat, have a seat.

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,600
 It's good to see everyone.

63
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,280
 You know, every Saturday morning,

64
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,820
 or every Saturday before Sunday,

65
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,640
 I ask myself, you know,

66
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,680
 what's gonna happen tomorrow on Sunday?

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
 You know, Lord, what are you gonna do?

68
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,200
 And yesterday morning on Saturday,

69
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,080
 I did not know I would be here,

70
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,820
 I would get to spend time with you in Yunlong,

71
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,400
 and I'm just, I think it's God's thing, you know,

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,020
 just to, yeah, just really, just to bring us places,

73
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,520
 and I think all of you are here for a reason.

74
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,260
 I know a lot of you, this is your home church,

75
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,560
 and so, church, I just wanna ask you,

76
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,400
 what is your expectation as we come here

77
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,600
 to worship together today?

78
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,800
 And I just want you to think about that.

79
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,920
 What do you expect today?

80
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,720
 What are you expecting God to show you, to reveal to you?

81
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,280
 And so, as you think about this, church,

82
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,320
 can I ask you to stand?

83
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,740
 I'm gonna pray, and we are gonna spend this time

84
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,340
 in God's presence together on this beautiful Sunday,

85
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,840
 and so would you pray with me?

86
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,740
 Jesus, yeah, we just, yeah,

87
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,240
 we think about why we're here this morning,

88
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,420
 and it's not just because this is our church,

89
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,800
 but we are here because we want to encounter the living God.

90
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,620
 We want to spend time as church family

91
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,460
 to worship you, to hear your word today,

92
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,580
 to give you glory, to be reminded that you are God,

93
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,880
 we are your children, and so, Father,

94
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,080
 for those of us that we've had a tired week,

95
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,620
 we had a crazy week, Lord, we ask you to revive us today.

96
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,620
 We ask you to restore onto us peace and joy and rest,

97
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,860
 and Father, above all, we ask that you reveal yourself

98
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,940
 to all of us today, from the youngest

99
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,500
 to just all of us in this room.

100
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:30,920
 And so, Father, we thank you, and we just give you glory.

101
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,740
 We love you, in your name we pray, amen.

102
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,540
 Let's worship him together, church.

103
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,380
 (congregation laughing)

104
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,260
 - Thanks, Lord, thanks, Lord, send God is.

105

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,520
 And so, Father, hear our prayers this morning.

365
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,960
 So, church, I just want to ask you

366
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,760
 just to let your prayers rise.

367
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,160
 The things that you've been praying this week, this morning,

368
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,240
 the things that you know the Lord has heard you,

369
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,280
 just give that up to him.

370
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,400
 This is an act of faith for us as a community

371
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,320
 to know that together we come together

372
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,240
 because we know he hears us, he loves us.

373
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,600
 And there's something that we cannot attain

374
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,880
 on our own by ourselves.

375
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,440
 And that's why we gather like this every Sunday,

376
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,920
 as regular as much as we can.

377
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,000
 And so, Father, you see us, you hear our prayers.

378
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Together we now pray, Jesus, we love you, amen.

379
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,360
 Amen, amen.

380
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,760
 Let's give him a clap of offering, we can do that.

381
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,280
 It's good to see everyone.

382
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,880
 Thank you, worship team.

383
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,720
 Have a seat.

384
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,960
 And just as we're sitting, I just want you to,

385
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,280
 actually, what we're gonna do first,

386
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,160
 I would just actually like to welcome,

387
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,400
 if anyone here, you're here for the very first time,

388
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,480
 is there anyone here at the Van Yun Long,

389
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,680

390
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,200

391
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,960

392
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,600
 would you be so bold, welcome, welcome, guys.

393
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,960
 Let's give them a welcome.

394
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,640
 (audience applauding)

395
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,480
 You know, we at the Vine Church,

396
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,880
 we are actually now two churches in,

397
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,200
 well, we are one church in two different locations.

398
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
 I'm normally at the Wan Chai,

399
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,760
 and I think a lot of us have been to the Wan Chai,

400
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,480
 and so today, we just, yeah, I just wanna welcome you,

401
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,360

 Right now, we're gonna, parents, I'm gonna,

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,560
 we're actually gonna pray as a church for our children

409
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,400
 before they go for Kids for Christ Service,

410
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,360
 and so, parents, you can bring your kids afterwards

411
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,320
 to the teachers who are standing on the side,

412
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,640
 and so, can I ask us to stand, actually?

413
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,880
 Let's stand together.

414
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,240
 Children, we're gonna pray for you.

415
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,760
 Let's pray.

416
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,080
 Father, we thank you that together, Lord God, as a church,

417
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,240
 we are your children, and we can,

418
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,400
 you're gonna teach us today just of who you are,

419
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,320
 and right now, we wanna dedicate our young ones to you

420
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,280
 as they learn together, as they fellowship,

421
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,600
 as they really draw close to you

422
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,160
 with the teachers and our brothers and sisters.

423
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,880
 Father, we just pray that you encounter them,

424
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,080
 you pour your love,

425
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,600
 and you pour your everything into them, Father.

426
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,800
 That is our prayer, and so, we pray that the end of today,

427
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,840
 we can gather at the dining table

428
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,360
 or when we're walking out from here,

429
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,240
 and we can talk about you together.

430
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,480
 That is our prayer.

431
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,640
 Jesus, in your name we pray, amen.

432
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,640
 So, parents, children, you know where to do, what to do.

433
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,760
 Before you sit down, maybe you can say hi to one another,

434
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,120
 greet one another.

435
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,920
 Today is Francesca's birthday, is it?

436
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,280
 (audience cheering)

437
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,040
 It is, so, do say happy birthday to her.

438
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,200
 We're not gonna sing to you right now,

439
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,000
 but yeah, it's her birthday,

440
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,200
 and so, yeah, say hi to one another,

441
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,040
 and we'll wait for all the parents to come back as well.

442
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:11,540

 So, really good to see everyone.

466
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,680
 Actually, I was here a few Sundays last summer

467
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,320
 and it's just really good to see you guys.

468
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,520
 This is actually my first time in this venue.

469
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,240
 And so it's so good to finally imagine

470
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,120
 and not just imagine, but actually see your faces.

471
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,280
 Actually, I'll be back in a few weeks to preach.

472
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,400
 So, Tim and Ivan asked me to come

473
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,920
 and so I'm very happy to see you

474
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,040
 and so you can't get rid of me yet.

475
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,360
 So, hey, this morning I have a few announcements

476
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,680
 for us as a church family

477
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,720
 and I'd like to begin to actually invite Denise up first.

478
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,160
 She is our church administrator.

479
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,680
 You see her every week.

480
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,560
 And so, she's gonna share something

481
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,480
 and then, yeah, we'll go from there.

482
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,320
 Thank you.

483
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,680
 (audience applauding)

484
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,080
 Thank you.

485
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,000
 Today, I stand before everyone with a happy heart

486
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,600
 as I have made a difficult decision

487
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,280
 to depart from my role as church administrator

488
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,520
 of the Vine Church.

489
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,040
 I want to take this opportunity

490
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,400
 to express my deepest appreciation to every one of you.

491
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:51,480
 Serving as this role has been an incredible privilege

492
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,680
 and a true blessing in my life.

493
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,680
 The Vine Church, Yundong,

494
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,440
 has not only been a place of worship,

495
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,440
 but also a community and a family

496
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,280
 that has touched my heart in countless way.

497
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,520
 The Vine Church, Yundong,

498
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,520
 has always hold a special place in my heart

499
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,480
 and I am confident that

500
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,080
 our path will cross again in the future.

501
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,440
 I firmly believe in the continuous success

502
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,920
 and growth of this church

503
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,000
 and I have no doubt that

504
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,360
 the Vine Church will continue to make a profound impact

505
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,760
 on the life of many.

506
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:59,000
 May God's grace continue to guide and abundantly

507
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,880
 bless the Vine Church, Yundong.

508
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,720
 Thank you.

509
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,880
 (audience applauding)

510
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,520
 - We're gonna pray for Denise together as a church.

511
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
 Actually, I don't know if you know,

512
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,040
 but Denise has been here for a long while.

513
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,160
 Denise and I used to be on the same team

514
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,680
 and every week we would have our weekly catch-ups

515
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,360
 and I would secretly, selfishly ask Denise,

516
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,520
 Denise, you're not going yet, right?

517
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,440
 You're not going yet, right?

518
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,960
 It's like, no, no, it's not my time yet,

519
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,800
 it's not my time yet.

520
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,200
 And then this week as a church family,

521
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,440
 we heard about Denise's announcement

522
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,720
 and I just, I don't know, just to be here right now,

523
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,480
 it just means a lot, I think, for all of us.

524
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,560
 And so, church, can I ask you to stand?

525
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,600
 You can stretch out your hands

526
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,920
 and we're just gonna pray for you,

527
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,400
 we're gonna bless you, okay?

528
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:46,520
 Father, we pray as Denise's church family,

529
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,580
 even though she's stepping down from her role, Lord God,

530
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,280
 we are still family and she is still our sister

531
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,640
 and we just wanna first off thank you

532
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,560
 for bringing Denise to the Vine Wan Chai in Yundong

533
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,560
 and she's done so much, the things that can be seen

534
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,100
 and she's done even more behind the scenes.

535
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,640
 And she's such a humble person, Lord God,

536
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,320
 that she just does not draw attention to herself

537
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,080
 and she's done so much and you know that.

538
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,920
 And so, Father, we just thank you so much

539
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,200
 for the gift that Denise is.

540
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,520
 We thank you that she's always asking us how we're doing,

541
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,020
 she's bringing coffees, she's just caring for us,

542
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,160
 she's prayerfully just around, Father,

543
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,100
 and we just thank you so much.

544
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,920
 Thank you for, you know, the fact that we're here today,

545
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,320
 Denise has poured in so much into Vine Yundong.

546
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,660
 And so, Father, we just right now wanna just,

547
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,640
 as a church, gather around her

548
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,260
 and pray your blessing over her in the next season.

549
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,100
 Whatever it looks like, wherever she's gonna be, Father,

550
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,620
 whatever she puts her hands and minds and hearts to,

551
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,460
 Father, we pray that your gospel

552
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,720
 would be preached through Denise,

553
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,560
 that in her quiet but courageous, bold spirit,

554
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,180
 that you would be proclaimed.

555
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,860
 And so, Father, though we will miss her,

556
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,780
 we just are excited what she is gonna do

557
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,580
 and what you're gonna do with her and through her.

558
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,700
 And so, Father, we just celebrate Denise today

559
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,540
 with a heavy heart, but our heart is that

560
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,780
 you would pour your heart and your spirit over her

561
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,160
 for as long as, yeah, just for the days ahead, Jesus.

562
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,420
 In your name we pray, amen.

563
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,320
 >> Thank you.

564
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,300
 >> All right, so do take her out for coffee

565
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,220
 and do say hi to her, and yeah, have a seat.

566
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,040
 Thank you, church.

567
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,220
 I just have a few important announcements

568
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,140
 that I am tasked to bring to you,

569
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,300
 and two of them pertains to what's happening

570
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,360
 this coming up in March,

571
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,500
 and another one pertains to this Sunday.

572
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,980
 Pastor Tim told me that it is your culture

573
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,460
 that after service you would bring your own lunch

574
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,180
 and fellowship and have lunch together,

575
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,260
 and I think that is such a beautiful expression,

576
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,380
 and it's just the best way to spend Sunday afternoon.

577
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,500
 So if you don't have anywhere to go

578
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,940
 and you wanna get to know people,

579
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,140
 you want to reconnect, you wanna just hang out,

580
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
 so just ask you to, after service,

581
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,060
 go and grab lunch somewhere, come back,

582
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,680
 and we're gonna eat together,

583
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,700
 and Pastor Tim also reminded me

584
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,260
 of the special thing that you guys do,

585
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,500
 and during this lunch the goal is to talk

586
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,320
 to at least two people you don't know

587
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,940
 as well as catch up with everyone else,

588
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,180
 so I'm really happy to hear that.

589
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,540
 I hope you can come.

590
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,980
 I'm gonna join you later in March for this one

591
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,140
 if you have it on the 24th, so I'm excited for that.

592
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,340
 So two more announcements that pertains to March,

593
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,500
 and one of the big announcements is,

594
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,800
 do you guys know what's happening next Sunday?

595
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,260
 Yes, it's Vision Sunday, and so whether it's

596
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,120
 the wine, wine chai, or wine yunlong,

597
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,340
 March is our Vision Sunday, and this is a special time

598
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,100
 where Pastor Tim, Pastor Ivan is gonna bring

599
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,020
 a specific vision of what they are sensing,

600
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,120
 what the leadership is sensing for us as a church

601
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,120
 in terms of maybe God is calling us into something,

602
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,180
 he's calling us to think about something

603
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,900
 and work out something, and so this is a Sunday

604
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,820
 where we ask everyone coming to bring their tithes

605
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,940
 and offering that is beyond their normal giving

606
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,100
 because this is a time for us to, in faith,

607
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,340
 sow into the vision of what is happening here,

608
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,840
 and so in previous Vision Sundays, a few years ago,

609
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,300
 we had a vision to plant a church in Yunlong,

610
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,260
 and the Sunday, Vision Sunday after that,

611
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,860
 we started getting funds and fundraising

612
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,920
 for the Vine Church Yunlong, that was last year,

613
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,680
 and church, here we are.

614
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,440
 Right now, we are sitting in the generosity of God,

615
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,700
 the leading of God, and also the giving of everyone here

616
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,600
 and those in wine chai because we're a church,

617
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,440
 and so I just want to humbly ask you to come in faith,

618
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,780
 and if you say, hey, Justin, all I can give is a dollar,

619
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,420
 that's fine, you know, I think what's more important,

620
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,680
 I think what's on Tim and Ivan's heart and my heart

621
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,080
 and our heart at Divine Leadership

622
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,680
 is that you come in faith, and together,

623
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,960
 we hear what Pastor Tim and Ivan have for us

624
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,960
 as a Cantonese congregation as well as English congregation

625
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,880
 and how God is gonna ask us to grow, okay?

626
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,640
 So that's next Sunday, please come in faith,

627
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,480
 and then another thing that I wanna announce

628
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,680
 is the Sunday afterwards, which is March 9th, okay,

629
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,860
 from three o'clock to five o'clock,

630
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,540
 we are going to actually have

631
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,420
 a parenting workshop in Cantonese.

632
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,820
 So if you're a Cantonese speaker, you're a parent,

633
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,640
 or you know someone who could benefit

634
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,240
 from a parenting workshop,

635
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,240
 we'll have two special guest speakers

636
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,240
 who I'm curious to know who they are,

637
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,440
 and really, actually, the heart of this from Tim and Ivan

638
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,400
 is, you know, we are here to share the gospel,

639
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,040
 we're here to invest in this city,

640
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,280
 and one of the ways we do this

641
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,360
 is by hosting parenting workshops so that, as parents,

642
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,700
 those who have children, those who want to grow

643
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,280
 in our identity and role and responsibility as parents,

644
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,000
 we can come and support one another,

645
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,800
 and this is a tangible way

646
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,100
 in which we can support this neighborhood.

647
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,020
 And so if you speak Cantonese, once again,

648
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,980
 please, you're interested, you can get more information.

649
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,800
 Now, I know you're like, "Yo, Justin, I speak English."

650
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,440
 We're planning something in June, okay,

651
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,500
 for a parenting workshop in June, so stay tuned.

652
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,180
 Tim and Ivan will bring more news on that.

653
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,460
 Yes, thank you, it's a Saturday.

654
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,440
 Yes, thank you.

655
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,260
 So with that, I think I'm gonna,

656
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,120
 I'd like to ask the offering team to,

657
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,100
 we're gonna take up our weekly offering,

658
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,140
 and yeah, once again, there's many ways to give.

659
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,540
 You can give through the envelopes,

660
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,940
 you can also digitally give,

661
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,740
 and I think just on behalf of Tim and Ivan

662
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,780
 and the leadership, just want to continue

663
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,020
 just to thank you for your generosity.

664
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,800
 And really, once again, we are all sitting

665
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,260
 in each other's offering, the offering

666
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,720
 and the generosity of the church.

667
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,180
 And so, yeah, let's pray, and then,

668
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,180
 actually, I'm gonna ask Pastor John to come up first,

669
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,100
 and we're gonna pray for Pastor John

670
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,260
 as well as we're gonna pray for our offering.

671
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,500
 And so Pastor John is gonna give the word today,

672
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
 and you're a regular here, right?

673
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,780
 - Yeah, I am. - Yes, so.

674
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,060
 All right, let's pray. - I'm a regular boy.

675
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,340
 Father, we give you our offering, we give you ourselves,

676
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:29,940
 and we just ask that you continue to grow your bride,

677
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,180
 your church, your body.

678
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,380
 We ask you to grow you in long church.

679
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,740
 Together, we just, in faith, so every Sunday

680
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,940
 in our worship and in our relationships,

681
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,740
 knowing that you are leading us,

682
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,540
 you are preaching and proclaiming the gospel

683
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,940
 through each one of us.

684
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,100
 And so, Father, remind us how much you've given us

685
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,020
 so that we can be generous.

686
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,860
 And so, this morning, we thank you for Pastor John

687
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,700
 that he has prepared a word for us,

688
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,120
 that he's gonna preach this in faith,

689
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,880
 and we receive this in faith,

690
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,900
 knowing that you are speaking to each of us

691
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,620
 through Pastor John.

692
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,640
 So we make room in our hearts for you now, amen.

693
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,060
 - Thank you, Justin.

694
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:25,000
 Thank you, Justin, that was amazing.

695
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,480
 It's good to be with you this morning

696
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,460
 on this little cooler morning.

697
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:36,600
 I am a Hong Konger.

698
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,400
 Hong Kong is Sandra and I's adopted home

699
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,340
 and has been for the last 37 years.

700
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,100
 Its people are my family.

701
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:55,040
 My sons, their wives, and five grandchildren

702
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,540
 are also Hong Kongers.

703
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,280
 The grandchildren were all made in Hong Kong,

704
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,880
 well, to my knowledge, anyway.

705
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,580
 And they were born here, of that I can be sure.

706
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,940
 Don't be put off by my face.

707
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,420
 Yes, I am a guai lou.

708
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:23,180
 Don't be put off by my lack of Chinese.

709
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:28,100
 (speaking in foreign language)

710
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:33,100
 Well, to be truthful, (speaking in foreign language)

711
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,320
 I love Hong Kong.

712
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,660
 Tim told us last week that it doesn't matter

713
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,820
 whether we are an expat, a local,

714
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:51,160
 a domestic helper, or an asylum seeker.

715
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,580
 It doesn't matter whether we are a street sleeper

716
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,340
 or we're chairman of HSBC.

717
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:02,200
 This is home.

718
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:09,140
 And Tim used a famous passage in Jeremiah 29 to tell us.

719
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,380
 And yes, as he said, it does contain the famous

720
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,720
 2911 fridge magnet bookmark photo frame verse.

721
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,640
 To seek the peace and prosperity of the city.

722
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,020
 He reminded us that this word of God

723
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,760
 was given to a people in exile,

724
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,700
 the Israelites, who spent 70 years, yes, 70 years,

725
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:42,040
 as strangers and aliens in Babylon.

726
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,060
 Tim used this to challenge us

727
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,860
 to become engaged in our city.

728
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,860
 That there was no excuse for apathetic disengagement.

729
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,020
 But if that was the what,

730
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:07,580
 today I want to look at the how.

731
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:13,060
 How can I, as an expat, a domestic helper,

732
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:17,220
 asylum seeker, street sleeper, or chairman of HSBC,

733
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,300
 how can I, as a member of Vine Yuen Long,

734
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,580
 contribute, contribute to the peace

735
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,420
 and prosperity of our city?

736
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,900
 You see, whereas in the first message,

737
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,860
 we looked at how we relate to Hong Kong and Yuen Long

738
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,040
 from a big picture perspective,

739
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:44,200
 this time we want to look in more detail.

740
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,300
 What does it actually mean to love the place we're in

741
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:55,060
 and to work for its welfare and peace?

742
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,140
 More especially, how can we use

743
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,780
 the church's resources, our faith resources,

744
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,300
 to bring flourishing to Yuen Long?

745
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:09,420
 How can we use our difference to serve people?

746
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:16,420
 Today we will think about our spheres of influence

747
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,100
 and how we can contribute to the flourishing

748
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,300
 and well-being of Yuen Long and its people.

749
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,300
 So that people will see our good work

750
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,720
 and praise God in heaven.

751
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,660
 And I'll tell you something.

752
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,220
 I'm gonna make it simple.

753
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,980
 So embarrassingly simple.

754
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,500
 To demonstrate, I'm turning to two household items.

755
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,940
 They're actually all in this one thing.

756
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,420
 How can you talk about salt and light

757
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,260
 and have it in one thing?

758
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,020
 Look at that, salt and light.

759
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,740
 Press it again.

760
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:12,300
 Yes.

761
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,240
 Salt and light.

762
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,260
 It's for you, Byron.

763
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,300
 (audience laughing)

764
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,340
 Let's look at scripture.

765
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,940
 Let's turn to Matthew 5.

766
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,180
 Let's start at verse 13.

767
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,860
 You, yes you.

768
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,500
 You are the salt of the earth.

769
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,140
 But if salt's lost its taste,

770
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,340
 how shall its saltiness be restored?

771
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,500
 It is no longer good for anything

772
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,180
 except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.

773
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:59,540
 You are the light of the world.

774
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,300
 A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.

775
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,860
 Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket,

776
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,860
 but on a stand so it gives light to all the house.

777
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:18,740
 In the same way, let your light shine before others

778
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:23,460
 so that they may see your good works

779
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,300
 and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.

780
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:34,580
 Let me start by giving you some background.

781
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:39,140
 This section is from the Sermon on the Mount.

782
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,640
 Matthew 5, 6, 7.

783
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,940
 Amazing chapters.

784
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,940
 Jesus' audiences were the disciples of Jesus

785
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:55,100
 and the crowd who were the future disciples of Jesus.

786
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,600
 And what they were doing,

787
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,600
 they were weighing the cost of following Jesus.

788
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,580
 And the background to my teaching this morning

789
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:10,580
 can be found in Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on the Mount.

790
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,620
 And particularly his teaching on the kingdom of God

791
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,100
 also described as the kingdom of heaven.

792
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,760
 Jesus had told them in Matthew 4

793
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,320
 that repentance is the key to entering

794
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,240
 the kingdom of heaven.

795
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,360
 I've put it on the screen.

796
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,520
 From that time, Jesus began to preach,

797
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:35,520
 saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

798
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,440
 As the Sermon on the Mount continues,

799
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,760
 Jesus answers the important question.

800
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,520
 Who, who can enter the kingdom of heaven?

801
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,860
 Who can enter the kingdom of God?

802
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:56,920
 He answers it with what we call the Beatitudes.

803
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,200
 I heard that Billy Graham

804
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,280
 had actually called them beautiful attitudes.

805
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,120
 I love that.

806
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,140
 I heard a story of a Chinese Christian

807
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,100
 who came to a missionary one time and said,

808
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,720
 "I've learned to quote the Sermon on the Mount by memory."

809
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,800
 He stood before the missionary

810
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,800
 and perfectly quoted the sermon word for word.

811
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,440
 The missionary said, "That's wonderful.

812
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,820
 How did you do it?"

813
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,360
 The Chinese Christian said this,

814
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,220
 "I spent the last year trying to live it."

815
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:37,580
 Matthew 5, three to six tells us,

816
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:41,880
 "It is the poor and spirit, those who mourn, the meek,

817
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,160
 those who hunger and thirst for righteousness

818
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,020
 who can enter the kingdom of God."

819
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,600
 In verses seven to nine,

820
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,600
 he then describes the attitude of a kingdom person

821
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,500
 as merciful, pure in heart, a peacemaker.

822
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:02,020
 "We are told we will be called children of God."

823
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,820
 All this seems good.

824
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 But Matthew 5, 11 tells us how the world,

825
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,120
 how the world out there treats a kingdom citizen.

826
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:22,180
 Jesus said, "We will be insulted, persecuted,

827
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:27,540
 falsely bad mouthed, but that we would be blessed."

828
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:31,740
 Jesus then takes it a stage further.

829
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,980
 I put this one on the screen, Matthew 5, 12.

830
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:38,980
 "Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven.

831
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:44,860
 For in the same way, they persecuted the prophets

832
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,460
 who were before you."

833
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:51,460
 My friends, we are citizens of heaven.

834
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,820
 We are ambassadors of Christ.

835
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:59,100
 We are heirs of the kingdom of God.

836
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,740
 That is because of the work of Jesus on the cross

837
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,060
 and our faith and belief in Jesus.

838
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:11,980
 And this brings us to our message for today.

839
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:17,300
 How can I, as a member of Vine Yuan Long,

840
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,380
 how can I, as a citizen of heaven, an ambassador for Christ,

841
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,460
 an heir of the kingdom of God,

842
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,500
 contribute to the peace and prosperity of our city?

843
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,940
 I will tell you.

844
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,960
 I will tell you in 14 words.

845
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:42,660
 You are the salt of the earth.

846
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:48,020
 You are the light of the world.

847
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:53,220
 You are salt and light.

848
00:50:53,220 --> 00:51:00,340
 This is about our identity in Jesus.

849
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:06,340
 It's not about you trying to be something,

850
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,100
 but it's about what you are,

851
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,520
 what you already are in Jesus and in his kingdom.

852
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:22,640
 The beauty of the gospel is that God makes us his people

853
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,580
 and he gives us a new identity and a new purpose.

854
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:32,580
 And God calls us to figure out how to work out

855
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,200
 that identity in the world.

856
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,540
 So our identity is in Christ.

857
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:44,380
 Christ, who is the salt of the earth

858
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,220
 and the light of the world.

859
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:53,220
 And we, in our identity, become that in the world.

860
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,620
 Jesus told his disciples that despite the difficulties,

861
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,840
 despite the persecution,

862
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,760
 you are to be the salt and light of the world.

863
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,380
 When times are tough, we tend to quit.

864
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,220
 We tend to withdraw into our shell.

865
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,740
 We tend to go into our small community

866
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,360
 and be self-sufficient.

867
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:23,820
 Jesus said, "No, the citizens of my kingdom

868
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:27,220
 "have an important role to play in this world,

869
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,980
 "contributing to the peace of our city,

870
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,200
 "even in a world where there can be things

871
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,020
 "that are against our principles and ethics."

872
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,880
 Our mission, if you choose to accept it,

873
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:49,840
 is to be like salt and light in the world.

874
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,360
 So let's see this passage in two parts.

875
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,920
 The first one is salt.

876
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,840
 I'll repeat Matthew 13.

877
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,000
 You are the salt of the earth,

878
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,760
 but if salt has lost its taste,

879
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,520
 how should its saltiness be restored?

880
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,000
 It's no longer good for anything

881
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.

882
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,420
 You are the salt of the earth.

883
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,420
 The first metaphor that Jesus uses

884
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,420
 for our connection with the world

885
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,200
 or our engagement with the world

886
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,800
 is that we are to be salt.

887
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:35,620
 Salt has been used by humanity for over 6,000 years.

888
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:39,940
 What was the idea of salt

889
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:43,060
 in the thinking of the ancient world?

890
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,820
 Well, salt was a very valuable commodity

891
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,660
 in the ancient world.

892
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,740
 It was like money.

893
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,960
 There are records that sometimes at some places,

894
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,880
 Roman soldiers might receive their pay,

895
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,020
 their wages, their salary in salt.

896
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:02,020
 That's where the word salary comes from, see?

897
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:02,860
 Salt.

898
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,800
 You go to a pay table

899
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,260
 and they give you a little pouch with a salt.

900
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:15,160
 That's how valuable and sellable salt

901
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,160
 was in the ancient world.

902
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,160
 I can think of three major uses of salt.

903
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,200
 Salt as a preservative agent,

904
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,640
 as a flavoring agent,

905
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,520
 and as a healing agent.

906
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,020
 Let's take them one at a time.

907
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,920
 Firstly, a preserving agent.

908
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,660
 In the ancient world and even today,

909
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,500
 salt is used to preserve meat.

910
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,200
 Salted meat and fish became a necessity

911
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,720
 in the day before the refrigerator was invented.

912
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,800
 The refrigerator's only 200 years old, right?

913
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,800
 The very basic way is that you could pack it with salt

914
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,340
 and dry it up so that you could preserve the meat.

915
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:08,280
 And the idea behind salt

916
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:12,160
 is very much about preserving influence.

917
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,360
 Christians are to serve as a preserving influence

918
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,500
 in the world against decay.

919
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,440
 That's what Jesus is saying to his disciples.

920
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,940
 You are to be like a preservative in the world.

921
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:34,000
 If the world around you is wicked, arrogant, and sinful,

922
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,280
 the believers in its midst must act like a preservative

923
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,880
 and make it slow down in its progress to decay.

924
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,620
 We should make the world better.

925
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:53,620
 There's something distinct about us.

926
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,960
 God's goodness in us

927
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,200
 protects us against the decay of the world.

928
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:08,960
 At the cross, Jesus defeated death

929
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,960
 and the system of the world.

930
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,960
 Now we become a preserving factor for goodness.

931
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,400
 I mean, take a look around you.

932
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,080
 Do you see the growing trend

933
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,760
 towards dishonesty, corruption, immorality,

934
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,360
 violence, pornography,

935
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,160
 and the diminishing respect for human life?

936
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,900
 Whose fault is it?

937
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,920
 Let me put it this way.

938
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,460
 If meat goes bad,

939
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,300
 it's no point in blaming the meat.

940
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:48,520
 That is what happens when bacteria

941
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,680
 are allowed to breed unchecked.

942
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,040
 The question to ask is, where is the salt?

943
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,380
 My question to you this morning,

944
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,400
 where is the salt?

945
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,100
 Salt is also a flavoring agent.

946
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,180
 Salt is used to season our food.

947
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,700
 Some of you, I've seen you,

948
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,400
 you love your salt like anything.

949
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,540
 I see people salt their food

950
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,400
 before they even taste it, right?

951
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,700
 I'm British, right?

952
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,980
 We love fish and chips.

953
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,880
 But the best bit of fish and chips

954
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,420
 is actually the salt and the vinegar.

955
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,900
 (audience laughing)

956
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,780
 Of course.

957
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:43,700
 Salt greatly enhances the flavor of the food.

958
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,000
 We're supposed to be there to make society better.

959
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,100
 The world is supposed to be better

960
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,400
 because of the fact that the disciples of Jesus are in it.

961
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,740
 Sometimes the world doesn't understand that.

962
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,920
 It often persecutes believers.

963
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,460
 My friends,

964
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,120
 there is no area of your life

965
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,480
 that Jesus doesn't come into.

966
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,360
 He comes into your personal life,

967
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,360
 your family life, your professional life,

968
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,360
 your relationship with others,

969
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,360
 and in all those relationships,

970
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:22,260
 you are a preservative against corruption of the world.

971
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:27,640
 You must be a flavoring in your workplace.

972
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,480
 You must be a flavoring in your schools and colleges.

973
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,840
 Christians must be the salt in hospitals

974
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,320
 and other workplaces.

975
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:43,880
 But lastly, salt is a healing agent.

976
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:49,560
 Universally, salt is seen as a healing agent.

977
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,400
 The use of salt and salt water

978
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,160
 can be traced right the way back

979
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,640
 to Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians,

980
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,560
 all of whom used it to treat cuts,

981
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,040
 wounds, and skin irritations.

982
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,140
 Today, thousands of years later,

983
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:11,140
 a concentrated form of salt water is called saline, right,

984
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:15,640
 and is routinely used in medical.

985
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,220
 Saline is sterile.

986
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,940
 Oh, there's so much hurt, you know.

987
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,420
 Mistrust in our world today.

988
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,660
 Our world is polarized, right?

989
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:31,080
 Democrats or Republicans.

990
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,220
 Even here, right, yellows and blues.

991
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,840
 Even in churches,

992
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,680
 division between Protestants and Catholics.

993
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,120
 Local and international churches.

994
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,720
 Denominations, charismatics and evangelicals,

995
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,020
 whatever those words mean.

996
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,720
 I wanna make a declaration today.

997
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,040
 I'm declaring it over this church.

998
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,680
 I declare that the Vine Yuen Long

999
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,080
 is a bridge-building community.

1000
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,080
 Can I hear amen?

1001
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:03,920
 - Amen.

1002
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,640
 - A tearer down of walls.

1003
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:13,280
 God's healing agent.

1004
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,560
 Salt.

1005
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,040
 We serve as the preserving agent,

1006
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:24,220
 the flavoring agent, and the healing agent to the world.

1007
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,260
 Now let's move from salt to light.

1008
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,620
 It's interesting.

1009
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,120
 We are the light of the world.

1010
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,780
 Go right to the beginning of your Bible.

1011
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,340
 I mean, people don't carry Bibles so much these days,

1012
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,940
 but you look, you know, go right to the beginning.

1013
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,380
 Genesis chapter one.

1014
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,520
 You know, iPhones are safe.

1015
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,220
 Genesis one, in the beginning.

1016
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,420
 Right, first words.

1017
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:50,420
 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

1018
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,580
 Now the earth was formless and empty.

1019
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,340
 Darkness was over the surface of the deep,

1020
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:59,180
 and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

1021
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:03,140
 And God said, the first thing we see recorded

1022
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:07,820
 that God said was this, "Let there be light."

1023
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,020
 And there was light.

1024
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:14,260
 And God saw that the light was good,

1025
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:18,940
 and he separated the light from the darkness.

1026
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:21,100
 Can I read some more verses

1027
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,500
 to show you where I'm heading with this?

1028
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,620
 2 Corinthians 4, 6.

1029
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:29,620
 For God said, "Let your light shine out of darkness."

1030
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:33,260
 Made his light shine in our hearts

1031
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:37,500
 to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory

1032
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,520
 displayed in the face of Christ.

1033
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,700
 1 John 1, 5.

1034
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,960
 God is light.

1035
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,580
 In him, there is no darkness at all.

1036
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:50,380
 And then Jesus, in 8, 12, said this.

1037
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,500
 "I am the light of the world."

1038
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,340
 One of the seven I am's, right?

1039
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,740
 I am the light of the world.

1040
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:00,140
 So God is the light.

1041
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,300
 Jesus is the light of the world.

1042
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:06,980
 Now Jesus looks at his followers.

1043
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,900
 He looks at you.

1044
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:13,420
 You are the light of the world.

1045
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:15,900
 Jesus is saying, "Just like I shine in the world,

1046
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,020
 now I want you to shine in the world."

1047
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,460
 And Matthew 5, 14, which we read earlier,

1048
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:25,100
 you are the light of the world.

1049
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,860
 Believers are the light of the world.

1050
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,900
 This is hard to imagine.

1051
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,880
 Like Jesus said these seven I am's, right?

1052
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,700
 But the only I am that he said you are is light.

1053
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:42,340
 Jesus don't say, "Hey, Kieran, you're the good shepherd."

1054
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:45,740
 Or, you know, "You're the way, the truth, and the life."

1055
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,740
 But he does say, "I am the light of the world."

1056
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:56,340
 And he then says, "You are the light of the world."

1057
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,460
 This is a great compliment,

1058
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:01,640
 but also a great responsibility.

1059
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:07,720
 That is a powerful declaration of the individual worth

1060
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,260
 and mission of every believer.

1061
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:13,420
 Can we just stop and reflect on that a moment?

1062
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,580
 It's just so important.

1063
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,380
 Jesus who said, "I am the light of the world,"

1064
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,500
 then says, "Chapman, you are the light of the world."

1065
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,140
 That's a responsibility and a privilege, I tell you.

1066
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:33,120
 Light is visibility and radiance.

1067
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:37,220
 Let's go back on these verses again.

1068
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:40,460
 You are the light of the world.

1069
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:46,580
 A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.

1070
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,700
 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.

1071
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,420
 Instead, they put it in the stand

1072
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:55,260
 and it gives light to everyone in the house.

1073
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:59,260
 In the same way, let your light shine before others

1074
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,620
 that they might see your good deeds

1075
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:04,740
 and glorify your Father in heaven.

1076
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,100
 Just four things in that verse is,

1077
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,140
 we are the light of the world.

1078
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,260
 We are a city on a hill.

1079
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,460
 We are to be visible.

1080
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:16,260
 And our visibility is done by action.

1081
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,420
 Good deeds.

1082
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:24,220
 To come into the light means to come out of hiding.

1083
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:29,300
 We are to be visible in society

1084
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,060
 with the light of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1085
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,780
 The light is the gospel.

1086
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:36,900
 The gospel has to radiate from our lives.

1087
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,820
 When your light shines,

1088
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:42,020
 some will accept and turn to the Father,

1089
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,660
 but some will reject us.

1090
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,140
 But if we're neutral,

1091
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:50,900
 something is wrong with our Christian effectiveness.

1092
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:55,420
 Our good deeds must radiate from us.

1093
01:04:55,420 --> 01:05:01,980
 What great responsibility has been given to us?

1094
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,820
 There is not another light

1095
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:08,180
 that Jesus is shining in the world.

1096
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:11,500
 You.

1097
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,620
 You.

1098
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,740
 Are the light of the world.

1099
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:20,020
 Jesus said, "I want you to be my light.

1100
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,380
 "I want you to be my instrument.

1101
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:25,380
 "You are like my body, my hands and my mouth

1102
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,780
 "and my feet on this earth.

1103
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:30,140
 "You are the light of the world."

1104
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,540
 And we are called to keep that light burning.

1105
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:36,300
 I mean, think about life in Jesus' time.

1106
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,900
 They didn't have any artificial light

1107
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,620
 like we do today, right?

1108
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:42,580
 You know, they had oil lamps.

1109
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,940
 You know, every house had an oil lamp.

1110
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,580
 And these are the kind of lights

1111
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,100
 that Jesus is talking about.

1112
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:52,060
 You are the light of the world.

1113
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:56,860
 Now, individually, one of these might not be too bright,

1114
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:02,180
 but vine yun long.

1115
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:04,540
 I believe together,

1116
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,580
 together,

1117
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:09,860
 we can light up the entire area.

1118
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:15,740
 Oil is a biblical symbol of the Holy Spirit.

1119
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:20,060
 We are to be like the wise bridesmaids

1120
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,180
 who had their lamps full,

1121
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:27,540
 full of oil and full of the Holy Spirit

1122
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,220
 rather than the foolish ones.

1123
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:34,420
 But as I draw towards a conclusion,

1124
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,460
 I need to ask you a hard question.

1125
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,020
 I'm gonna be straight with you.

1126
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:45,700
 If we truly wish to contribute to the peace of our city,

1127
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:50,340
 are we living as the sword of the earth

1128
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,700
 and the light of the world?

1129
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,780
 Or are we living just like the world?

1130
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:00,580
 Living in sin, living in flesh?

1131
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:01,860
 I'm not judging, by the way.

1132
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,140
 And the good news is that we can repent

1133
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:07,980
 and ask for forgiveness.

1134
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:13,980
 But given this chance in 2024,

1135
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:18,780
 let us commit, let's commit together

1136
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:22,460
 that the Vine Church Yun Long will be holy,

1137
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:25,460
 will be separated and be life and salt.

1138
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:29,220
 I will pray for that for us for the moment.

1139
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:35,660
 And I want to end on a positive note.

1140
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:41,580
 Some things that we can do to be salt and light.

1141
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:47,900
 And the first one is this, share your faith in Christ.

1142
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:53,780
 One of the most powerful evangelism tools you have

1143
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:58,780
 is your personal story of coming to faith in Christ.

1144
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:03,020
 What I was like before,

1145
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:08,900
 how I met Christ and the difference He's made to my life.

1146
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:13,020
 Now, unbelievers may not be interested

1147
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:18,020
 in discussing Bible verses or spiritual doctrines,

1148
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:21,580
 but they will likely be willing to hear your story.

1149
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:27,940
 Look for a point of connection with your colleague,

1150
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,540
 your friend or neighbor,

1151
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:33,340
 and share about the difference that you've made.

1152
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:36,980
 The difference that Christ has made in your life.

1153
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,980
 No one can argue with that.

1154
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:43,620
 For the more shy.

1155
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:47,140
 Can I encourage you?

1156
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,460
 It's not about preaching.

1157
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:52,380
 Some words which were wrongly attributed

1158
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,860
 to Francis of Assisi said,

1159
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:57,260
 "Preach the gospel at all times.

1160
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,940
 "Use words if necessary."

1161
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:05,940
 My personal story is that I actually reached

1162
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:10,940
 more people for Christ when I was in the insurance business

1163
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,980
 than I do as a pastor.

1164
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:17,300
 You see, I spent most of my time now with Christians,

1165
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:23,460
 but I didn't stand on my desk and preach a sermon.

1166
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:27,620
 I didn't give out tracts and text the whole time.

1167
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,060
 I didn't preach the whole time

1168
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:33,500
 or invite them to church every five minutes.

1169
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:40,980
 No, but they knew that my door was always open to them.

1170
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:47,060
 It was the way I treated them.

1171
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:51,700
 The smile, let's have a practice, come on.

1172
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:57,420
 The words of encouragement.

1173
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:02,980
 That supportive text or email, very easy to do, right?

1174
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:06,580
 That offer to pray for them

1175
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:08,660
 when they were going through a tough time.

1176
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:12,340
 It's funny though, sometimes on the side there,

1177
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:16,060
 you know, I should say, I'll pray for you about that.

1178
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,700
 They say, "Oh, yes, yes, yes."

1179
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,140
 And they're thinking I'm gonna pray for them

1180
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,460
 when I get home, you know?

1181
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,220
 I say, "Come on then, let's pray."

1182
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,740
 We can all do that.

1183
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:30,100
 Second thing is take your light where it's dark.

1184
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:33,740
 A young girl once consulted with her pastor.

1185
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:37,140
 She's, "I can't stick it out any longer.

1186
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:40,580
 I'm the only Christian in my company where I work.

1187
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:43,860
 I get nothing but taunts and sneers.

1188
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,700
 It's more than I can stand, I'm gonna resign."

1189
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:53,340
 The pastor said, "Will you tell me where lights are placed?"

1190
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,860
 She, "What's this got to do with it?"

1191
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:01,340
 "Nevermind," the pastor said, "answer my question.

1192
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:04,140
 Where are lights placed?"

1193
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:07,820
 "I suppose," she said, "in dark places."

1194
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:12,820
 He said, "Yes, and that's why you have been put

1195
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:15,460
 in a company with such spiritual darkness

1196
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:19,140
 and where there is no other Christian to shine for the Lord."

1197
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,220
 The young Christian realized for the first time

1198
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,580
 the opportunity that was hers.

1199
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:26,420
 She felt that she could not fail God

1200
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,500
 by allowing her light to go out.

1201
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,980
 She went back to the factory, to the office

1202
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:34,740
 with renewed determination to let her light shine

1203
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,980
 in a dark corner.

1204
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:39,820
 Before long, she was the means

1205
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:42,740
 of leading nine other girls to the Lord.

1206
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:49,980
 And lastly, shine together as the torch.

1207
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,500
 If we were to turn the lights out here today,

1208
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,540
 and it was in darkness, and I got my iPhone out

1209
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:02,620
 and put my torch on, that would be light in the darkness,

1210
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:06,380
 but it wouldn't be very powerful.

1211
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,580
 If we were all to take our iPhones out

1212
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:11,500
 and all put our torches on, sorry,

1213
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,420
 I didn't mean to advertise for Apple.

1214
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:16,300
 If we would take our smartphones out,

1215
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:19,540
 if we would take our smartphones out

1216
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:23,020
 and all put our torch on, it would make a difference.

1217
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,220
 That is such a picture.

1218
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:30,020
 What strikes me about Vian Yuen Long

1219
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:33,740
 and why Sandra and I love coming here is this.

1220
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:37,620
 You are a community.

1221
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:41,500
 You are a community.

1222
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:47,820
 And the word unity is a big part of community.

1223
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:48,820
 Community.

1224
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:56,140
 Let us resolve to shine our torches together.

1225
01:12:56,140 --> 01:13:01,940
 That the lights are on at Vian Yuen Long 24/7.

1226
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:04,020
 I'm not talking about Hongshan Lee building,

1227
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,860
 the election bill would be rather pathetic,

1228
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:10,860
 but our lights are on 24/7.

1229
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:15,660
 Let us commit to being salt and light.

1230
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:20,380
 I believe that this is the key to contributing

1231
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:23,580
 to the peace and the prosperity of our city.

1232
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:31,380
 As I close, I believe there will be

1233
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:35,700
 a number of significant shifts.

1234
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:41,060
 I see this prophetically, and please weigh this up.

1235
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:46,180
 I see a spiritual earthquake.

1236
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:52,660
 In the natural, as what are called tectonic plates

1237
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:56,060
 interact with each other, energy is released

1238
01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:00,340
 as seismic waves causing the ground to shake.

1239
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:05,060
 This is an earthquake.

1240
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:11,860
 I see a spiritual earthquake.

1241
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:16,700
 And in this spiritual earthquake, I believe we'll see the following.

1242
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:23,580
 Firstly, we will see service, not selfishness.

1243
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:27,860
 Can I repeat that?

1244
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:31,180
 Service.

1245
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:35,260
 Oh, pastor, I'm leaving the church.

1246
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,780
 I'm not getting fed.

1247
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:39,420
 You heard that so many times, right?

1248
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:41,420
 It's all about me, me, me, me, me.

1249
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:44,620
 Selfishness.

1250
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:47,140
 Service, not selfishness.

1251
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:52,900
 Living our lives for each other and the community at large

1252
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:57,540
 at the expense of worrying about our own individual needs

1253
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,540
 or even the needs of just our church.

1254
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:04,380
 Philippians 2, 3 says this,

1255
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:10,380
 "Be humble, thinking of others as better than ourselves."

1256
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:15,660
 I believe we will see as part of this spiritual earthquake

1257
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:17,260
 a healed community.

1258
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:20,820
 A healed community.

1259
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:28,220
 To show how ethnic, political, generational separation

1260
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,980
 and division can be healed in this community.

1261
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:32,980
 Look at us.

1262
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,980
 Just take a look around the church.

1263
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,980
 We're a diverse bunch.

1264
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:40,980
 Different races.

1265
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,980
 Different colour faces.

1266
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:46,980
 Different backgrounds.

1267
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,980
 Different first languages.

1268
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,980
 In a world that is divided,

1269
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:58,980
 with societies and families becoming even more polarised,

1270
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:02,980
 we can become a major contribution

1271
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:05,980
 in the unity part of our community.

1272
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:11,980
 And lastly, we will be carriers of hope.

1273
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:15,980
 Carriers of hope.

1274
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:19,980
 I mean, just read your newspapers.

1275
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,980
 Hope.

1276
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,980
 Seems nowhere to be found these days.

1277
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:27,980
 Instead of saying, "We're going to be a community,

1278
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:31,980
 instead of cynicism and despair,

1279
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:36,980
 we carry real hope even in the midst of disorientation.

1280
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:40,980
 Even in the midst of pain in our city."

1281
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:43,980
 Tim called it out last week.

1282
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,980
 He stated it clearly.

1283
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:48,980
 Fear.

1284
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:54,980
 Fear has become a giant in our city.

1285
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:59,980
 And its people are gripped by it.

1286
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:03,980
 And are desperately lacking in hope.

1287
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:06,980
 Especially our young people.

1288
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:13,980
 Our contribution is hope.

1289
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:17,980
 Because of what the Bible describes as Christ in you,

1290
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,980
 the hope of glory.

1291
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:23,980
 We are the hope for this city

1292
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,980
 because Christ is the hope for our city.

1293
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:31,980
 And we just don't take care of our own tribe.

1294
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:37,980
 We also do work for the peace, the security, the justice

1295
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:40,980
 and the prosperity of our neighbours.

1296
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:43,980
 Loving them in word and deed.

1297
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:48,980
 Whether or not they believe the same thing

1298
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:50,980
 as we believe.

1299
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,980
 Vine, you're love.

1300
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:58,980
 I bless you.

1301
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:01,980
 I bless you.

1302
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,980
 To be salt.

1303
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,980
 And to be light.

1304
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:08,980
 Would you stand up? I'd love to pray for you as the band comes back.

1305
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:10,980
 I bless you.

1306
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:28,980
 Would you just put your hands out in front of you please?

1307
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,980
 This is not a religious thing that we do.

1308
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,980
 It's just to say to God I'm open to what you have.

1309
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:36,980
 I think the word that came pretty early on in there

1310
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,980
 and I've got to deal with it

1311
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,980
 is repent.

1312
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:45,980
 We're all sinners.

1313
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:51,980
 And before we talk about going out to the world out there

1314
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,980
 and doing all these wonderful things,

1315
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:56,980
 let's just come before God.

1316
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:59,980
 Say Jesus Christ,

1317
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,980
 I believe you're the Son of God.

1318
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,980
 Jesus Christ, I believe you died for my sins.

1319
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,980
 Jesus, forgive my sins and

1320
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:10,980
 come into my life by your Holy Spirit.

1321
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:16,980
 Lord, I choose today to repent of all my wrongdoings,

1322
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,980
 my wrong attitudes,

1323
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:22,980
 my biases towards people.

1324
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:27,980
 Forgive me, Lord.

1325
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,980
 And use me.

1326
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,980
 And Lord, together, Lord,

1327
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:40,980
 we ask for an anointing to be upon this church.

1328
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,980
 A fresh anointing.

1329
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:50,980
 Hong Kong doesn't need another church.

1330
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:52,980
 There are plenty of churches in Hong Kong.

1331
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:57,980
 But Hong Kong and Yuen Long in this area

1332
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:01,980
 needs a church who are willing to be salt and light for him.

1333
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:05,980
 My friend, that's a sacrifice.

1334
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:10,980
 I know when you go home today,

1335
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,980
 you say that was a good sermon, it tickled your ear.

1336
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,980
 And you get on with life and you live life as normal.

1337
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:19,980
 Being salt and light means living differently.

1338
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:24,980
 Being salt and light means having different priorities.

1339
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:28,980
 It means treating people differently.

1340
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:34,980
 For some of you, it means looking at your workplace colleagues differently.

1341
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:39,980
 Your neighbors.

1342
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:45,980
 Holy Spirit,

1343
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:52,980
 think of that old song, "Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning."

1344
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,980
 That's what I want to pray.

1345
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:57,980
 Lord, that you would fill our lamps with oil

1346
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:00,980
 and keep them burning bright for you.

1347
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:07,980
 I confess, Lord, I want to be salt and light,

1348
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:12,980
 but so many times, Lord, I fail you.

1349
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:17,980
 Lord, I pray today

1350
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:21,980
 that you will help me.

1351
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,980
 Help me.

1352
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:29,980
 Help me to be salt and light.

1353
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:35,980
 I wonder if you just join hands across the congregation,

1354
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:37,980
 I want to pray for us together.

1355
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:42,980
 Just join hands together if we can.

1356
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:50,980
 Because I believe this is something we need to pray for collectively.

1357
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:59,980
 Buying you long is just not to be an alternative place to come to on a Sunday morning

1358
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:02,980
 because one shy is too far on the MTR.

1359
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:08,980
 God has ordained this place for a purpose,

1360
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:12,980
 to be salt and light in this community.

1361
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:16,980
 But we have to do this together.

1362
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:20,980
 Join us together, Lord,

1363
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,980
 as your people.

1364
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:29,980
 We pray now for the people of Yuen Long.

1365
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,980
 We pray now for the people of Hong Kong.

1366
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:37,980
 Help us collectively, Lord,

1367
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:44,980
 to be years by years,

1368
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:46,980
 and for your glory.

1369
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:48,980
 Holy Spirit.

1370
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,980
 I want to see the Holy Spirit just,

1371
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,980
 this is like an electric current as we're going around,

1372
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:56,980
 we're joined together.

1373
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:58,980
 Holy Spirit just flowing through us.

1374
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:02,980
 Flowing for you onto the person next to you,

1375
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:04,980
 and vice versa.

1376
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,980
 Holy Spirit, come.

1377
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,980
 Fill me afresh.

1378
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,980
 I surrender to you now.

1379
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:16,980
 Use me for your glory, Lord, to be salt

1380
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,980
 and light.

1381
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:27,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1382
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:31,980
 the way maker,

1383
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:34,980
 the miracle worker.

1384
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:38,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1385
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1386
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:43,980
 the way maker, the miracle worker.

1387
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:46,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1388
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1389
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:52,980
 the way maker, the miracle worker.

1390
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:55,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1391
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:58,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1392
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:01,980
 the way maker, the miracle worker.

1393
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1394
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1395
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:09,980
 the way maker, the miracle worker.

1396
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:12,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1397
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:15,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1398
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:18,980
 the way maker, the miracle worker.

1399
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:21,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1400
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:24,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1401
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:27,980
 the way maker, the miracle worker.

1402
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1403
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:33,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1404
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:36,980
 the way maker, the miracle worker.

1405
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1406
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:41,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1407
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:44,980
 the way maker, the miracle worker.

1408
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:47,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1409
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:50,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1410
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:53,980
 the way maker, the miracle worker.

1411
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:56,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1412
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:59,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1413
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:02,980
 the way maker, the miracle worker.

1414
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:05,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1415
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1416
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:10,980
 the way maker, the miracle worker.

1417
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,980
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

1418
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:16,980
 We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

1419
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:19,980

 Let's sing this. This is who we are.

1507
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:34,980
 This is who we are.

1508
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,980
 You are the salt.

1509
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:40,980
 You are the light on the hill.

1510
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:43,980

 We are the church.

1513
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,980
 We will always give glory to our Father

1514
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:55,980
 because He lives in us.

1515
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:57,980
 He is our life.

1516
01:29:57,980 --> 01:30:00,980
 He is our everything.

1517
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:03,980
 And so, Father,

1518
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:06,980
 we proclaim you in our lives.

1519
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:09,980
 And, Father, we just declare today

1520
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:12,980
 that we are your light.

1521
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:15,980
 We are your salt.

1522
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:18,980
 Church, I just want to pray over you.

1523
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:21,980
 I want to pray over us, that even on our worst days,

1524
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:24,980
 when you don't want to do anything,

1525
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:26,980
 you want to just lie in bed,

1526
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,980
 you just don't want to do anything, you don't want to see anyone,

1527
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:32,980
 you know what? You are still salt. You are still light.

1528
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:35,980
 And God is still at work, just as we're singing.

1529
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:38,980
 Even when I don't feel it, even when I don't see it,

1530
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:41,980
 you are working, Lord. And we say, "Yes, Lord, that is our hope."

1531
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:44,980
 Church, that is really our hope today.

1532
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,980
 And so I want to just bless you and release you

1533
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:50,980
 to know every moment you are shining.

1534
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:53,980
 You are bringing flavor.

1535
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:55,980
 You are proclaiming and pointing others to God's goodness

1536
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:58,980
 in you and in us, even though we don't feel that way.

1537
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:01,980
 We don't believe that all the time.

1538
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:04,980
 But the reality is, this is our reality now.

1539
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:07,980
 And so, Jesus, we thank you

1540
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:10,980
 that you call us a sinful, selfish people

1541
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,980
 to serve you, to love you,

1542
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:16,980
 to reveal you through us.

1543
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,980
 And you are changing us. You are transforming us.

1544
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,980
 We don't deserve it, but you are.

1545
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:24,980
 And we thank you for your mercy.

1546
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:27,980
 We thank you for your grace.

1547
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:30,980
 And so may we start in our homes.

1548
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:33,980
 May we start in our communities. May we start in our schools,

1549
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:36,980
 knowing that we are always going to be your salt and light.

1550
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:40,980
 So, Jesus, we thank you, and we go out in this joy, in this peace.

1551
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,980
 We're going to have lunch together today,

1552
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:47,980
 knowing and celebrating that this is our call.

1553
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:50,980
 So, Jesus, we thank you for meeting us today.

1554
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:53,980
 We thank you for your word.

1555
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:56,980
 We thank you that we can worship you today.

1556
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:59,980
 We thank you that for those of us who can serve today,

1557
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,980

1558
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:05,980
 So, Jesus, we remember you and lead us.

1559
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,980
 In your name we pray. Amen. Amen.

1560
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:11,980

1563
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:22,980
 So, right now, I just, yeah, just continue to get to know one another.

1564
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:25,980
 If you want to join us for lunch, go out, grab your lunch, come back.

1565
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:28,980
 Remember to pick up your kids.

 And remember, we'll see you guys next week for Vision Sunday.

1567
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:35,980
 If you would like prayer, I think we have a prayer team on the right-hand side here.

1568
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:38,980
 So, come up for prayer. If not, we'll see you soon.
