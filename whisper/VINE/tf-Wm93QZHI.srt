1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
 Thank you, Justin.

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,880
 That was amazing.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:17,040
 It's good to be with you this morning on this little cooler morning.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,880
 I am a Hong Konger.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:32,560
 Hong Kong is Sandra and I's adopted home and has been for the last 37 years.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,040
 Its people are my family.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:43,580
 My sons, their wives, and five grandchildren are also Hong Kongers.

8
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:51,280
 The grandchildren were all made in Hong Kong, well, to my knowledge anyway.

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,520
 They were born here, of that I can be sure.

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,040
 Don't be put off by my face.

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,440
 Yes, I am a guai lou.

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,160
 Don't be put off by my lack of Chinese.

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,560
 I don't speak Cantonese.

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,960
 Well, to be truthful, I speak a little Cantonese.

15
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,840
 I love Hong Kong.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:32,320
 Tim told us last week that it doesn't matter whether we are an expat, a local, a domestic

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,080
 helper, or an asylum seeker.

18
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:45,480
 It doesn't matter whether we are a street sleeper or we're chairman of HSBC.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,120
 This is home.

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,880
 And Tim used a famous passage in Jeremiah 29 to tell us.

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:03,480
 Yes, as he said, it does contain the famous 2911 fridge magnet bookmark photo frame verse.

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,440
 To seek the peace and prosperity of the city.

23
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,520
 He reminded us that this word of God was given to a people in exile.

24
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:28,880
 The Israelites who spent 70 years, yes, 70 years as strangers and aliens in Babylon.

25
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:36,720
 Tim used this to challenge us to become engaged in our city.

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,640
 But there was no excuse for apathetic disengagement.

27
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:53,720
 But if that was the what, today I want to look at the how.

28
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,840
 How can I as an expat, a domestic helper, asylum seeker, street sleeper, or chairman

29
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:10,320
 of HSBC, how can I as a member of Vine, Yuen Long, contribute, contribute to the peace

30
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,520
 and prosperity of our city?

31
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:22,680
 You see, whereas in the first message we looked at how we relate to Hong Kong and Yuen Long

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:30,600
 from a big picture perspective, this time we want to look in more detail.

33
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:40,000
 What does it actually mean to love the place we're in and to work for its welfare and peace?

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,920
 More especially, how can we use the church's resources, our faith resources to bring flourishing

35
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,080
 to Yuen Long?

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,080
 How can we use our difference to serve people?

37
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:04,880
 Today we will think about our spheres of influence and how we can contribute to the flourishing

38
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:17,200
 and well-being of Yuen Long and its people so that people will see our good work and

39
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
 praise God in heaven.

40
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,560
 And I'll tell you something.

41
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,840
 I'm going to make it simple.

42
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,520
 So embarrassingly simple.

43
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,200
 To demonstrate, I'm turning to two household items.

44
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,800
 They're actually all in this one thing.

45
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,040
 How can you talk about salt and light and have it in one thing?

46
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
 Look at that.

47
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
 Salt and light.

48
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
 Press it again.

49
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:59,120
 Yes.

50
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,320
 Salt and light.

51
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,320
 It's for you, Byron.

52
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
 Let's look at scripture.

53
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,920
 Let's turn to Matthew 5.

54
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,720
 Let's start at verse 13.

55
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
 You.

56
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
 Yes, you.

57
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
 You.

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,820
 Yes, you.

59
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,740
 You are the salt of the earth.

60
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,780
 But if salt's lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?

61
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:38,540
 It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's

62
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,800
 feet.

63
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,180
 You are the light of the world.

64
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:52,160
 A city set on a hill cannot be hidden, nor do people light a lamp and put it under a

65
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,880
 basket but on a stand so it gives light to all the house.

66
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:08,240
 In the same way, let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works

67
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,540
 and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.

68
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,540
 Let me start by giving you some background.

69
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,320
 This section is from the Sermon on the Mount.

70
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,820
 Matthew 5, 6, 7.

71
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,940
 Amazing chapters.

72
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:38,400
 Jesus' audiences were the disciples of Jesus and the crowd who were the future disciples

73
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
 of Jesus.

74
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:48,280
 And what they were doing, they were weighing the cost of following Jesus.

75
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,980
 And the background to my teaching this morning can be found in Jesus' teaching in the Sermon

76
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,200
 on the Mount.

77
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:03,560
 And particularly his teaching on the Kingdom of God also described as the Kingdom of Heaven.

78
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,960
 Jesus had told them in Matthew 4 that repentance is the key to entering the Kingdom of Heaven.

79
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,320
 I've put it on the screen.

80
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:22,160
 From that time, Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."

81
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:32,040
 As the Sermon on the Mount continues, Jesus answers the important question, "Who can enter

82
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,400
 the Kingdom of Heaven?

83
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,800
 Who can enter the Kingdom of God?"

84
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,320
 He answers it with what we call the Beatitudes.

85
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,040
 I heard that Billy Graham had actually called them "beautiful attitudes."

86
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,000
 I love that.

87
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,240
 I heard a story of a Chinese Christian who came to a missionary one time and said, "I've

88
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,480
 learned to quote the Sermon on the Mount by memory."

89
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:06,200
 He stood before the missionary and perfectly quoted the sermon word for word.

90
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,520
 The missionary said, "That's wonderful.

91
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,680
 How did you do it?"

92
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:19,720
 The Chinese Christian said this, "I spent the last year trying to live it."

93
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:26,920
 Matthew 5, 3 to 6 tells us, "It is the poor and spirit, those who mourn, the meek, those

94
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,880
 who hunger and thirst for righteousness who can enter the Kingdom of God."

95
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,640
 In verses 7 to 9, he then describes the attitude of a Kingdom person as merciful, pure in heart,

96
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,520
 a peacemaker.

97
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,560
 We are told we will be called children of God.

98
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,920
 All this seems good.

99
00:08:50,920 --> 00:09:01,960
 But Matthew 5, 11 tells us how the world, how the world out there treats a Kingdom citizen.

100
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:13,960
 Jesus said we will be insulted, persecuted, falsely bad-mouthed, but that we will be blessed.

101
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,480
 Jesus then takes it a stage further.

102
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,800
 I put this one on the screen.

103
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:25,560
 Matthew 5, 12, "Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven.

104
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,320
 For in the same way, they persecuted the prophets who were before you."

105
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:38,160
 My friends, we are citizens of heaven.

106
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,760
 We are ambassadors of Christ.

107
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,200
 We are heirs of the Kingdom of God.

108
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:53,280
 That is because of the work of Jesus on the cross and our faith and belief in Jesus.

109
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,080
 And this brings us to our message for today.

110
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,400
 How can I, as a member of Vine, Ewan Long, how can I, as a citizen of heaven, an ambassador

111
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,400
 for Christ, an heir of the Kingdom of God, contribute to the peace and prosperity of

112
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,600
 our city?

113
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:29,520
 I will tell you in 14 words, you are the salt of the earth.

114
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,960
 You are the light of the world.

115
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,800
 You are salt and light.

116
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,440
 This is about our identity in Jesus.

117
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,200
 It's not about you trying to be something.

118
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:02,500
 But it's about what you are, what you already are in Jesus and in his Kingdom.

119
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:09,580
 The beauty of the gospel is that God makes us his people.

120
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,620
 And he gives us a new identity and a new purpose.

121
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:20,620
 And God calls us to figure out how to work out that identity in the world.

122
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,460
 So our identity is in Christ.

123
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:33,220
 Christ, who is the salt of the earth and the light of the world.

124
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:41,220
 And we, in our identity, become that in the world.

125
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,340
 Jesus told his disciples that despite the difficulties, despite the persecution, you

126
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,940
 are to be the salt and light of the world.

127
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,200
 When times are tough, we tend to quit.

128
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,100
 We tend to withdraw into our shell.

129
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,220
 We tend to go into our small community and be self-sufficient.

130
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,740
 Jesus said no.

131
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,220
 The citizens of my Kingdom have an important role to play in this world.

132
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,420
 Contributing to the peace of our city.

133
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:25,500
 Even in a world where there can be things that are against our principles and ethics.

134
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:35,820
 Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to be like salt and light in the world.

135
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,300
 So let's see this passage in two parts.

136
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,460
 The first one is salt.

137
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,840
 I repeat Matthew 13.

138
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,000
 You are the salt of the earth.

139
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,500
 But if salt has lost its taste, how should its saltiness be restored?

140
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,540
 It's no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's

141
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,700
 feet.

142
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,380
 You are the salt of the earth.

143
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,420
 The first metaphor that Jesus uses for our connection with the world or our engagement

144
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,060
 with the world is that we are to be salt.

145
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:22,820
 Salt has been used by humanity for over 6,000 years.

146
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,420
 What was the idea of salt in the thinking of the ancient world?

147
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,700
 Well, salt was a very valuable commodity in the ancient world.

148
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,940
 It was like money.

149
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:40,020
 There are records that sometimes in some places, Roman soldiers might receive their pay, their

150
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,020
 wages, their salary in salt.

151
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,860
 That's where the word salary comes from, see?

152
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,860
 Salt.

153
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:56,340
 You go to a pay table and they give you a little pouch with a salt.

154
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:03,740
 That's how valuable and sellable salt was in the ancient world.

155
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,220
 I can think of three major uses of salt.

156
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:17,500
 For as a preservative agent, as a flavoring agent, and as a healing agent.

157
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,180
 Let's take them one at a time.

158
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,540
 Firstly a preserving agent.

159
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:31,980
 In the ancient world and even today, salt is used to preserve meat.

160
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:38,580
 Salted meat and fish became a necessity in the day before the refrigerator was invented.

161
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,660
 The refrigerator is only 200 years old, right?

162
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:48,780
 The very basic way is that you could pack it with salt and dry it up so that you could

163
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,300
 preserve the meat.

164
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:58,460
 And the idea behind salt is very much about preserving influence.

165
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:06,140
 Christians are to serve as a preserving influence in the world against decay.

166
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,500
 That's what Jesus is saying to his disciples.

167
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,900
 You are to be like a preservative in the world.

168
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:22,060
 If the world around you is wicked, arrogant, and sinful, the believers in its midst must

169
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:28,940
 act like a preservative and make it slow down in its progress to decay.

170
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:36,740
 We should make the world better.

171
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,820
 There's something distinct about us.

172
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:48,940
 God's goodness in us protects us against the decay of the world.

173
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:56,920
 At the cross, Jesus defeated death and the system of the world.

174
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,620
 Now we become a preserving factor for goodness.

175
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,260
 I mean, take a look around you.

176
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:15,300
 Do you see the growing trend towards dishonesty, corruption, immorality, violence, pornography,

177
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,580
 and the diminishing respect for human life?

178
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,660
 Whose fault is it?

179
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,900
 Let me put it this way.

180
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,940
 If meat goes bad, there's no point in blaming the meat.

181
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,660
 That is what happens when bacteria are allowed to breed unchecked.

182
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:42,940
 The question to ask is, where is the salt?

183
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:51,860
 My question to you this morning, where is the salt?

184
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,460
 Salt is also a flavoring agent.

185
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,100
 Salt is used to season our food.

186
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,520
 Some of you, I've seen you.

187
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,460
 You love your salt like anything.

188
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:11,460
 I see people salt their food before they even taste it, right?

189
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,220
 I'm British, right?

190
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,140
 We love fish and chips.

191
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,780
 But the best bit of fish and chips is actually the salt and the vinegar.

192
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,540
 Of course.

193
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,660
 Salt greatly enhances the flavor of the food.

194
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,860
 We're supposed to be there to make society better.

195
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,540
 The world is supposed to be better because of the fact that the disciples of Jesus are

196
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,720
 in it.

197
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,680
 Sometimes the world doesn't understand that.

198
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,340
 It often persecutes believers.

199
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:52,340
 My friends, there is no area of your life that Jesus doesn't come into.

200
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:58,020
 He comes into your personal life, your family life, your professional life, your relationship

201
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:06,160
 with others, and in all those relationships, you are a preservative against corruption

202
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,340
 of the world.

203
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:14,580
 You must be a flavoring in your workplace.

204
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,460
 You must be a flavoring in your schools and colleges.

205
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,500
 Christians must be the salt in hospitals and other workplaces.

206
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,900
 But lastly, salt is a healing agent.

207
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,420
 Universally, salt is seen as a healing agent.

208
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:40,420
 The use of salt and salt water can be traced right the way back to Greeks, Romans, and

209
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:47,500
 Egyptians, all of whom used it to treat cuts, wounds, and skin irritations.

210
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:56,180
 Today, thousands of years later, a concentrated form of salt water is called saline, right,

211
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,180
 and is routinely used in medical.

212
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,180
 Saline is sterile.

213
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,980
 Oh, there's so much hurt, you know.

214
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,820
 Distrust in our world today.

215
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,340
 Our world is polarized, right?

216
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,700
 Democrats or Republicans.

217
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
 Even here, right?

218
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,260
 Yellows and blues.

219
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:27,940
 Even in churches, division between Protestants and Catholics.

220
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,500
 Local and international churches.

221
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,020
 Denominations.

222
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,700
 Charismatics and evangelicals.

223
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,020
 Whatever those words mean.

224
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,380
 I want to make a declaration today.

225
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,700
 I'm declaring it over this church.

226
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,900
 I declare that the Vine Yuen Long is a bridge-building community.

227
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,660
 Can I hear amen?

228
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,980
 A terror down of walls.

229
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,820
 God's healing agent.

230
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,140
 Salt.

231
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:08,980
 We serve as the preserving agent, the flavoring agent, and the healing agent to the world.

232
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,780
 Now, let's move from salt to light.

233
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,540
 It's interesting.

234
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,980
 We are the light of the world.

235
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,500
 Go right to the beginning of your Bible.

236
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,300
 People don't carry Bibles so much these days.

237
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,780
 Go right to the beginning.

238
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,100
 Genesis chapter 1.

239
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,860
 I want my iPhone to say Genesis 1.

240
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,860
 In the beginning.

241
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,340
 All right, first words.

242
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,340
 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

243
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,900
 Now the earth was formless and empty.

244
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,260
 Darkness was over the surface of the deep.

245
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,140
 And the spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

246
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,060
 And God said, the first thing we see recorded that God said was this.

247
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,940
 Let there be light.

248
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,940
 And there was light.

249
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,140
 And God saw that the light was good.

250
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,860
 And he separated the light from the darkness.

251
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,380
 Can I read some more verses to show you where I'm heading with this?

252
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,820
 2 Corinthians 4.

253
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,820
 6.

254
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,100
 For God said, let your light shine out of darkness.

255
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:22,340
 Made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory

256
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,540
 displayed in the face of Christ.

257
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
 1 John 1.5.

258
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,900
 God is light.

259
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,940
 In him there is no darkness at all.

260
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,220
 And then Jesus in 8.12 said this.

261
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,380
 I am the light of the world.

262
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,140
 One of the seven I am's, right?

263
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,700
 I am the light of the world.

264
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,580
 So God is the light.

265
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,700
 Jesus is the light of the world.

266
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,900
 Now Jesus looks at his followers.

267
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,340
 He looks at you.

268
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,460
 You are the light of the world.

269
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,980
 Jesus is saying just like I shine in the world, now I want you to shine in the world.

270
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:11,260
 And Matthew 5.14 which we read earlier, you are the light of the world.

271
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,580
 Believers are the light of the world.

272
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,820
 This is hard to imagine.

273
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,820
 Like Jesus said these seven I am's, right?

274
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,540
 But the only I am that he said you are is light.

275
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,460
 Jesus doesn't say hey, Kieran, you're the good shepherd.

276
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,380
 Or you're the way, the truth, and the life.

277
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,700
 But he does say I am the light of the world.

278
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,300
 And he then says you are the light of the world.

279
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,380
 This is a great compliment.

280
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,780
 But also a great responsibility.

281
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:55,340
 That is a powerful declaration of the individual worth and mission of every believer.

282
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,300
 Can we just stop and reflect on that a moment?

283
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,300
 It's so important.

284
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,340
 Jesus who said I am the light of the world.

285
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,500
 Then says Chapman, you are the light of the world.

286
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,300
 That's a responsibility and a privilege, I tell you.

287
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,900
 Light is visibility and radiance.

288
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,420
 Let's go back on these verses again.

289
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,420
 You are the light of the world.

290
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,500
 A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.

291
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,060
 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.

292
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,220
 Instead they put it in the stand and it gives light to everyone in the house.

293
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:46,420
 In the same way, let your light shine before others that they might see your good deeds

294
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,700
 and glorify your father in heaven.

295
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,100
 Just four things in that verse.

296
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,220
 We are the light of the world.

297
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,340
 We are a city on a hill.

298
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,460
 We are to be visible.

299
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:04,660
 And our visibility is done by action, good deeds.

300
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:11,220
 To come into the light means to come out of hiding.

301
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,940
 We are to be visible in society with the light of our Lord Jesus Christ.

302
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,020
 The light is the gospel.

303
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,900
 The gospel has to radiate from our lives.

304
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:29,620
 When your light shines, some will accept and turn to the father, but some will reject us.

305
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:37,060
 But if we're neutral, something is wrong with our Christian effectiveness.

306
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,980
 Our good deeds must radiate from us.

307
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:48,460
 What great responsibility has been given to us.

308
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:55,860
 There is not another light that Jesus is shining in the world.

309
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,540
 You, you are the light of the world.

310
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,780
 Jesus said, I want you to be my light.

311
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,580
 I want you to be my instrument.

312
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,900
 You are like my body, my hands and my mouth and my feet on this earth.

313
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,340
 You are the light of the world.

314
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,620
 And we are called to keep that light burning.

315
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,540
 I mean, think about life in Jesus' time.

316
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,460
 They didn't have any artificial light like we do today, right?

317
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,420
 You know, they had oil lamps.

318
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,060
 You know, every house had an oil lamp.

319
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,860
 And these are the kind of lights that Jesus is talking about.

320
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,900
 You are the light of the world.

321
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,460
 Now, individually, one of these might not be too bright.

322
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:47,020
 But vine yun long.

323
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:54,420
 I believe together, together, we can light up the entire area.

324
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:01,820
 Oil is a biblical symbol of the Holy Spirit.

325
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,980
 We are to be like the wise bridesmaids who

326
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:12,380
 had their lamps full, full of oil and full of the Holy Spirit,

327
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,660
 rather than the foolish ones.

328
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,460
 But as I draw towards a conclusion,

329
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,260
 I need to ask you a hard question.

330
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,700
 I'm going to be straight with you.

331
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,820
 If we truly wish to contribute to the peace of our city,

332
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,140
 are we living as the sword of the earth

333
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,140
 and the light of the world?

334
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,580
 Or are we living just like the world?

335
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,380
 Living in sin, living in flesh.

336
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,660
 I'm not judging, by the way.

337
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:52,540
 And the good news is that we can repent and ask for forgiveness.

338
00:26:52,540 --> 00:27:03,340
 But given this chance in 2024, let us commit.

339
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,980
 Let's commit together that the Vine Church, yun long,

340
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,940
 will be holy, will be separated, and be life and salt.

341
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,820
 I will pray for that for us for in a moment.

342
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:23,660
 And I want to end on a positive note.

343
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:30,380
 Some things that we can do to be salt and light.

344
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:36,620
 And the first one is this, share your faith in Christ.

345
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,940
 One of the most powerful evangelism tools you have

346
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,900
 is your personal story of coming to faith in Christ.

347
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:53,860
 What I was like before, how I met Christ, and the difference

348
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,220
 he's made to my life.

349
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,860
 Now, unbelievers may not be interested in discussing

350
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,820
 Bible verses or spiritual doctrines.

351
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,020
 But they will likely be willing to hear your story.

352
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,940
 Look for a point of connection with your colleague,

353
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,260
 your friend, or neighbor, and share about the difference

354
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,820
 that Christ has made in your life.

355
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,540
 No one can argue with that.

356
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:32,020
 For the more shy, can I encourage you?

357
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,180
 It's not about preaching.

358
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,180
 Some words which were wrongly attributed

359
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,340
 to Francis of Assisi said preach the gospel

360
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,140
 at all times.

361
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,500
 Use words if necessary.

362
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:51,860
 My personal story is that I actually

363
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,420
 reached more people for Christ when

364
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:01,340
 I was in the insurance business than I do as a pastor.

365
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,380
 You see, I spend most of my time now with Christians.

366
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,260
 But I didn't stand on my desk and preach a sermon.

367
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,860
 I didn't give out tracts and text the whole time

368
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,780
 or invite them to church every five minutes.

369
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,060
 No.

370
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,900
 But they knew that my door was always open to them.

371
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,620
 It was the way I treated them.

372
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,100
 The smile.

373
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,060
 Let's have a practice.

374
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,500
 [LAUGHTER]

375
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:44,060
 The words of encouragement.

376
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:49,300
 That supportive text or email-- very easy to do, right?

377
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,780
 That offer to pray for them when they were

378
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,980
 going through a tough time.

379
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,300
 It's funny, though.

380
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,820
 Sometimes on the side there, I should say,

381
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,020
 I'll pray for you about that.

382
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,540
 They say, oh, yes, yes, yes.

383
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,980
 And they're thinking I'm going to pray for them

384
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,700
 when I get home.

385
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,860
 And I say, come on, then.

386
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,060
 Let's pray.

387
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,300
 We can all do that.

388
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:16,300
 Second thing is take your light where it's dark.

389
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,540
 A young girl once consulted with her pastor.

390
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,980
 She said, I can't stick it out any longer.

391
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,420
 I'm the only Christian in my company where I work.

392
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,700
 I get nothing but taunts and sneers.

393
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,380
 It's more than I can stand.

394
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,180
 I'm going to resign.

395
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:38,620
 The pastor said, will you tell me where lights are placed?

396
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,860
 She said, what's this got to do with it?

397
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,460
 Never mind, the pastor said.

398
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,180
 Answer my question.

399
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,100
 Where are lights placed?

400
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,220
 I suppose, she said, in dark places.

401
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,060
 He said, yes.

402
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,300
 And that's why you have been put in a company

403
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,580
 with such spiritual darkness and where

404
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,940
 there is no other Christian to shine for the Lord.

405
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,020
 The young Christian realized for the first time

406
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,380
 the opportunity that was hers.

407
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,940
 She felt that she could not fail God by allowing

408
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,300
 her light to go out.

409
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,780
 She went back to the factory, to the office,

410
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,020
 with renewed determination to let her light

411
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,980
 shine in a dark corner.

412
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,620
 And before long, she was the means

413
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,780
 of leading nine other girls to the Lord.

414
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:37,820
 And lastly, shine together as the torch.

415
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,340
 If we were to turn the lights out here today,

416
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,540
 and it was in darkness, and I got my iPhone out and put

417
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,820
 my torch on, that would be light in the darkness,

418
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,220
 but it wouldn't be very powerful.

419
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,660
 If we were all to take our iPhones out and all

420
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,980
 put our torches on--

421
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,260
 sorry, I didn't mean to advertise for Apple.

422
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,940
 If we would take our smartphones out,

423
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,180
 if we would take our smartphones out and all put our torch on,

424
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,820
 it would make a difference.

425
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,820
 That is such a picture.

426
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,860
 What strikes me about Vian Yuen Long

427
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,340
 and why Sandra and I love coming here is this.

428
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,300
 You are a community.

429
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,660
 You are a community.

430
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:33,420
 And the word unity is a big part of community.

431
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:42,300
 Let us resolve to shine our torches together.

432
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,620
 That the lights are on at Vian Yuen Long 24/7.

433
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,540
 I'm not talking about Huggs, John Lee building.

434
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,660
 The election bill would be rather pathetic.

435
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:56,180
 But our lights are on 24/7.

436
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,460
 Let us commit to being salt and light.

437
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,220
 I believe that this is the key to contributing

438
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,180
 to the peace and the prosperity of our city.

439
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:16,220
 As I close, I believe there will be

440
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,260
 a number of significant shifts.

441
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:24,500
 I see this prophetically.

442
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,580
 And please weigh this up.

443
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,420
 I see a spiritual earthquake.

444
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:37,460
 In the natural, as what are called tectonic plates

445
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,020
 interact with each other, energy is

446
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:46,500
 released as seismic waves causing the ground to shake.

447
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,700
 This is an earthquake.

448
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,820
 I see a spiritual earthquake.

449
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,540
 And in this spiritual earthquake,

450
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,220
 I believe we'll see the following.

451
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:11,980
 Firstly, we will see service, not selfishness.

452
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,260
 Can I repeat that?

453
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:15,760
 Service.

454
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,420
 Oh, pastor, I'm leaving the church.

455
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,940
 I'm not getting fed.

456
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,580
 You heard that so many times, right?

457
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,660
 All about me, me, me, me, me.

458
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,420
 Selfishness.

459
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:33,420
 Service, not selfishness.

460
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,740
 Living our lives for each other and the community at large,

461
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,340
 at the expense of worrying about our own individual needs,

462
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,660
 or even the needs of just our church.

463
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,180
 Philippians 2, 3 says this.

464
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,220
 Be humble.

465
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:56,700
 Thinking of others as better than ourselves.

466
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,500
 I believe we will see as part of this spiritual earthquake

467
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,820
 a healed community, a healed community,

468
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:13,020
 to show how ethnic, political, generational separation

469
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,500
 and division can be healed in this community.

470
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,100
 Look at us.

471
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,820
 Just take a look around the church.

472
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,020
 We're a diverse bunch.

473
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:35,660
 Different races, different color faces, different backgrounds,

474
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,620
 different first languages.

475
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:43,420
 In a world that is divided, with societies and families becoming

476
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:50,940
 even more polarized, we can become a major contribution

477
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,100
 in the unity part of our community.

478
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:01,620
 And lastly, we will be carriers of hope.

479
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,620
 Carriers of hope.

480
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,060
 I mean, just read your newspapers.

481
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,140
 Hope seems nowhere to be found these days.

482
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:19,660
 Instead of cynicism and despair, we carry real hope,

483
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,060
 even in the midst of disorientation,

484
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,180
 even in the midst of pain in our city.

485
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,700
 Tim called it out last week.

486
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,500
 He stated it clearly.

487
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,940
 Fear.

488
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:39,420
 Fear has become a giant in our city.

489
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:47,260
 And its people are gripped by it and are desperately

490
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,300
 lacking in hope, especially our young people.

491
00:36:51,300 --> 00:37:01,940
 Our contribution is hope because of what the Bible describes

492
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,740
 as Christ in you, the hope of glory.

493
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,260
 We are the hope for this city because Christ

494
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,900
 is the hope for our city.

495
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,900
 And we just don't take care of our own tribe.

496
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,780
 We also do work for the peace, the security, the justice,

497
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,380
 and the prosperity of our neighbors,

498
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:32,100
 loving them in word and deed, whether or not

499
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:37,420
 they believe the same thing as we believe.

500
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:42,140
 Vine, you're love.

501
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,820
 I bless you.

502
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,820
 I bless you to be salt and to be light.

503
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,660
 Would you stand up?

504
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,700
 I'd love to pray for you as the band comes back.

505
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,140
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

506
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:14,060
 Will you just put your hands out in front of you, please?

507
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,700
 This is not a religious thing that we do.

508
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,740
 It's just to say to God, I'm open to what you have.

509
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,940
 I think the word that came pretty early on in there,

510
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,700
 and I've got to deal with it, is repent.

511
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,180
 We're all sinners.

512
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:37,180
 And before we talk about going out to the world out there

513
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,220
 and doing all these wonderful things,

514
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,780
 let's just come before God.

515
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,620
 Say, Jesus Christ, I believe you're the Son of God.

516
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,580
 Jesus Christ, I believe you died for my sins.

517
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,140
 Jesus, forgive my sins and come into my life

518
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,980
 by your Holy Spirit.

519
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:02,340
 Lord, I choose today to repent of all my wrongdoings,

520
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,860
 my wrong attitudes, my biases towards people.

521
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:14,820
 Forgive me, Lord, and use me.

522
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:24,620
 And Lord, together, Lord, we ask for an anointing

523
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,980
 to be upon this church, a fresh anointing.

524
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:36,420
 Hong Kong doesn't need another church.

525
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,700
 There are plenty of churches in Hong Kong.

526
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,020
 But Hong Kong and Yuen Long in this area

527
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,300
 needs a church who are willing to be salt and light for him.

528
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:52,220
 My friend, that's a sacrifice.

529
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:57,980
 I know when you go home today, yeah,

530
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,460
 say that was a good sermon, it tickles your ear,

531
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,900
 and you get on with life, and you live life as normal.

532
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,780
 Being salt and light means living differently.

533
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:13,820
 Being salt and light means having different priorities.

534
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,980
 It means treating people differently.

535
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,940
 For some of you, it means looking at your workplace

536
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,460
 colleagues differently, your neighbors.

537
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:37,380
 Holy Spirit, think of that old song,

538
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,780
 "Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning."

539
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,260
 That's what I want to pray, Lord,

540
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,500
 that you would fill our lamps with oil

541
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,340
 and keep them burning bright for you.

542
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:56,100
 I confess, Lord, I want to be salt and light,

543
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,740
 but so many times, Lord, I fail you.

544
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:11,260
 Lord, I pray today that you will help me,

545
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,420
 help me to be salt and light.

546
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:21,220
 I wonder if you'd just join hands across the congregation.

547
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,620
 I want to pray for us together.

548
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,820
 Just join hands together if we can.

549
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,660
 Because I believe this is something

550
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,740
 we need to pray for collectively.

551
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:44,060
 Vying Yuen Long is just not to be an alternative place

552
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,340
 to come to on a Sunday morning

553
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,940
 because one shy is too far on the MTR.

554
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:54,860
 God has ordained this place for a purpose,

555
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,420
 to be salt and light in this community.

556
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,540
 But we have to do this together.

557
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:08,260
 Join us together, Lord, as your people.

558
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:15,260
 We pray now for the people of Yuen Long.

559
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,220
 We pray now for the people of Hong Kong.

560
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,900
 Help us collectively, Lord,

561
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:32,100
 to be used by you and for your glory.

562
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,580
 Holy Spirit.

563
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,340
 And I just see the Holy Spirit just --

564
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,500
 this is like an electric current as we're going around.

565
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,700
 We're joined together.

566
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,980
 Holy Spirit just flowing through us,

567
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:50,940
 flowing for you onto the person next to you and vice versa.

568
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,460
 Holy Spirit, come.

569
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,020
 Fill me afresh.

570
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,180
 I surrender to you now.

571
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:04,100
 Use me for your glory, Lord, to be salt and light.

572
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:11,940
 We pray this, and, Lord, we declare

573
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:18,340
 that you are the waymaker, the miracle worker.

574
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,060
 Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.

575
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,060
 We pray this.

576
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,060
 [music]

577
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:36,140
 Start to sing, "You are here moving in this place."

578
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,140
 Come on.

579
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,140
 Let's go straight into worship.

580
