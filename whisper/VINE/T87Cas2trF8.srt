1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 Have a seat, have a seat.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,240
 I'm so grateful that I can be with you here on my final Sunday with you before sabbatical.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,000
 I was supposed to be preaching out of Ephesians today and continuing our series in Ephesians,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,540
 and that was the schedule for this Sunday.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,240
 But over the last few weeks as I've just been processing my heart to get ready to go on

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,120
 the four-month break that I have, I've just felt like a rising sense in me that I have

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,480
 a message that I want to impart into you as a community before I go.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,600
 And it's one that I know that the Holy Spirit is currently imparting into me.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,560
 It's something that I feel like the Spirit of God is shaping in me.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,240
 And while this is not always the case, I've recognized over the last 11 years of leading

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,640
 here that when the Holy Spirit does something for me, he'll often also do it for us as a

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,160
 community.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,280
 And so I want to speak a little bit out of what I'm sensing God is calling me into sabbatical

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
 four.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,440
 I actually am entering into my sabbatical with a lot of energy.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,560
 I'm not collapsing over the finish line as if I've done this massive marathon and I need

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,960
 someone to kind of pump some sort of energy into me.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,080
 I'm actually going on the sabbatical with a lot of spiritual energy, a lot of leadership

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,680
 energy, a lot of excitement, which is a great thing.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,520
 But I also recognize I'm heading on to sabbatical because there is some healing I need.

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,640
 There is some inner healing and restoration that I need for me.

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,840
 And I know that in order for me to lead how I sense the Holy Spirit is calling me and

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,560
 wanting me to lead here, I need to make sure I've got regular rhythms in my life, not just

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,520
 sabbatical times, but regular rhythms to get healing from the Holy Spirit.

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,400
 But now in this season of my life, I know I need that healing perhaps now more than

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
 ever.

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,000
 And I feel that cool as I go into sabbatical.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,480
 And I want to share a little bit with you today out of that place because I sense that

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,320
 there is many of us here in this room, in the overflow online right now, who are also

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,360
 in need of what we've really seen Paul teach in the book of Ephesians.

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,760
 And that is a journey of inner healing and restoration.

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,160
 And it's been amazing over the weeks as we've seen Paul's pastoral heart for his church

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,160
 in Ephesus.

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,200
 And a few weeks back, we saw that prayer at the end of chapter three, where he says, "My

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,360
 prayer for you is that you would be strengthened with power by the Spirit in your inner being."

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,640
 And it's this pastoral moment where Paul is standing before his church and he's saying,

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,280
 "Man, this is my heart.

38
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,040
 My heart is that the Spirit of God would come and do a healing, regenerative, restorative

39
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,640
 work within you, create power where there is currently weakness."

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,600
 And as I head into my sabbatical, I almost feel like God's got like a little rope around

41
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,960
 me and he's kind of gently doing this.

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,400
 And he's saying, "I need you once again to get strengthened with power by my Spirit in

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,240
 your inner being, because I need to release some things out of you.

44
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,920
 I need to heal and restore some things in you.

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,360
 And I feel that call for you here this morning."

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,440
 And so I put aside what I was supposed to be doing and I want to bring a message that

47
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,520
 hopefully will not only help you to understand what's happening for me, but perhaps more

48
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,800
 importantly, help you to understand what the Holy Spirit wants to do for you.

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,600
 This is a year of intimacy.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,640
 We've said here at the Vine in 2024.

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,340
 Intimacy is always not just about coming into closer relationship with Christ or sensing

52
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,460
 his presence in our lives more.

53
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,040
 Intimacy is always about inner healing and restoration.

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,280
 It's always about coming in so that we can be restored to then go out again.

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,240
 And I pray that what I share with you today will be a part of that journey in your life.

56
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,960
 A number of months ago, I got a phone call from an old high school friend of mine here

57
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,560
 in Hong Kong.

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,640
 We had been in the same high school year group back in Hong Kong for seven years at South

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,200
 Island School.

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,120
 And so we'd kind of grown up together.

61
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,260
 We weren't like the closest of friends in high school, but we were in the same year

62
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,200
 group and we had both lived in Hong Kong post-graduation.

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,500
 And so I had stayed in touch with her here and there and I'd seen her here and there,

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,760
 but her calling me out of the blue was a surprise.

65
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,920
 And so of course I answered the phone.

66
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,880
 And as I was talking to her, she explained to me that the reason why she was calling

67
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,560
 was because her father had just passed away.

68
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,800
 And she wanted to know whether I would be willing to do the funeral, to help with the

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,480
 funeral, which was of course an incredible privilege to be invited into one of my very

70
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,280
 old school friends' lives in a time of great grief and mourning to help them to walk into

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
 this kind of memorial funeral time.

72
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,480
 And I remember though, as we were talking about this, I remember thinking to myself,

73
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,600
 I don't think this family is from a place of faith.

74
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,440
 Not that that would necessarily stop me from wanting to do this, but I was curious as to

75
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,420
 why she had asked me to do it.

76
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,760
 And so I raised this, that I thought that they were perhaps a family that were not churched

77
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,540
 or from the faith tradition.

78
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,540
 And she said, "Yeah, absolutely."

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,440
 And she said, "In fact, my father was a staunch atheist, a strong atheist for the majority

80
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
 of his life.

81
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,680
 And one of the things that he loved to do most at the end of his life, in the last few

82
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,760
 years of his life, is to debate with Christians to prove them that they're stupid in their

83
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,500
 beliefs.

84
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,040
 And you want me to do the memorial, right?"

85
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,640
 So this is kind of an interesting context, right?

86
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,760
 But I sensed her heart.

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,080
 She didn't know anybody in church.

88
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,200
 She didn't know really many Christians in her life, but she remembered me that I was

89
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
 a pastor.

90
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,400
 And she gave me a call and said, "Hey, I would love you to do this."

91
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,280
 And of course, I was like, "Absolutely.

92
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,840
 I would love to serve you and your family at this time of grief."

93
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
 She said, "Great.

94
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,280
 Well, maybe in a couple of weeks' time, we can meet face to face just a few days before

95
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,320
 the funeral, and we can firm up the rundown and everything like that."

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,400
 And I'm like, "Yep, great."

97
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:03,000
 So two weeks later, we met here at the Vine, and something absolutely fascinating had occurred

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,560
 between that first phone call and meeting her here in the building.

99
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,400
 Her father had been raised from the dead.

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,480
 No, that's a lie.

101
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
 I just made that up.

102
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
 That didn't happen.

103
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:21,360
 I just wanted to see how you would react.

104
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
 I'm going on sabbatical.

105
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,040
 I can play with you a little bit.

106
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,000
 That's fine.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,040
 But no, but something fascinating had happened.

108
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,880
 So in that two weeks between when I had first spoken to her and we met, she'd been going

109
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,440
 through her father's possessions, and she had discovered in the possessions a handwritten

110
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
 note.

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,120
 And because of the way it was written and the date on the back, she knew that he had

112
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,040
 written it just a month before he had passed away.

113
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,480
 Now it was rare for him to write anything down, particularly to write a handwritten

114
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,560
 kind of note like this.

115
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,040
 And when she looked at it, even though she is not from a faith background, she thought

116
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,480
 that what she was reading was potentially a quote from the Bible.

117
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,840
 And so she showed it to me as we met, and I want to show you a photo of it.

118
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,320
 I took a photo of it here, and it's from 1 Chronicles 4.

119
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,720
 Let me read this to you.

120
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,840
 "Oh, that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory, that your hand would be with

121
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,540
 me and that you would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain."

122
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,680
 So I read this note, and although I've been a pastor for many years, and although I would

123
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,120
 say I probably have an above-average understanding of the Bible and its narrative, I really didn't

124
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,960
 recognize this prayer.

125
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,720
 I wonder if any of you in the room recognize it.

126
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,720
 If you did, well done.

127
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,880
 I did not.

128
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,720
 So I had actually opened my Bible and go into the Bible, and then I realized, "Ah, this

129
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,120
 is the famous Prayer of Jabez."

130
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,200
 Has anyone ever heard of the Prayer of Jabez before?

131
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,440
 If you're older here, chances are you have, because this little prayer was actually made

132
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,640
 famous about 24 years ago when Bruce Wilkinson, a pastor, wrote a short little book called

133
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,960
 The Prayer of Jabez.

134
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,560
 And in the intro of the book, he actually said this.

135
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,380
 He said, "If you pray this prayer once a day for 30 days, then you can expect that God

136
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,800
 is going to bless you, He's going to enlarge your territory, He's going to enable you to

137
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,160
 have more influence."

138
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,320
 And this book sold like wildfire.

139
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,400
 Because let's face it, all of us want that magical prayer, don't we?

140
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,000
 That one thing that we could pray, if we could pray that 30 days, my whole life would be

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,640
 changed and I would have more influence and more power and more material goods, and God

142
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
 has blessed me.

143
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,720
 And this was the classic kind of name it and claim it book, and it flew off the shelves.

144
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:50,020
 In fact, to this day, it remains one of the only five Christian books that have sold more

145
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,460
 than 10 million copies in the US alone.

146
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,920
 Go into any church, go into pretty much any Christian bookstore anywhere in the world,

147
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,680
 you will see a copy of this book, The Prayer of Jabez.

148
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,160
 Now it is possible that my friend's father stumbled across that book in the last month

149
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,960
 of his life, read it, and decided to hand write out that prayer, but I don't think that's

150
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
 what happened.

151
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,920
 In fact, the reason why I don't think that happened is because of the translation in

152
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,800
 which he writes out this prayer in his own hand.

153
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,840
 It's not the translation that Bruce uses in the book.

154
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,880
 In fact, I think it's much more likely that my friend's father recalled this prayer from

155
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,720
 an early time in his life.

156
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,040
 He was Dutch and had been raised within the Dutch community before moving to Hong Kong

157
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,500
 later in his life, so it's possible that he might have heard this in the school or something

158
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:50,240
 like that, and in his last dying few weeks, recalls the prayer and decides to write it

159
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,160
 out in hand.

160
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,320
 And as my friend gave me the note, she said, "I would love it if you could speak on this

161
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,000
 passage at the memorial," and that led me into a time of researching a bit about it,

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,760
 looking at the scriptures, understanding the passage, and as I did so, not only did I become

163
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:16,400
 more profoundly fascinated and honoring of her father, I also realized that God had something

164
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,800
 deep to say to me.

165
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,000
 And as I open this up for you here today, I wonder, and I hope and pray, that I'll have

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,920
 something deep to say to you too.

167
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,440
 Prayer of Jabez is just two verses in the Bible.

168
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,600
 He's only mentioned in those two verses.

169
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,880
 It's found in the middle of eight chapters of genealogy at the beginning of 1 Chronicles.

170
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,600
 I don't know if you've read 1 Chronicles much lately.

171
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,560
 It's the story, basically, of Israel and their journey up into the Davidic kingdom, and it

172
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,040
 traces in the first eight chapters this genealogy of all the kings and all the tribes, starting

173
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,160
 with Adam going to Abraham, and then the twelve tribes, and it unpacks all the descendants,

174
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,440
 the generations, flowing out of the kings of those twelve.

175
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,880
 Now here in chapter four, where these two verses are found, it's actually found in the

176
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
 tribe of Judah.

177
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,640
 So Jabez is part of the family of the kings from the tribe of Judah, which tells us something

178
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,800
 straight away, that Jabez was from a privileged background.

179
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,960
 He was a son of one of the kings in the generation in the line of Judah.

180
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,560
 He was probably raised in a place of relative prosperity and wealth.

181
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,000
 And I want to read you the two verses that we have that captures his story.

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,560
 This is 1 Chronicles 4, starting in verse 9.

183
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,640
 "Jabez was more honorable than his brothers.

184
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,120
 His mother had named him Jabez, saying, 'I gave birth to him in pain.'

185
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,800
 Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, 'Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory.

186
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,080
 Let your hand be with me and keep me from harm, so that I will be free from pain.'

187
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,440
 And God granted his request."

188
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,080
 Just two verses in the middle of a genealogy.

189
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,680
 If you're anything like me, when you come across the genealogies in the Bible, you're

190
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
 like...

191
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,800
 But right in the middle of that, we see this fascinating story.

192
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,360
 And the first thing we learn is what his mother has gone through and what she does in response.

193
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,680
 Here's the fascinating thing.

194
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,420
 We all respond in challenging ways when we've experienced trauma.

195
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:26,280
 She names her son Jabez, it says here, "For I gave birth to him in pain."

196
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:33,120
 The name Jabez, literally in the Hebrew, sounds like the Hebrew word for pain.

197
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,200
 His mother, and we don't know the details because we're not given any more details than

198
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,160
 this, but we can assume that her mother had a really bad labor with Jabez.

199
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,600
 So bad that the pain and the time and everything that happened, maybe she even almost died,

200
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
 we don't know.

201
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,720
 But there was so much pain that when Jabez was born, and it was her responsibility to

202
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:00,040
 speak a name, to place a name on him, all she could think of out of her trauma was,

203
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,500
 "This one caused pain."

204
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 That's what his name means.

205
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,340
 "This one caused pain."

206
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:16,280
 And so for the rest of Jabez's life, he's named, he's called the one that causes pain.

207
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,280
 Which shouldn't have happened because when you're a part of a royal family, when you're

208
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,560
 a part of the lineage of the kings, your name that you're given at birth is very important,

209
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,080
 particularly in Hebrew culture.

210
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,220
 And so probably he should have been named for one of his forefathers.

211
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,780
 Or perhaps he could be named for a village or an area where a great battle or victory

212
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,660
 happened in the generations of his family.

213
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,360
 Or maybe at the very least, he should have been given a name that would actually help

214
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,740
 to project this idea of a character or something that God wants to do in his life or something

215
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,380
 that his parents are longing for.

216
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:55,540
 Instead, out of this woman's deep pain of childbirth, she places her hand on her son

217
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,100
 and she says, "This one caused pain."

218
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:04,260
 And Jabez for the rest of his life is causer of pain.

219
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:14,600
 The names and the words and the labels placed over us in life hurt us, don't they?

220
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,760
 We don't know the details here, but we can assume that Jabez grew up in a place of embarrassment

221
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,300
 and shame because of this name.

222
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:28,400
 Surrounded by brothers who probably had much more regal and better names, he's constantly,

223
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,120
 anytime he's called, anytime somebody says his name, anytime he has to introduce himself,

224
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,200
 "Hi, I'm causer of pain."

225
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,860
 It's fascinating to me because in the Hebrew understanding of naming something, in the

226
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,500
 Hebrew worldview of the Old Testament, they thought that names had materialism to them.

227
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,580
 In other words, when you put a name on someone, it was like you were actually literally physically

228
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,360
 placing a mantle on them.

229
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,320
 The word "dabah," which is the Hebrew word for "word," when you speak a word, the word

230
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,100
 suggests a putting on of, almost like you're putting a cloak on somebody.

231
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,040
 A little bit like how Ezekiel would get a cloak put on him as a prophet.

232
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,080
 When we speak a name in the Old Testament Hebrew understanding, it's a physicality to

233
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,320
 it, a weight to it.

234
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,960
 This is why in the modern days, you remember if somebody says to you, "Oh man, their words

235
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
 had weight."

236
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,760
 Remember how we say that?

237
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,280
 That's basically the Old Testament Hebrew understanding of this idea of what naming

238
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
 something is.

239
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,200
 So when his mother does this to him, she knows what she's doing.

240
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,480
 And she's placing upon him, in her mind, a material reality.

241
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,660
 Not just saying something with an arbitrary meaning, she's placing a material reality

242
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,340
 on them out of the depth of her trauma, she causes trauma.

243
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,300
 She's not the first person to have done it in history.

244
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,740
 She will not be the last.

245
00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:01,420
 And Jabez now has to walk in the pain of the reality of this name, shaping his identity,

246
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:08,460
 shaping how he introduces himself, and how he now lives out his life.

247
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:16,540
 And you can almost sense that for Jabez, he's rooted now in a story that he does not want,

248
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,180
 but a story he's not sure how he can get out of.

249
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,420
 I wonder if anyone else feels that way here.

250
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,660
 I wonder if anyone else has ever said something over you, spoken a name over you, labeled

251
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:35,060
 you in some way that has caused you to live a story you're struggling to get out of.

252
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:44,700
 When I was 14 years old, my chemistry teacher at school told me that I would never amount

253
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,660
 to anything.

254
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,940
 His actual words were this, "Andrew, you are a failure.

255
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,180
 Keep this up and you'll never amount to anything in life."

256
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:59,460
 I remember that moment vividly, as if it happened literally just yesterday.

257
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,300
 I remember where I was, I remember the smell of the room, I remember what he was wearing,

258
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,420
 I remember what I was wearing.

259
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,620
 And although I didn't like this person particularly very much, and he was right, I was failing

260
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:16,620
 in chemistry, there was something as a 14-year-old that a person in authority said over me, "I

261
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,540
 will never amount to anything."

262
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:25,820
 And although, of course, neither of us were Jewish, there was this impact to me.

263
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:33,000
 That phrase, those words went deep into a 14-year-old that was trying to build his identity.

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,060
 And I think to begin with, it was at the subconscious level.

265
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,020
 This kind of subconscious level that maybe I'm not going to amount to anything, that

266
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,680
 maybe my life's not going to mean much.

267
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,940
 And then when I became a young adult and started to work and move into adult life, it wasn't

268
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,340
 subconscious anymore, it became a conscious reality to me.

269
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,380
 And I have sat under the power of those words for all of my adult life.

270
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,140
 The one thing I have struggled the most with, and I've shared this quite a bit with you

271
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,940
 as a church over the years, is insecurities.

272
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,580
 Insecurities about my self-worth, insecurities about whether I'm achieving anything or doing

273
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,580
 anything.

274
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,140
 I've struggled a lot in my adult life with imposter syndrome, and I can trace it all

275
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,680
 back to that moment where he has spoken over me.

276
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,580
 And I've realized over the years that those words have done two things, and I wonder whether

277
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,660
 this might resonate with some of you who know some words that have been spoken over you.

278
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:34,860
 Those words have crippled me at times, and they have driven me at times.

279
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:41,060
 On the crippled side, those words have sucked confidence out of me, sucked self-belief,

280
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,300
 and I've struggled with self-doubt for so much of my life.

281
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,020
 In fact, I can't even tell you, Chris was here for the first service, my wife, but I

282
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,020
 can't tell you the number of Sundays where no matter how many people showed up, no matter

283
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:58,260
 how buzzing the worship was, no matter how perhaps impactful maybe the word was, I get

284
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,580
 home and I crawl up onto the couch and I feel terrible.

285
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,140
 I feel like nothing really happened.

286
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,140
 Nobody really responded.

287
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,340
 It wasn't that great of a Sunday.

288
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,180
 Oh, why do I even bother doing this?

289
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,540
 It's like I'm pushing water uphill, I'm not achieving it, and I'll spiral because I'm

290
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:20,420
 tired and I'm worn out, and I'm entering into some of those deeper places that I have where

291
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,300
 there's a brokenness within me because somebody said at the age of 14, "You're never going

292
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,740
 to amount to anything," and that has so crippled me that even to this day, I still have days,

293
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:35,000
 it's not every day, okay, but some days where I feel stripped and drained of the confidence

294
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,040
 that I should have as a son of Christ.

295
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,000
 On other days, those words have driven me.

296
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,980
 They've gotten inside of me and they've made me want to push even harder to prove that

297
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,660
 those words are wrong.

298
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:54,020
 And out of the exhaustion of performance and perfectionism, I've tried to create something

299
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,060
 that perhaps wasn't there, and I've tried to work really hard because I'm trying to

300
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,820
 prove first of all to God, then to myself, then to my family, and then to you all that

301
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,180
 actually I have achieved something with my life.

302
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,560
 I'm turning 50 next year, and if you're over the age of 50 right here, you can close your

303
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,120
 ears right now, but that's really old.

304
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,080
 And I feel really old.

305
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,840
 And I kid you not, I'm having like a midlife crisis, part of the reason why I need to get

306
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
 on sabbatical.

307
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,360
 And I'm having a midlife crisis, this is my midlife crisis.

308
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,080
 I'm almost dead and I haven't achieved anything.

309
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,740
 And I kind of say it as a joke, but the reality is deep inside, that is partly how I reflect

310
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,600
 about myself.

311
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:41,560
 I know that I have been weighed down by the materialistic impact of somebody's words.

312
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,680
 And how about for you?

313
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,040
 What has been spoken over you in your life?

314
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,560
 Perhaps for some of you, it was by somebody who loves you deeply and meant well for you.

315
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,120
 Maybe a parent who said something maybe out of place of love, but those words, man, were

316
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,520
 not what you needed to hear.

317
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,480
 And you've carried those words with you and they've shaped and changed you in some way.

318
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,700
 Perhaps like me, it was a teacher, somebody that you looked up to, an authority figure

319
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
 in your life.

320
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,600
 Perhaps it was a pastor, someone like that.

321
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,880
 But somebody has said something and it's changed you and it's hurt you.

322
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,600
 And it's actually over time begun to shape how you think about the world and how you

323
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,380
 think about yourself.

324
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,000
 And now you feel like you're under the weight of those words and it's really hard for you

325
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,600
 to break out of the weight of those words.

326
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:37,240
 What names or words do you struggle to be free from?

327
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,120
 Jabez struggled to be free from the word that had been placed over him.

328
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,360
 But at some point in his life, he decided to draw a line in the sand.

329
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,920
 We don't know when.

330
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,360
 All we get is the naming of him and the impact that had for him.

331
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,640
 And then we get his prayer.

332
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,440
 At some point though, whether it was when he was still young, probably more likely as

333
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,280
 he got a little bit older, he decided to draw the line in the sand and take action against

334
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,960
 the thing that had been placed upon him.

335
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,480
 And for him, that action, not to hate his mom and to blah, blah, blah.

336
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,120
 His action is to go to God and ask for healing.

337
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
 It's beautiful.

338
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,240
 This is why it says at the beginning of the passage, he was more honorable than his brothers.

339
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,280
 Because he has a heart inside of him to not try to fix things himself.

340
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,760
 He's got a heart inside him to realize the only way I can be lifted from the power that

341
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,760
 this name is placed upon me is by bringing it to God and getting healing and restoration

342
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
 from him.

343
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,280
 He's honorable in his humility to bring action to what has been happening.

344
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,360
 And I want you to see what it says right at the start of verse 10.

345
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,520
 It says, "Jabez cried out."

346
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,760
 The Hebrew word here for cried out doesn't mean like just praised.

347
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,680
 It means from a place of anguish.

348
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,080
 He kind of speaks loudly before God from a place of pain, basically, which is really

349
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,840
 ironic because the writer here is trying to help you to see a journey.

350
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,980
 Jabez, the one who is named causer of pain, is in pain himself.

351
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,360
 And his pain is because his mom has caused him pain, which is ironic.

352
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,120
 She said, "You're the causer of pain," but she's the one who ends up causing him pain.

353
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,720
 And in that place of great pain, not health, not great, in a place of pain, he then cries

354
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
 out.

355
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
 I want you to see how he cries out.

356
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:28,520
 He says, first of all, "Bless me, O that you would bless me and enlarge my territory."

357
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,600
 Remember the context.

358
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,240
 The context is he's a son of a king.

359
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,880
 He's grown up in the royal household.

360
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,520
 He's had privilege from the very beginning of his life.

361
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,720
 He's not crying out to ask God to bless him materially.

362
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,760
 He's calling out and asking God to meet him in the pain and the brokenness of the label

363
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,280
 that has been placed upon him.

364
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,960
 And in that, he says, "Would you bless me?"

365
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,520
 In other words, "Would you turn your face to me?

366
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,680
 Would your presence be here for me?"

367
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,040
 This is not a prayer for prosperity.

368
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,520
 It's a prayer for presence.

369
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:06,720
 God, I need you to be with me because I can't do this anymore, and I'm crushed by the weight

370
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,600
 of the word, the name that has been placed upon me.

371
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,480
 This is why he says, "Enlarge my territory."

372
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,300
 He's not asking for his kingdom to grow.

373
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,560
 He's not asking that he would have more influence in the world and fight bigger battles and

374
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,860
 get bigger influence and get that promotion.

375
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,280
 This is not some materialistic desire.

376
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,560
 What he's realizing is because the name has been placed over him that says, "You're a

377
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,920
 causer of pain," it has shrunk his worldview.

378
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,760
 It has shrunk how he sees himself.

379
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,640
 And he doesn't see himself how he should be seeing himself, and he's seeing much smaller

380
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
 than he should.

381
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,520
 And so he comes to God and says, "Turn your countenance, your presence.

382
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
 Bless me."

383
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,680
 Always about God's presence, primarily in the Old Testament.

384
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:54,240
 "Would you bless me with your presence so that I can have a bigger view of life, a bigger

385
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,760
 view of myself?

386
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,480
 Enlarge the territory.

387
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,560
 Enlarge my way of thinking, my spirit, because I have been crushed."

388
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,640
 And that's what trauma will always do.

389
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,920
 Trauma and names spoken over you will always strip away a big vision and always try to

390
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,880
 reduce you.

391
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,200
 Like for me, I'm never going to amount to anything, so why even bother to try?

392
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:26,520
 Javis says, "Enlarge my territory because I realize that I have shrunk my identity down

393
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,640
 to the power of the word that was put over me."

394
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,760
 Which is why he then says, "May your hand be upon me."

395
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,800
 In Hebrews, in the present continuous tense, which basically means every single day, now

396
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,320
 and forevermore, I need your hand to be with me.

397
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,560
 He's asking for the soles of the feet, not just the king, which is to bless me, enlarge

398
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
 my territory.

399
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,680
 He's saying, "I need you to put your hand upon me every day.

400
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,240
 I want you to be alongside of me, walking with me.

401
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,360
 The soles of your feet, if you will," is how Ezekiel would say it.

402
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,040
 "The soles of your feet be with me.

403
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,720
 I need your hand.

404
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,400
 The hand that is powerful, that can fight battles, that can break chains," because

405
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,080
 Javis realizes there's chains on his heart and he's hurting.

406
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,240
 He's saying, "God, would you break the chain?

407
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:17,000
 Would your hand every single day help me in my journey?"

408
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,520
 And then he gets to the crux of his prayer and he prays this.

409
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:27,800
 He says, "And keep me from harm so that I may be free from pain."

410
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,400
 This little bit right here, "that I may be free from pain," is what's called by scholars

411
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,040
 a textual variance in the Hebrew.

412
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,000
 What that means is that there are various different documents where we derive 1 Chronicles

413
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,700
 from that have words here that are slightly different.

414
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,840
 And there are two ways of interpreting, looking at the textual variances, what he's saying

415
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
 here.

416
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,040
 One is the way it's shown in the NIV, that I would be free from pain, which seems a very

417
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,320
 important thing because he's just told us he's cried out in pain.

418
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,680
 So it makes sense at the end of his prayer he would say, "I want to be free from pain."

419
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,800
 And I think that's a good prayer.

420
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,880
 But as I've studied this text and as I've looked at the documents by which this is drawing

421
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,120
 from, I think the way this is captured in other translations is actually closer to what

422
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,040
 was originally intended in the Hebrew.

423
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,400
 You can see this, for example, in the New King James Version.

424
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,160
 Let me put both side by side.

425
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,840
 So NIV on the left, "so that I will be free from pain."

426
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,680
 And NKJV interprets this way, "that I may not cause pain."

427
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,440
 And I want you to absorb in your spirit here what Jabez is doing.

428
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,400
 I think this is much more textually accurate to what I think Jabez actually prayed.

429
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,180
 And as it comes out in the Hebrew, he's not saying that I would be free from pain.

430
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,640
 He was saying, "so that I don't cause pain anymore."

431
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,840
 What he's saying is, "I don't want to be the name anymore.

432
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,280
 If my name is causer of pain, here is my prayer, that I would not live up to the label that's

433
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,240
 been placed on me.

434
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,160
 That I need your freedom to bring me out from the label that has been put on me.

435
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,800
 I will not be my name.

436
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,200
 And I need you every single day to bless me, bring your presence towards me.

437
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,680
 I need you to enlarge how I see myself because I'm not seeing myself properly right now.

438
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,920
 And I need you so that I would not cause pain.

439
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,320
 So I'm not going to take the name that has been put on me and allow that to shape who

440
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
 I am.

441
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,160
 No, Lord, I'm going to speak in the opposite spirit in this prayer.

442
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,040
 And I'm going to ask you, Lord, release me, release me, release me.

443
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,360
 That I would no longer, my narrative and my story would not be to cause pain.

444
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:35,600
 My name may stay, remained Jabez, but my narrative will not be linked to my name.

445
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:43,320
 That I may be free from pain, yes, but that I may not cause the pain of others.

446
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:51,120
 I will not be the label my mother put on me.

447
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,520
 Let me paraphrase how I think he's expressing the prayer.

448
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,840
 My mother named me as one who causes pain and I have carried this label around with

449
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,720
 me my whole life, but no more.

450
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
 God come and bless me.

451
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,920
 Help me to enlarge the territory of my identity so I do not live out the very name that was

452
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
 placed upon me.

453
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,760
 I don't want to be what my name suggests.

454
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,600
 No, Lord, bless me, change me so that I would not cause pain.

455
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,860
 This is not a prayer for prosperity.

456
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,220
 This is a prayer for inner healing.

457
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,800
 This is a prayer for freedom from the name that was placed upon him.

458
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,680
 That's the prayer of Jabez, my friends.

459
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:37,360
 What fascinates me is that my friend's father, who wrote out this prayer in hand, wrote out

460
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,560
 what I would consider is the right translation of it.

461
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:46,560
 Let me show you once again what he wrote at the end, that I may not cause pain.

462
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,440
 It's interesting.

463
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,200
 I was talking to my friend about him and his journey in life and she told me great stories

464
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,280
 because I was going to have to represent him at the memorial.

465
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
 She told me lots of great stories.

466
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,760
 This man had lived an amazing life.

467
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,880
 He was a person who was a large in the life character that really grabbed life by its

468
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,880
 neck and lived out that idea of better to burn out than fade away.

469
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,360
 He was just full on in his life.

470
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
 He was an entrepreneur.

471
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,160
 He actually lived in Hong Kong the majority of his life and he had changed and done a

472
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,040
 lot of great things for Hong Kong as a city.

473
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,520
 But she also shared stories of some of his challenges and some of the things that he

474
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,480
 hadn't done well, like all of us here who don't always live the perfect life.

475
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,760
 He had had brokenness in his marriage.

476
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,200
 He had found himself in divorce.

477
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,560
 He had brokenness in his finances and what happened in his finances is that actually

478
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,200
 ended up causing quite a lot of pain, pain to himself and pain to his family.

479
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,760
 And I think it's so profound that just a few weeks before he passed, he would write out

480
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,280
 in hand this old prayer that he remembered from when he was a kid and right at the end

481
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,080
 of it he would say, "So that I may not cause pain."

482
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,320
 I don't know whether he gave his life to Jesus at the end of his life or not.

483
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,600
 I have no idea of knowing that, but what I do know is that somehow he found comfort in

484
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,080
 an old prayer and he could use it to express something to his daughter who found the note,

485
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,840
 "I never wanted to cause you pain and I'm sorry for anything that I've done that may

486
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,320
 have caused you pain, that I may not cause pain."

487
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,160
 As I step on the sabbatical tonight, I do so because I'm in need of my version of the

488
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,480
 prayer of Jabez.

489
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,440
 I realize that as a 14-year-old I was spoken over in a way that has impacted my life and

490
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,120
 my insecurities and how I see myself.

491
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,200
 And it's not the first time that I've recognized this.

492
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,280
 I've had years of therapy and prayer and it's helped hugely.

493
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,940
 I've had so many victories and I know standing before you today I'm way stronger than I ever

494
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,480
 used to be, but I realize I desire more.

495
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,080
 I realize that there's more freedom I want.

496
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,960
 I realize that I do not want to carry around any more, even just a little bit of what that

497
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,240
 man said to me when I was 14 years old.

498
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:09,640
 So part of my need for sabbatical is to get away and pray a prayer that ends with that

499
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:17,120
 I would do what it is that you called me to do and never second guess it.

500
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
 That's going to be a journey.

501
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,700
 It's not going to be an easy thing to do and that's what my sabbatical is about.

502
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,560
 How about for you?

503
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,560
 In this year of intimacy here at The Vine, what an opportunity we have to a journey of

504
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
 inner healing.

505
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:35,280
 And there have been some words and some names that either have been spoken over you, that

506
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,200
 you know you struggle to be free from, or that, and we felt this at the end of the first

507
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:47,960
 service, or that you've spoken over yourself, ways that you've come to define yourself or

508
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,720
 maybe out of your own traumas or your own past experiences, and you've labeled yourself

509
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,360
 a certain way that actually Christ looks over you and says, "That's not who I created you

510
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,160
 to be," or, "That's not who you are.

511
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,680
 There's so much more in you.

512
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,920
 You're not a failure as you are currently defining yourself.

513
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,400
 You're not one who can't be loved as you're currently saying about yourself.

514
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,120
 You're not one who has been rejected or lonely as you think right now about yourself.

515
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,600
 The names we place over ourselves have such also depth to hold us captive."

516
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,600
 So whether somebody has said something to you or you know you've said something to yourself,

517
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,960
 either way you know that there's change, you know that there's hurt, you know that there's

518
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,240
 a need for freedom and healing.

519
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,920
 That's what my sabbatical is going to be about, but I also pray that that's what this is about

520
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
 for you too.

521
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,520
 I want to encourage you to just open your heart.

522
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:48,480
 And I thought for some of you here, words spoken over you, and you're like Jabez, you're

523
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,640
 like, "Enough is enough.

524
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,280
 They've crippled me and they've driven me.

525
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
 I'm going to come.

526
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,680
 Lord, would you bless me?

527
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,040
 Would you enlarge the places that I have made small?

528
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,920
 Would you be with me every day because I need you every day in this?

529
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,360
 And would you enable me to walk in the opposite spirit of the name that has been spoken of

530
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,360
 me?

531
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
 I will not accept it anymore."

532
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:17,120
 And I pray as you do that, you will see freedom in your life like never before.

533
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
 Here's what I want you to do.

534
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,040
 Maybe we could just close our eyes and bow our heads.

535
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
 Here's what I want to do.

536
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,600
 I want to lead you in a ministry moment here.

537
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:33,240
 If this has been speaking to you and if this resonates with you, in a moment I'm going

538
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,720
 to invite you just to respond by opening your hands.

539
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,280
 And opening your hands is just a subtle way of coming before the Lord here this morning

540
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,520
 and saying, "I need this too.

541
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,760
 I need my version of the prayer of Jabez.

542
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,360
 I need inner healing from some of the things that have been spoken over me and I'm tired.

543
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,320
 I don't want to carry it around with me anymore.

544
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,480
 Or I need freedom from the things that I've been saying about myself.

545
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,440
 One of the things that I know in my life, I've been saying I'm old a lot lately.

546
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,440
 And honestly, I felt convicted by the Holy Spirit this morning because in the view of

547
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,360
 eternity I'm really, really, really, really, really, really young in the name of Jesus.

548
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,000
 I need to stop cursing myself by saying I'm old.

549
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,880
 And I cut that off right now in the name of Jesus.

550
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,440
 Forgive me, Lord.

551
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,040
 So Lord, any words that people in this room have spoken over themselves that are not of

552
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,040
 you, Lord, we want to bring those to you too.

553
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,600
 So this is for you, maybe just you can open your hands as you're sat and I want to pray.

554
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,080
 Father, we are very grateful that we have your presence with us.

555
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:53,040
 We're very grateful that, yeah, through the story of a man who would claim to be an atheist,

556
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,120
 we have an entry point into understanding a prayer that perhaps has been misunderstood

557
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,840
 for too long.

558
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,280
 And Father, I know that there is a lot that the enemy has done over us and over individuals

559
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,080
 here in this room over years.

560
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,840
 Lord, I know that there are people in this room who have carried and are carrying the

561
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,560
 wrong identity or the wrong thought about themselves simply because somebody has labeled

562
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
 them.

563
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,360
 And you need to know here this morning, you are not your label.

564
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,200
 I'm going to say that again in the name of Jesus.

565
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,440
 You are not your label.

566
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,840
 You are not that name.

567
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,240
 You are not that word.

568
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,180
 You are not the label that has been placed upon you.

569
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,700
 You are exactly who God says you are.

570
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,880
 And you are alive in Christ.

571
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,840
 And Christ looks at you as a child of His.

572
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,000
 And He says, "You are just as I have created you to be.

573
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,560
 And that there is nothing, nothing that I cannot liberate you from."

574
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,640
 So Lord, we come to you with our hands open and with the recognition of perhaps for some

575
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,320
 of us years of hurt and pain.

576
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,360
 Lord, we want to pray first of all for your presence.

577
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,360
 Come Holy Spirit, come.

578
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,480
 I want to pray that that starting of the Jabez prayer would be for each person here.

579
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
 Come and bless me.

580
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,520
 Turn your face towards me.

581
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,880
 Maybe that can just be if your hands are open.

582
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,800
 That can be the starting point of this prayer right now.

583
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,840
 Just come before the Holy Spirit and say, "Lord, would you turn your face to me?

584
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
 Would your presence be here?"

585
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,240
 It's not like you have to convince Him to do that.

586
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,720
 Of course, He's present with you.

587
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,200
 But just in asking Him to bless you, it's an opening of your heart.

588
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,480
 That's the starting point of walking in the opposite spirit.

589
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,040
 "Lord, I ask that you would bless me.

590
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,800
 I believe that I'm a person who deserves your blessing."

591
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,480
 For some of you, that's a breakthrough right then.

592
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,080
 I just sense that as I'm praying.

593
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,600
 This is a breakthrough right now in the spirit.

594
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,400
 Just you saying, "Lord, bless me," is a massive breakthrough for you because you didn't think

595
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,480
 you were worthy of His blessings.

596
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,200
 Holy Spirit, come.

597
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,800
 I want to encourage you for you now.

598
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,960
 As you've asked God to turn His countenance and His presence towards you, here's your

599
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
 next prayer.

600
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,800
 "Lord, enlarge my territory."

601
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,240
 Maybe just bring what it is that you know you're carrying, the smallness perhaps, the

602
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,600
 shrinking of your identity.

603
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,400
 Yeah, whatever it is that has caused you to think less of yourself.

604
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,920
 Not to have big dreams, but small dreams because you don't think you deserve it or you don't

605
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,200
 think you're good enough.

606
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,880
 And you've reduced the sphere of your influence.

607
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,020
 I want to pray that you would have the faith and the courage to say, "Lord, would you enlarge

608
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,020
 my territory?

609
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,560
 Enlarge my spirit?

610
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,120
 Enlarge my emotions?

611
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:48,880
 Enlarge the way that I think about myself?"

612
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,720
 Then I want you to pray, "Lord, would you be with me every day?

613
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,280
 Father, not just in this moment where it feels good and safe and right, but Lord, tomorrow

614
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,160
 morning when I wake up and the kids are crying and I've got to rush to work and it's going

615
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,440
 to be crazy and I would have forgotten everything that happened on Sunday.

616
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,760
 And Lord, in that moment, would you be with me even more powerfully than you're with me

617
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
 in this moment?

618
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,280
 Lord, I need you every day.

619
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,200
 I need you to be my strong right arm, my strong and mighty tower.

620
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,600
 Your name, not mine, your name would be my rear guard, my yesterday, today and forever."

621
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:32,000
 And in that courage that you've already had, here's the final part of the prayer.

622
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,840
 For Jabez, it was, "Man, somebody put a name over me that I'm one who causes pain, so here's

623
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
 my prayer.

624
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,200
 Lord, help me not to cause pain."

625
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,840
 For you, if somebody has said to you, "You're not good enough," here's your prayer today,

626
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,640
 "Lord, help me to know that I am good enough."

627
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,920
 Or perhaps even stronger than that, you say, "Lord, I declare that I am good enough."

628
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,040
 If someone's told you, "You're not lovable," here's your reply, "Lord, I am lovable.

629
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,840
 I am the apple of your eye.

630
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,600
 And I believe I'm worthy of being loved."

631
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,800
 So whatever is the opposite of whatever that name is that's been placed over you, that's

632
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,240
 your prayer of Jabez, and that's your opportunity to come now, just in the quietness of your

633
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,360
 heart, go, "Lord, this for me.

634
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,520
 I will not accept what it is that's being said.

635
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,720
 And I move now in the opposite spirit, and I release, Lord.

636
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,240
 And I say the opposite of what has been labeled me.

637
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,600
 I am not my label.

638
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,080
 I am this as a child of God.

639
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,860
 I am this as a child of Christ.

640
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,480
 And Christ has paid the price on the cross for all of the brokenness that I seem to be

641
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
 carrying with me.

642
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,480
 And Lord, would you bring liberation, liberation, Holy Spirit."

643
00:40:43,480 --> 00:41:04,480
 I was going to invite in a second the worship team just to just lead us, but I want to ask

644
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,560
 you just to stay in a place of receiving.

645
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,560
 This is for you today.

646
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
 We're going to have the prayer team.

647
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,800
 In fact, maybe I could just invite the prayer team just to be at the front already, our

648
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
 altar call prayer team.

649
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,600
 And I want to encourage you, this is really important for you today.

650
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,400
 Don't leave here today without getting prayer.

651
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,920
 As much as it's been good for us to go through this as a community, but there's some individual

652
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,480
 things that we would love to pray for you about.

653
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,040
 And there's some of you here where, you know, just having someone come around you, lay their

654
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,280
 hands on you, speak truth into you, both in the upper house and the lower house.

655
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,840
 If you're outside, you can come in in a moment.

656
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,320
 We would love to stand with you and pray for you so the prayer team can be available.

657
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,880
 And in a moment, if you would like prayer, just come forward anytime.

658
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,120
 You don't have to wait until the end of the service.

659
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,120
 Just come forward.

660
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,800
 Even right now, if you want to receive prayer, just start to come forward.

661
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,200
 Someone's going to put their hands on you.

662
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
 They're going to pray for you.

663
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,520
 We're going to worship together.

664
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,000
 And we're going to believe that Christ is going to continue to set chains free, to restore

665
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,160
 people's identities, to break off the names and the words and the labels that have been

666
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
 placed on us.

667
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,800
 And we're going to do this in an atmosphere of joy and wonder for a God who loves us so

668
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800
 much.

669
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
 And we thank you for that.

670
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
 In Jesus' name.

671
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
 Would you stand with me?

672
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,400
 And like I say, if you want prayer, don't be shy.

673
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
 Come on, church.

674
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,040
 We did this a few weeks ago and people came forward for prayer.

675
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,280
 We'd love to invite you to do that.

676
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,000
 Otherwise you can continue just to receive what he has for you as we enter in this time

677
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 of worship.
