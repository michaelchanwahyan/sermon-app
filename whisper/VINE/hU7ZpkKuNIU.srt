1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 Father, what a joy it is to gather together and declare some biblical truths about who

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,840
 you are.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,740
 That you make a way where there doesn't seem to be a way.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,540
 Where you are one who can step into the impossible and make it possible.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,860
 Where when you say something, your word does not return to you void, but it achieves every

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,100
 purpose and promise for you.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,260
 You're a promise keeper, Lord.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:29,020
 And Father, as we gather together here at the start of Advent, a season that celebrates

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,460
 your arrival on Christmas Day, but also anticipates your coming again at the end of all things.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,900
 Father, our hearts are turned towards you.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,660
 And you are who you say that you are, Lord.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,620
 And we know that so often we struggle.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,100
 We know so often our lives change and things happen that we didn't anticipate or expect.

14
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,060
 Lord, we know that life is not always easy.

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,900
 And Lord, although things change and shift so much for us, you remain who you are.

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,660
 You are the same yesterday, today, and forever.

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,780
 You are the anchor by which we can put our trust and our faith in you.

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,020
 So Father, I want to pray for every person in this room who's watching online right now,

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,660
 anybody who's in the overflow.

20
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,500
 Father, I want to pray by the power of God, Lord, that you would step into their situation

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,500
 in this moment.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:29,740
 Lord, you don't always guarantee us an immediate change in our circumstances, but you do guarantee

23
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,820
 us your presence in the midst of what it is that we go through.

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,580
 And so Lord, I want to pray for each person here who maybe is in a moment or season where

25
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,300
 they need you to reveal yourself again.

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,540
 That way maker, that promise keeper, that miracle worker, the one who is the light in

27
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,580
 the darkness for them.

28
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:57,460
 And Father, I want to pray that you, who you are, would be made manifest to every single

29
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,460
 person.

30
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,700
 And Father, our ability to worship flows out of seeing who you are.

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,760
 Your word says that we are able to love because you first loved us.

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:13,340
 It is that encounter of you, the unchanging, immutable, powerful Lord, that we then extend

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,860
 love, extend grace, extend hope, extend freedom.

34
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,460
 Lord, it flows from who you are.

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,300
 So Lord, I pray that you would reveal to us, even over the next four weeks, as we celebrate

36
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,980
 Advent and we look at the coming of Christ, you would reveal to us more and more about

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,260
 who you are, why you came, how you met us, the way the world has changed and shifted

38
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,940
 since you were born in that stable in Bethlehem some 2000 years ago.

39
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,340
 Father, that's the story we celebrate.

40
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,460
 No matter whether we've heard that story a thousand times before or whether that's a

41
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,380
 fresh new idea for us, Lord, I pray that your word would move in power over this church

42
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,100
 over the next four weeks.

43
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,580
 And Father, we celebrate that.

44
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,580
 We thank you for it.

45
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,180
 And we pray all of this in Jesus' name.

46
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,340
 Everyone says, "Hey, can we thank our youth here?

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,020
 Look at this!

48
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,020
 Our youth!

49
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,820
 Oh my goodness, how cool.

50
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,740
 Next Gen Band, we call them.

51
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,740
 We've been working with them.

52
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,860
 Roberto Ginetto, I want to honor him.

53
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,500
 Roberto has been working with them on Saturday mornings to get their hearts and their skills

54
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
 prepared.

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,580
 And Emma and the team have been working with them over the last number of weeks as well.

56
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:34,580
 Can we give another round of applause to our youth and all that they've done?

57
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,580
 So great.

58
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,580
 Welcome to the Vine.

59
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,820
 If you're relatively new to the Vine, my name's Andrew.

60
00:03:37,820 --> 00:04:00,020
 I'm one of the pastors here, and it's just so great to be with you.

61
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,740
 Things don't always work out how we plan them in life, do they?

62
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,180
 I think if we're honest with ourselves, actually, so much of our lives is a little bit of a

63
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,500
 mess.

64
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,500
 And no matter how perfect we might try to make stuff appear, the reality is we can often

65
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,540
 struggle, can't we, with keeping things perfect in our lives.

66
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,460
 That's so often if we're honest with ourselves, we would have to admit that we're pretty messy.

67
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,760
 And at times we can be pretty messed up.

68
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,540
 And I think us humans have become really good at actually projecting a version of ourselves

69
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,620
 into the world that looks perfect to everybody around us to kind of mask or hide the reality

70
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,240
 that there's still some messiness and some messed upness in us.

71
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,740
 Or maybe I'm the only one who does that.

72
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
 Anyone else here maybe do that?

73
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,740
 You don't have to put your hand up.

74
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,100
 Okay, put your hand up if you do that.

75
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,020
 Yes, I want to see those hands boldly proclaiming that we can do this, can't we, in life, that

76
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,380
 we know that there's some stuff in us that we're not proud of, that we don't love.

77
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,420
 And so we project into the world something because what we ultimately want to do is kind

78
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:14,700
 of distract people from seeing the true person that we are.

79
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,820
 Magicians call this misdirection.

80
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,260
 In fact, if I am...

81
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,380
 Let me just show you this.

82
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,780
 If I was, for example, going to make this coin disappear, what I would do is I would

83
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,340
 show you this coin and I would tell you that this is a Hong Kong $5 coin, that it's a real

84
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,220
 coin, and then I would put it on my thing like this and I would do this, pretending

85
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,260
 that I'm going to make it disappear, but then I'd accidentally drop it on the table and

86
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,940
 then I would put it back in my hand and I would start doing this again and then suddenly

87
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,780
 it would disappear.

88
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,660
 Wow.

89
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
 You're welcome.

90
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,580
 I'm here all week.

91
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:56,940
 What you may not realize though is that the coin is actually up here.

92
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,940
 There.

93
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,140
 Misdirection.

94
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:08,340
 Distracting people over here so they don't realize what's truly going on over here.

95
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,380
 Are you with me?

96
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,820
 Here's why I share all that with you.

97
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,860
 I think in the world's modern day celebration of Christmas, we have one of the most subversive

98
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,620
 misdirections that there has ever been created.

99
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,740
 I don't know if you've realized this, but the world has secularized Christmas over the

100
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,940
 last number of years.

101
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,900
 What we have in the world is, "Hey, look at this thing over here that we now define and

102
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,420
 call Christmas," and it has nothing actually to do often with the reality of the true,

103
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,420
 original Christmas.

104
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,460
 Are you with me?

105
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,160
 It's kind of like this sort of thing of like, "Hey, let's even try and get all of Jesus

106
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,980
 out of Christmas."

107
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,020
 Have you seen X-mas written around the place?

108
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,060
 Let's just get rid of Christ from Christmas because that story is just a little bit uncomfortable,

109
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,220
 and not everybody believes in Jesus, so we can't talk about Jesus at Christmas even though

110
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,380
 the holiday is actually about Jesus.

111
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:10,140
 We'll call it seasons greetings, happy holidays, and we'll try to make it look as benign and

112
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,540
 as nice and really all of this about family and celebration, and we'll try to project

113
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,620
 this image of what Christmas should be to distract the world from the reality of what

114
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,500
 Christmas truly is, about somebody who was born into this life to give people great hope,

115
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,740
 who on the cross died, gave up his life so that we may have grace and forgiveness, and

116
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,220
 we could know the fullness of life.

117
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,820
 But we don't want anyone to know that story, so happy holidays to you all.

118
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,340
 Are you with me?

119
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,500
 Now even when Jesus is included in the Christmas story, in the modern day celebration of it,

120
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,700
 it's normally a saccharine version of Jesus.

121
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,420
 It's normally the perfect Jesus that you have ever seen, or maybe the hallmark card that

122
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,140
 you buy for someone to give to them on Christmas day presents the nativity scene in the most

123
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,060
 perfect and beautiful way you've ever noticed.

124
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,620
 Let me give you an example of it.

125
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,620
 I found this one online this week.

126
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,020
 Ah, isn't that just the perfect nativity scene?

127
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,340
 You've got the beautiful star in the background.

128
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,000
 It looks like a wonderful oasis that you might want to go to holiday for.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
 Look at that sheep, the perfect sheep ever.

130
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,800
 The sheep just staring gazily into Jesus' eyes.

131
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,640
 There's Jesus lying down in a halo of sunbeams, even though he's just been born.

132
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,400
 Are you with me, people?

133
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,120
 So we turn the Christmas story into this kind of perception that we're comfortable with,

134
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,440
 that we think makes us feel good, when the reality is that's as far away from the reality

135
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,680
 of that first Christmas as possible.

136
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,440
 And then we do this in movies, and we do this in stuff like whatever Christmas movie you're

137
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,360
 going to watch over the Christmas period, other than Die Hard, it presents a version

138
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,240
 of the Christmas family a lot like this one, right?

139
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,840
 Like the perfect Christmas family.

140
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
 There they are.

141
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,320
 They can't get whiter than that.

142
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,080
 They're surrounding by the tree behind them.

143
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,560
 There's beautiful lights everywhere.

144
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,180
 I mean, it is a beautiful scene.

145
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,920
 This is Christmas.

146
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,360
 And that makes us all, here's the ironic thing, that makes us all want to have the perfect

147
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,200
 Christmas ourselves, don't we?

148
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,060
 Like we want Christmas to be perfect.

149
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,920
 We want it to look just like that.

150
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,240
 And so we decorate our homes, and we call our friends over, and we cook the food, and

151
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,320
 we make it perfect, and we want it to arrive on time.

152
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,000
 And if it doesn't, we get really angry and upset, and it's super stressful to make everything

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,220
 super perfect.

154
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,660
 But we think we need a perfect Christmas because the world is telling us that Christmas has

155
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,180
 to be perfect.

156
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:39,880
 The funny thing is we even as Christians spiritualize the perfectness of Christmas.

157
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,960
 Oh, if I could just pull off the perfect Christmas for my family this year, Jesus, we'd be glorified.

158
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,400
 Like if the food is perfect, the turkey's nice and moist, if all the presents are brought

159
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,080
 and put under the tree at the right time, if my kids are happy with what I brought them,

160
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,880
 Jesus will be glorified in our midst.

161
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,540
 I wonder in our desire to try to create the perfect Christmas that we're actually in danger

162
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,900
 of missing out on what Christmas truly is.

163
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,140
 Or to put it another way, is our striving for the perfect Christmas simply Christmas

164
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,640
 misdirection?

165
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,580
 Think about it for a moment.

166
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:29,160
 Because the first Christmas was an absolute mess.

167
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,860
 Nothing went right with that first Christmas.

168
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,420
 I mean, if you want a perfect Christmas, do not open the pages of the Gospels.

169
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,200
 I mean, just stop for a moment and think about what you see in that first Christmas.

170
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,300
 Number one, a crisis teenage pregnancy, awkward.

171
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,620
 Number two, an unexplained and unexpected road trip at the last minute.

172
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,980
 An arrival and the accommodation is messed up.

173
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,640
 A not very ideal birthing environment for a child.

174
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,900
 And then to top it off, three weird old astrolobers from the East come over and visit you.

175
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:11,060
 And then just to add more to that, there's a genocide that happens in the very place

176
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,980
 where the child is born.

177
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,140
 That's a messed up Christmas.

178
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,060
 That should make you feel better about some of your messed up Christmases over the years.

179
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,500
 But that's the reality of the first Christmas.

180
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,660
 It's so messed up and so chaotic and the people involved in it are so confused about what's

181
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,140
 happening that they have no idea that they're getting swept up in this redemptive moment

182
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,140
 of history.

183
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:38,700
 The first Christmas is so messed up and it's just as God wanted it.

184
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,340
 It was quite literally Christmas.

185
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,340
 See what I did there?

186
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

187
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,400
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.

188
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:56,060
 This Advent, we want to take you into the messiness of Christmas.

189
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,940
 Because it's actually in the messiness where the message of Christmas sits.

190
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,100
 And if you try to do some misdirection, try to ignore the reality that the first Christmas

191
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,980
 was a little bit messy, you actually kind of miss what the hope of the first Christmas

192
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,540
 is all about for you and for me.

193
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,180
 I mean, think about the incarnation for a start.

194
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:24,340
 God decides to send his perfect representation of himself, the perfect manifestation of himself

195
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,180
 in the incarnation of Jesus, fully God and fully human, born into that smelly, horrible,

196
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,300
 not like the Christmas card, that smelly, horrible, dark, damp cave that he was born

197
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,860
 into.

198
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,740
 And he was there in the messiness to tell us something.

199
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,900
 That no matter how messy the world is, no matter how broken and chaotic this place can

200
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,380
 be, and you could probably think that the world today is just as messed up and chaotic

201
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:57,220
 and broken as it ever was, that Jesus is happy to be born in that place.

202
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,960
 That he's happy to be born in a place that isn't all right.

203
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,220
 That he's not interested in some misdirection.

204
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,060
 That he actually wants to meet you, yourself, in your personal brokenness, in your messiness.

205
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,460
 The beauty of the incarnation is that Jesus did not come for a perfect world filled with

206
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,460
 perfect people.

207
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,700
 If that was the case, he wouldn't have come at all.

208
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,420
 He's come to an imperfect world filled with imperfect people because in meeting the imperfect

209
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:32,620
 people, he might bring us into the righteousness, not the perfection, the righteousness of Christ.

210
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,940
 So that we might know a saving relationship with him.

211
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,980
 And when he comes again, advent, when he comes again at the end of all things, we are presented

212
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,860
 to him holy and pure, presented to him without blemish as a bride before him because of the

213
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,380
 work he's done inside of us.

214
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,020
 That's why Christmas is messy.

215
00:13:54,020 --> 00:14:00,180
 Because it says something to us about our messiness.

216
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,620
 And so over advent, we're going to unpack the messy moments of Christmas together.

217
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,140
 Next week, we're going to look at that really messy time with Zachariah and the angel in

218
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,900
 the temple and his silence.

219
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,500
 And then the messiness of Mary having her pregnancy and everybody thinking that she

220
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,900
 had sex before marriage.

221
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,940
 The week after that, we're going to look at the family, Mary and Joseph arriving in Bethlehem

222
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,460
 and nobody in their family welcoming them in.

223
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,980
 Not because as the carols sometimes tell us, that the whole place was filled, but because

224
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:36,260
 nobody in their family wanted anything to do with a pregnant, unmarried teenager.

225
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,460
 And then the week after that, we're going to look at Jesus when he's just eight days

226
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,780
 old in the temple and the prophets turn up and speak to him and say some pretty messy

227
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,540
 stuff to Mary and to Jesus.

228
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,500
 Stuff that would come to define the things that would happen in their lives in the years

229
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 ahead.

230
00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:00,980
 And in this, our hope for you and for us is that we would strip the misdirection of Christmas

231
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:08,020
 from us so that we would see Christmas as it was truly meant to be seen.

232
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,900
 It might surprise you, but the gospel writers were intent in stripping the misdirection

233
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,540
 out of the story of the life of Jesus.

234
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,620
 In fact, Matthew and Luke, who are the ones that tell us the birth story of Jesus, they

235
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,740
 do everything in that birth story to try to communicate to you that this was not a perfect

236
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,740
 time.

237
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,900
 That this was not just as everybody else thought it should be, although it was exactly as God

238
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,580
 had planned it to be.

239
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,860
 And I think no more powerfully do they show us this than in what both of them do in presenting

240
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,860
 to us the genealogy of Jesus.

241
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,980
 Genealogy is a fancy word to talk about the bloodline, the family before him that came

242
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,180
 to make who Jesus is and was.

243
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,060
 Now that genealogy is presented to us in both Matthew and in Luke.

244
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,900
 Matthew chapter one, Luke chapter three.

245
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,060
 I'm not going to read you in detail those genealogies today.

246
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,580
 You can do that during the week.

247
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,060
 I encourage you to do that.

248
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,860
 What I want to do today is tell you the stories about the people who are in the genealogies.

249
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,640
 Because I think in understanding their story, you might understand Jesus' story better,

250
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,720
 and therefore you might understand your story better.

251
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,300
 You see some incredible people in the genealogies in Matthew and Luke.

252
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,940
 You see people like Abraham, the father of the faith, the one who began Israel itself,

253
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,900
 the one who was faithful to God and did so many things as an act of love and grace to

254
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,060
 him.

255
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,980
 You see characters like Isaac.

256
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,580
 Isaac, who was incredibly obedient.

257
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,620
 In fact, one of the best examples we have in scripture of somebody who's obedient to

258
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,940
 God's call on their life.

259
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,680
 We see the prophets like there's Hezekiah and Amos in the genealogies.

260
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,100
 Great prophets who held God's word and had the courage and the boldness to speak that

261
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,100
 word into the world.

262
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,280
 And it was a beautiful thing.

263
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,700
 We see great moral leaders in those genealogies.

264
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:03,680
 People like Boaz and Jesse, people like Elam, ones who walked out this idea of what it meant

265
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,080
 to live for God, the kingdom of God in the world today.

266
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,140
 And of course you see kings.

267
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,600
 You see kings in the genealogy.

268
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,340
 David, his son Solomon, Rehoboam, all kings that led Israel at different periods of time.

269
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:21,380
 And when you see the genealogy like that, you can begin to understand why Matthew and

270
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,060
 Luke include such amazing figures in their genealogy.

271
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,760
 See genealogies in the first century were designed to tell you something about the individual.

272
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,040
 If you wanted to say to someone, "Hey, this individual is worth your time," you would

273
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,260
 tell them the family that they've come from.

274
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,460
 We don't do this in Hong Kong society at all, do we?

275
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
 Oh, okay.

276
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
 Sorry.

277
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,460
 Too close.

278
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,460
 All right.

279
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
 So, but you know what I'm saying?

280
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,380
 Like who you've come from, the people who've gone before you say something about who you

281
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,380
 are.

282
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,340
 And so when Matthew and Luke are trying to present Jesus as the Messiah, they're trying

283
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,260
 to fill the genealogy with people that speak of the glory and the goodness of this person.

284
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,100
 Matthew, who's writing predominantly to a Jewish audience, starts from the place of

285
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,340
 Abraham, which makes sense because he's trying to convince Jewish people that Jesus is their

286
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,860
 long-awaited Messiah.

287
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:14,020
 Luke, though, Luke's writing to a Gentile audience, mostly a Gentile audience.

288
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,420
 So he doesn't start with Abraham.

289
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,040
 He goes all the way back to Adam.

290
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
 Why does he go back to Adam?

291
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:24,060
 Because Adam is the father of all people, regardless of background or race or culture.

292
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,260
 And so Luke takes us all the way back there to say this Jesus is for everybody.

293
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,780
 But in their presentations, they're basically saying, "Here's Abraham.

294
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,780
 Here's the kings.

295
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,900
 Here's the miracle workers.

296
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
 Here's the prophets.

297
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,460
 Here's all these people that make Jesus."

298
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,740
 And we do the same, don't we?

299
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,340
 When we tell people stories about our families, we tell them the good stuff, right?

300
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,140
 We tell them, I've already received a number of Christmas cards so far this year.

301
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,540
 I love getting Christmas cards.

302
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,300
 Christmas cards tell you all the great stuff that's happening with families.

303
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,300
 Here's all the things that have happened.

304
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,420
 And we do this, don't we?

305
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,220
 We talk to people like this, like, "Hey, let me tell you about little Bobby and what

306
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,140
 he got in his latest test."

307
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,420
 If little Bobby didn't do good in the latest test, you don't talk about that, right?

308
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,500
 Or whatever it might be, whatever achievement and stuff, we don't talk about the messy stuff,

309
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
 do we?

310
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,100
 We don't present the failures or anything like that.

311
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,460
 We don't tell people, "Oh, let me tell you about Uncle Bob who's in jail."

312
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,380
 Let me tell you about Ted who cheated on his wife.

313
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,380
 He's part of my family.

314
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,500
 Oh, a little awkward, but let's talk about that one.

315
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,060
 You come over to my house and you'll see photos in my house.

316
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,820
 Those photos are from good times that my family has.

317
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,340
 I don't splash the photos of the arguments and the breakdowns and the discussions and

318
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,540
 the things that Chris and I disagree on.

319
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,860
 I don't present that sort of stuff to the world.

320
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,940
 We love to present to the world who we think the world should think us to be.

321
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,580
 And you would think that Matthew and Luke, in presenting Jesus as the Messiah, would

322
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,060
 do exactly the same thing.

323
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,820
 Here's the thing.

324
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,820
 While they do include a few people like I've already mentioned who are amazing people,

325
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,100
 the majority of the genealogy, guess what?

326
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,140
 The people are really messed up.

327
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,700
 That should shock you.

328
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,700
 That's what Matthew and Luke should not have done.

329
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,900
 But they don't shy away from the messy background to Jesus.

330
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,900
 In fact, they want you to see it.

331
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:27,060
 They shine a light on it so that you can begin to wrestle with the incredible reality that

332
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:33,940
 some really screwed up people went into the bloodline that formed and brought Jesus Christ.

333
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,100
 So I want to tell you some of the stories of some of the people that you'll find in

334
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:45,500
 Matthew and Luke's presentation of the genealogy of Jesus.

335
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:53,300
 You'll find characters like this, like Jacob and Jeconiah, who were basically serial liars

336
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,980
 and manipulative deceivers.

337
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:07,400
 There's people like David and Jocham, who were murderers, adulterers, and rapists.

338
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
 You'll find Judah.

339
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,620
 Judah's an interesting one.

340
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,740
 Judah is a human trafficker and sexual abuser.

341
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:20,380
 You'll find Abijah and Manasseh, both who are idol worshippers, by the way.

342
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,860
 Down the list a little bit further in Matthew's, there is Rahab.

343
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,060
 She's a brothel owner and a prostitute.

344
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,860
 Tamar's always a fascinating one for me.

345
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,940
 Tamar slept with her father-in-law, so basically entered into incest.

346
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,420
 You've got Solomon, who was essentially a sex addict.

347
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,820
 He had 300 sex slaves.

348
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:47,980
 You have Ahaziah, and this one might be the most disgusting of all, Ahaziah, who actually

349
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,940
 was involved in child sacrifice.

350
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:59,300
 All of these people, Matthew and Luke don't shy away from, despite the difficulties of

351
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,260
 their stories.

352
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,940
 But it's not just those that have abused that are in the bloodline.

353
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,900
 There's also examples of those that have been abused in the bloodline.

354
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,340
 So in here as well, it's Bathsheba.

355
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,900
 Bathsheba, who was exploited by King David for her body.

356
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,620
 There is Ruth, who was a Moabitess.

357
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,820
 The Jewish people hated the Moabites.

358
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,340
 She's included in the line.

359
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:26,300
 And she was someone who was actually discriminated against time and time again.

360
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,220
 You then got Mary in the list, of course.

361
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,540
 Mary comes towards the end.

362
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,020
 She was someone who was falsely accused.

363
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,060
 People accused her of having sex before marriage when that wasn't the case.

364
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,940
 So you've got those that have also been mistreated in the list.

365
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,660
 Add to that then a whole bunch of names.

366
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,180
 Let me read these to you.

367
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:49,580
 People like Azor, there's Zadok, Achim, Eliud.

368
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,260
 The reason why I read you these names is because we know nothing about them.

369
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,060
 There's no story about them at all.

370
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,180
 They're not mentioned anywhere else in the Bible.

371
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,900
 They're completely forgotten to history.

372
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:05,460
 You could actually argue that these are forgotten, unknown, and insignificant people.

373
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,020
 They're also on the list.

374
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:14,540
 So just take a second and look at Jesus's family tree.

375
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,780
 These are the stories that go to feed into the person of Jesus.

376
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,940
 And Matthew and Luke are like, "Look at this."

377
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,380
 And some of us in this room, we have some pretty broken families that we're from, but

378
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,260
 maybe this is a comfort to you that your family's not quite like this.

379
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,060
 This is pretty full on.

380
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,140
 And Matthew and Luke, what they're doing is they're like, "No more misdirection here.

381
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,700
 We're not going to try and convince you that the Messiah is this perfect God, this perfect

382
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,580
 person for a perfect world.

383
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:52,260
 He's a perfect God and a perfect person for a really broken, screwed up world."

384
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,260
 And guess what?

385
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,820
 All that brokenness, all that screwed upness, it's all come up to form who He is.

386
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,360
 His bloodline is not great.

387
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,860
 His bloodline actually is a reflection of us, of humanity.

388
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,940
 And this, my friends, is what Christmas is all about.

389
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,140
 Matthew and Luke are trying to shine a spotlight right at the start and say, "Here's the purest

390
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,120
 message of Christmas, that Jesus is willing to step into the muck and the brokenness and

391
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,120
 all the stuff that there is in life, all of the stuff that we would rather sweep under

392
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,740
 the carpet, we'd rather do some misdirection so people don't know that about us, all of

393
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,180
 that stuff is why Jesus came.

394
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,880
 This is the gospel at its purest form.

395
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,160
 He didn't come for you when you got yourself cleaned up.

396
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,000
 He didn't come for you when you were all so perfect and nice.

397
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,120
 So many of us think that Jesus would come to us if we just stopped sinning.

398
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,220
 The reality is He came to you whilst you were still a sinner.

399
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:55,640
 He steps into the muckiest of our mucks and says, "I am here.

400
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,600
 I'm here with you."

401
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,960
 That's the beauty of Christmas.

402
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,520
 And any time we try to turn it into something else, we're actually stripping Christmas from

403
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,760
 the gospel for which it was founded in the first place.

404
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:19,800
 See, here's what Jesus' genealogy teaches us, that no one is so bad, so sinful, so mistreated,

405
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:28,680
 so forgotten, so cast out of the circle of faith that they are outside the story of Jesus.

406
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,600
 No one.

407
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,400
 And if that doesn't encourage you today, I don't know what will.

408
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:43,040
 That no one is disqualified from the grace and the mercy of a God who was born in a damp,

409
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:51,520
 dark cave to give us the message that no matter how damp, dark, and cave-like our hearts might

410
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,560
 be, Jesus can be born in there too.

411
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,520
 His life can come alive in us.

412
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,600
 That in fact, I think actually Jesus likes to search out those that seem more messed

413
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,680
 up than others and say, "You're my child.

414
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,140
 You.

415
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,920
 I love you.

416
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,760
 And I am here for you."

417
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,000
 And the beauty of the genealogy of Jesus, in fact, the beauty of every genealogy is

418
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,480
 that it tells you the people that come to form someone.

419
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,680
 But then you can flip it because that person then becomes the starting point of more that

420
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
 would come from them.

421
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
 Do you follow that?

422
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,160
 So genealogy goes up towards the person, but then the genealogy goes beyond the person

423
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,120
 outwards from them.

424
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,340
 And every single person who's in this room right now who's a Christian, you're a part

425
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,640
 of now the family line, the bloodline, if you will, of Jesus.

426
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,560
 Not the literal bloodline, but the blood that was shed on the cross to pay the price for

427
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
 your sin.

428
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,200
 And as we come into saving recognition of that, and we ask God to forgive us of our

429
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,800
 sins and we grow in that, then we are a part of his family.

430
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,720
 He says, "You are not the same person that you were before.

431
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
 You're a new creation.

432
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
 You're my son.

433
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
 You're my daughter.

434
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
 You're my child.

435
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
 You're a child of God.

436
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
 You are in this story now."

437
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,320
 Isn't that beautiful?

438
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,640
 So the reason why Matthew and Luke start with this story of a broken, messy background to

439
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,640
 Jesus is because they're trying to say something.

440
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:27,080
 That the family that Jesus was from anticipates the family he's come for.

441
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,560
 Do you follow that?

442
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:36,800
 The family that Jesus is from anticipates the family that he's come for.

443
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:43,880
 You and I, who are equally as messed up and as broken as some of those people in the list

444
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:51,440
 right there, and yet who are not disqualified, and who are ones that God now turns to and

445
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,120
 says, "I choose you.

446
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,760
 That you are going to be a part of this thing called the church.

447
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,760
 This thing filled with kind of messy people who know that they have a God who has saved

448
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,400
 them and redeemed them and have hope now."

449
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,960
 See, as Christians, we don't worship the mess.

450
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,560
 We don't go, "Oh, look at all my brokenness.

451
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,080
 Look at all my sin."

452
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,000
 Paul says, "In recognition of the grace of God, do I continue to just go on sinning?"

453
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 No.

454
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,640
 We don't worship the mess, but we realize that we are part of the mess and that Jesus

455
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,080
 comes and redeems us out of that mess.

456
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,440
 And as he pulls us out of it, we then have a story to tell.

457
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:36,040
 Christmas should be the most powerful, gospel, evangelistic story that could ever be told

458
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:42,400
 to a broken and desperate world, but we've allowed the world to strip Jesus from it.

459
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,560
 Happy holidays.

460
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,840
 When actually Christmas should be the time where the church rises up and says, "There's

461
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,440
 a better story to be told.

462
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,880
 There's a story about the mess of the world and the mess of humanity and the God who is

463
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:04,880
 not afraid of that mess, a God who steps into that mess and does something about it, who

464
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:11,200
 invites us to experience his love even in the mess."

465
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,720
 I love how the scholar Raymond Brown puts it.

466
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
 He wrote this.

467
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,440
 He said, "The God who wrote the beginnings with crooked lines also writes the sequence

468
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,440
 with crooked lines, and some of those lines are our own lives in witness.

469
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,560
 A God who did not hesitate to use the scheming as well as the noble, the impure as well as

470
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,820
 the pure, men to whom the world hearkened and women upon whom the world frowned.

471
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:40,000
 This God continues to work through the same glorious mess of people."

472
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,660
 Isn't that beautiful?

473
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:49,720
 This God continues to work through the same glorious mess of people, the Vine Church in

474
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,920
 Hong Kong.

475
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,360
 That fills me with joy.

476
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,840
 That's the gospel.

477
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,040
 That actually is Christmas.

478
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:05,120
 On your way out in a moment, I want to encourage you to go down the main stairs of the building,

479
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,460
 particularly if you didn't have time to look at them on the way up.

480
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,640
 If you're in the upper house, I might want to encourage you guys to come and do that

481
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,080
 even though you might escape through the lift or some other way at the end.

482
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,300
 Not escape, that was the wrong word.

483
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,600
 You go in the lift.

484
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,280
 You're more than welcome to use the lift anytime.

485
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
 I will not think you're escaping.

486
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,720
 The lift is good.

487
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,640
 But you might want to come down the stairs and come down the main thing because what

488
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,800
 we've done is we've wanted to visually represent everything I've been talking about today and

489
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,200
 what this series is all about through what we call cabinets of curiosity or rooms of

490
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
 wonder.

491
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,160
 They're famous in the 16th century to help people to experience the wonder of the world.

492
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,840
 We, our creative team, have made four of these that are down there on the stairs.

493
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,320
 You can look at them on the way out.

494
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,760
 And we've put specific things inside of them because they represent what I'm talking about.

495
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,400
 They represent the reality that on the outside, we're structured and we have a certain way

496
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,160
 and we project a certain image.

497
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,480
 But on the inside is all the stuff.

498
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,660
 Some of it which we're happy for people to see.

499
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,280
 Some of it we're not happy for people to see.

500
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:15,800
 But in that, we have a gateway to the need for the gospel of Jesus and the need for the

501
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,000
 hope that he brings us by his love and in his power.

502
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,560
 And so as we come to look at these little cabinets of curiosity, I wonder you might

503
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,760
 reflect a little bit on the curiousness of your mess in you.

504
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,840
 And it's an invitation for you to bring that mess to him.

505
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,680
 And what we're going to do every step of this series is give you an opportunity to bring

506
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,000
 a certain type or kind of mess to God.

507
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,420
 And I believe that as we get to the end of the series and as we get to Christmas Day,

508
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:52,220
 you will find yourself living out the Christmas story so much better than ever before.

509
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,400
 It is not a misdirection.

510
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,720
 Instead what Matthew and Luke do is they're like, "I'm not going to do this by the way."

511
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,080
 But if they took this and went like that, they basically rip it all off and they say,

512
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,680
 "This is how it really is because in this, there is hope."

513
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,240
 For you in this room online right now, everybody in the overflow, no matter how sinful you

514
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,360
 are, there is hope.

515
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,800
 No matter how broken you are, there is hope.

516
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,920
 No matter how forgotten you are, there is hope.

517
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,400
 No matter how mistreated you have been in your life, there is hope.

518
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,200
 That's the gospel message of Jesus.

519
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
 That's what Christmas is all about.

520
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,920
 So may we enjoy the mess this year.

521
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,800
 One of the greatest messes you'll ever encounter is the mess of Christmas Day.

522
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,280
 Do not be too quick to clean it up.

523
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
 Can I pray for you?

524
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,920
 Let's pray.

525
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:53,320
 Father, I am so grateful for the people in this room.

526
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:59,520
 I'm so grateful for every person who holds a different story.

527
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:07,600
 I'm grateful, Lord, that you have provided for us all a gateway, an entry point to you.

528
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:19,000
 That your birth in Bethlehem some 2,000 years ago in a sequence of messy events is really

529
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,840
 our opportunity to experience your welcome in our lives.

530
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,200
 So I want to pray for a few kinds of people in this room as our eyes are closed and our

531
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
 heads are bowed.

532
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,640
 Some of you in this room, you don't know Jesus.

533
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,320
 Maybe when you came in here this morning, you wouldn't have said that you were a Christian.

534
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,680
 Maybe someone's invited you here, or maybe you feel like you had a relationship with

535
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:54,920
 God in the past, but that's gone and you're wondering how to get it back.

536
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,120
 The message that I brought today is a message of hope for you.

537
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,160
 You don't need to get yourself cleaned up before you can meet Jesus.

538
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,800
 And some of you, that's a real message for you today.

539
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,400
 Some of you are thinking, "Well, once I get through that divorce or I stop doing that

540
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,920
 thing there, or once I just become a little bit of a better person, then I can be a Christian

541
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,920
 and come to church."

542
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:27,720
 The message today, the message of Christmas is no matter how messed up you are right now,

543
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,920
 you are welcome here.

544
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,560
 You're a part of our community.

545
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,480
 But more importantly, Jesus loves you.

546
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,920
 He's for you, and He can help you.

547
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,480
 And so maybe some of you in this room right now or online, you want to give your life

548
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,980
 to Jesus for the very first time.

549
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,240
 You've never done that before, but this is a moment for you.

550
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,940
 So whilst our eyes are closed and our heads are bowed, I want to give you an opportunity

551
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,160
 to respond today.

552
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,800
 Perhaps right now your heart is just beating a little bit faster because you know that

553
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,440
 God is with you in this, that He's inviting you to a relationship with Him.

554
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,920
 And you may not have all the answers.

555
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:13,760
 You may not know all the things, but you do know in this moment that you want to meet

556
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,480
 a God who can meet you right where you are.

557
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,200
 So if you've never given your life to Jesus before, I want to give you an opportunity

558
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,120
 to do that, and I'm going to pray for you in a moment.

559
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,000
 Whilst our eyes are closed, heads are bowed, you have an opportunity to start this New

560
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,360
 Advent series and season in the right place.

561
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,840
 So if that's you, I want to just encourage you just really quickly, just put your hand

562
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,760
 up so I can see you, so I can pray for you personally.

563
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
 Anybody here in the lower house?

564
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,680
 In the upper house as well, just put your hand up so I can see it.

565
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,960
 Great, see that hand, thank you.

566
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,040
 Anyone else want to join my sister?

567
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,720
 Yeah, I see that as well, thank you.

568
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,360
 I can't really see the upper house, but we have pastors up there who can see you if you

569
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,360
 have raised your hand.

570
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,680
 I want to pray for those two people that I've seen, and maybe some people in the upper house

571
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,680
 as well.

572
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,200
 Father, I thank you so much for these two, Lord, who Lord, have brought themselves to

573
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,320
 a place today to meet you.

574
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,680
 And we're all going to pray as one church together now, but those two in the upper house,

575
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,160
 if it's you as well, I want you just to pray after me.

576
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,680
 We're all going to do it out loud, so you guys are a part of it, but it's particularly

577
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
 for you guys.

578
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,160
 So we're all going to pray this together, let's pray.

579
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:50,840
 Lord Jesus, I want to thank you for coming to earth, for being born 2000 years ago, so

580
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,400
 I could know you.

581
00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:01,080
 Thank you for being born into the mess, into my mess.

582
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,520
 Thank you.

583
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:12,800
 I ask that you would come now and meet me, forgive me and help me.

584
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:22,920
 I ask for your Holy Spirit to be in me and with me and helping me.

585
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:31,040
 And I thank you that my new life starts today in Jesus' name.

586
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
 Amen.

587
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
 Amen.

588
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,040
 Well, if you've prayed that prayer here in the room and in the upper house, do come and

589
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,600
 talk to me afterwards at one of our passes.

590
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,160
 We'd love to pray with you.

591
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,520
 Everybody else, I want you to bow your heads and close your eyes again, sorry, because

592
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,200
 we're not done yet.

593
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,040
 And so this is now for everybody else here who's already a Christian.

594
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,000
 I know some of you are from really broken homes.

595
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,260
 I know that because I'm your pastor and our pastoral team spends time with you guys.

596
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:05,440
 Some of you are from really difficult, challenging family backgrounds.

597
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,640
 Some of you have been deeply hurt by those in your family.

598
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,880
 And some of you, you've been really impacted and affected over the years by the brokenness

599
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,120
 in your family.

600
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,840
 And I pray today as we take a bit of a look at the brokenness of Jesus' family, that you

601
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,900
 would find hope renewed in you today, that you would know that there is a God who knows

602
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:38,000
 what it is that you're going through, who knows how hard that it is being for you, and

603
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,760
 a God who wants to come and walk with you.

604
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,280
 He's not a God who always necessarily suddenly makes everything better, doesn't always suddenly

605
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,280
 change our circumstances or situations, but He does guarantee His presence with you in

606
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,200
 whatever it is that you are facing right now and will need to face.

607
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,080
 So if you're from a broken home or a challenging family backgrounds, know that the love of

608
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,040
 God and the presence of God is with you.

609
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,840
 And Lord, I want to pray for my family here, whether that's their reality.

610
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,980
 Father, I pray that they would feel hope renewed in them, that they are now swept up in a family

611
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,400
 that you're a part of, that you started, that as we carry the name of Christ, we do so as

612
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,480
 part of your family, your sons and daughters, your children.

613
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,840
 And Father, I want to pray lastly for anyone here who's hurt people.

614
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:36,720
 You know, in the list of Jesus' genealogy are those that have been mistreated.

615
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,600
 We know, Lord, that sometimes we have done that ourselves.

616
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,560
 Maybe some of our family issues are at our doorstep.

617
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:50,040
 Maybe we were the perpetrators of some of the broken relationships in our families and

618
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,720
 some of the things that we're not proud of.

619
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,760
 Maybe we're the reason why there's been some brokenness amongst the people we love the

620
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
 most.

621
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,160
 And I want to pray for you, if that's you in this room, that you would know the grace

622
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,680
 and the forgiveness of a God who forgives you so that you might be able to have the

623
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:17,360
 strength to move forward and invite and ask for forgiveness for those that you have hurt.

624
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,720
 The Lord's Prayer, forgive us our sins as we forgive those who have sinned against us.

625
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,440
 And I think the Gospels would further add as we invite and ask for forgiveness for those

626
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
 that we've hurt.

627
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,620
 And so I want to pray for anyone here who recognizes that they've played that kind of

628
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,620
 role in their family.

629
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:42,380
 That Lord, I just ask that you would give them the strength, Lord.

630
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,980
 This humility, Lord, to seek reconciliation where it's possible.

631
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,340
 May not be possible in every circumstance, but where it's possible, Lord, give them the

632
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,700
 courage to do that.

633
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,640
 And Father, as we stand with this thought today, we're thankful that you minister to

634
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,820
 us in multiple different ways.

635
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,660
 It's all for your glory and for your grace.
