1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
 Grateful for this moment to gather both here in the room and online, Lord.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,360
 Grateful that your presence is at work and moving amongst us.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,480
 Lord, we pray for every home right now that is watching this live feed.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,160
 Lord, we thank you so much for the people that are gathered in communities around the

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,960
 world and here in Hong Kong.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,360
 Lord, we thank you that our church is not just contained to these four walls.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:30,240
 And so we just lift up prayer for each home, for each story, for each person.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,280
 Father we pray that you would reach them right now.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,840
 Lord, that we are so grateful that we get to be a community in person, online, together,

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
 one unified body of Christ.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,920
 And Father, I thank you for each person in this room, for their story, for their journey,

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,240
 for what's happening in their lives right now.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,760
 Lord, we've loved your presence with us.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,320
 But as we open your word, we know that we are therefore opening your presence at a deeper

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,800
 level.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,240
 Because you say that you are the logos, you are the word.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,480
 So as we open your scriptures, as we open story, as we open up principles of theology,

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,040
 Lord, would you be even more present with us.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,960
 And Lord, we celebrate that, we're excited about that, and we pray this in Jesus' name.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,360
 Everyone says?

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
 Amen.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
 Amen.

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,800
 Let's give it up for the worship team for, oh man.

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,360
 Have a seat, have a seat.

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,560
 Well what an amazing time.

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,280
 I'm so excited.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,080
 Real human people in the room.

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
 Hi.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,360
 How are you all?

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,680
 Are you guys good?

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
 It's so good to see you.

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
 Welcome to the Upper House.

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
 How are you guys?

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,960
 Everybody doing all right up there?

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
 Beautiful.

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
 You guys look amazing.

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
 Socially spread out and amazing.

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
 I love that.

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,360
 That's beautiful.

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,280
 I'm carrying in my spirit something that I'm really excited to preach to you guys today

41
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
 about.

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,440
 I've been saying this so many times, I'm going to keep saying it.

43
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,640
 There is never, I think in the whole of the history of Hong Kong, never a more important

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,280
 time to be Christian in our city than right now.

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:14,400
 I'm so excited about where we are as the church and what is ahead of us in the years ahead

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
 for the gospel in our city.

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,560
 No more important time for us to lean into the reality of what it is that we've been

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,320
 saved for.

49
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,720
 What it is that we get to gather in this room and sing praises for.

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,480
 We have to ask ourselves, is it just for us?

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,300
 Is what we're doing here just for this moment of 90 minutes?

52
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,240
 Or does it have something to say to everything that's taking place in not just our city in

53
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,200
 Hong Kong, but around the world right now?

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:51,240
 I believe that the Christian faith is the most profoundly important thing for this world

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
 in this hour.

56
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:59,440
 And I want to open up for us today as we start this new series and over the next seven weeks,

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,880
 what I think it is to live the Christian faith in this moment.

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,520
 I want to tell you a little bit about your story.

59
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,280
 I want to talk to you about the gospel and about what it is that you've been saved for.

60
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,880
 I want to challenge you also over the next seven weeks to rise up, to begin to be a voice

61
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,840
 of God's gospel in everything that is happening around us.

62
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,200
 I want to call you to be different.

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
 Are you ready?

64
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,800
 Let me start with a story.

65
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,160
 Twenty years ago, twenty years ago.

66
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
 I'm old.

67
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,360
 It's always dangerous when you start a story with twenty years ago.

68
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,400
 Twenty years ago, I led a small group of teenagers of youth from the Vine on a missions trip

69
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,260
 to the slums of Manila.

70
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,600
 We were partnering with YWAM, visiting this particular part of metro Manila.

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,560
 It's not there anymore, but in those days, twenty years ago, there was this place called

72
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
 Smoky Mountain.

73
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,640
 I don't know if you've ever heard of Smoky Mountain.

74
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,400
 It was famous around the world as being the world's largest rubbish dump.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,280
 It was right there in the middle of metro Manila.

76
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,520
 It looked exactly like this.

77
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:17,040
 This huge rubbish tip had four thousand people that lived on it and made their lives from

78
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,120
 it, scavenging on the rubbish tip day in, day out, gathering things up so they could

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,800
 take it and sell it and make a livelihood.

80
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,360
 Our mission for a week, partnering with YWAM, was to go and do outreach to the four thousand

81
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,280
 people that were on this rubbish tip.

82
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,040
 There was this basketball court, a couple of basketball courts right by the side of

83
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
 Smoky Mountain.

84
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,960
 Now, you know in the Philippines, everything starts around basketball, right?

85
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,640
 There was these basketball courts, and we would go and we would hold outreach on these

86
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,760
 basketball courts for the people that were working and living, the children, the families

87
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
 on Smoky Mountain.

88
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,240
 Well, on this one particular day, we thought that traffic in Manila was going to be really

89
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
 bad.

90
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,920
 Who's faced traffic in Manila?

91
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,200
 You know it's bad, the worst in the world.

92
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,580
 We thought it was going to be really bad, and so we went super early, but I guess God

93
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,680
 liked the Red Sea, parted the traffic for us.

94
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,120
 And we got there 45 minutes early.

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,800
 And we all got out of the van, there's me and like 10 kids, and I'm like the youth pastor

96
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,000
 going, "What are we going to do for 45 minutes with all these youth that are kind of just

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,160
 like, you know, wondering what's next?"

98
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,280
 And I look up and I notice that around Smoky Mountain, right where we were by the basketball

99
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,160
 courts was this temporary housing unit.

100
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,360
 And in this temporary housing unit, there were five or six homes that were on these

101
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
 rickety kind of bamboo structures.

102
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,960
 And so I got this idea, "Okay, why don't we go up and we'll knock on the doors of these

103
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,520
 families and we'll go in there and we'll introduce ourselves and we'll share a little bit and

104
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,920
 we'll pray for them as families."

105
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,320
 We thought this was a great idea, so I got all the youth and they were super excited.

106
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,040
 We walked up these rickety staircases and we knocked on the first door and we went in

107
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,320
 and we're like, "Hi, we're from Hong Kong."

108
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,040
 You know, and this family was like, "What is going on?"

109
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,640
 You know, and then we would tell them a little bit about Jesus and we would pray for them

110
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
 as a family.

111
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,480
 We'd go out and we'd knock on the next door and we kept on doing this.

112
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,840
 And by the time we got to the last door, we had about seven minutes left before we were

113
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,920
 supposed to be on the basketball court to do our outreach.

114
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,260
 And I said to the team, "Okay, guys, we don't have a lot of time with this family.

115
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
 We're just going to knock on the door.

116
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,260
 We're going to go in.

117
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,260
 We're going to say hi.

118
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,840
 We're going to pray real quick and then we're going to funnel out and get on with the outreach

119
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
 downstairs."

120
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
 And everybody was ready for it.

121
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
 We opened the door, we went in.

122
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,260
 As soon as we stepped into this last room, we recognized that this was different from

123
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,260
 all the other ones.

124
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,760
 It was immediately just darker and dingier.

125
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,320
 There was like this curtain that was pulled across the window, the only window in the

126
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 hut.

127
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,040
 And as we walked up, we found and discovered this old couple, probably in their mid-80s,

128
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,900
 sitting there on a bed.

129
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,160
 And we noticed the man straight away because he had these two milky white type cataracts

130
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,240
 over his eyes.

131
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,880
 And we could tell that he was blind.

132
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,260
 And so we said through an interpreter, "Can you tell us your story?"

133
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,220
 And he said, "Well, I've lived here on Smoky Mountain for 15 years.

134
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,120
 And during that time, because of the way that the sun comes and combusts all the things

135
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,380
 on Smoky Mountain, all of the smoke has ruined my eyesight and I can no longer see.

136
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,080
 I've got two full cataracts on my eyes from all of that smoke for all of those years and

137
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
 I can't see anymore."

138
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,020
 And we had this real compassion for him.

139
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,780
 And I said, "Okay, guys, well, let's just pray for this family.

140
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,420
 Let's pray for God's blessing."

141
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,120
 And so we kind of stretched our hands out.

142
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,820
 I was doing the kind of pray, check my watch prayer because I needed to get down for this

143
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,140
 outreach.

144
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,300
 And we finished the prayer and I started to funnel the kids out real quick.

145
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,980
 And as all the kids go out, the last girl in our youth ministry, she was 14 years old.

146
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,960
 And she stands in the door as I'm trying to usher her out of the house.

147
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,820
 And she says to me, "I believe God wants to heal this man."

148
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,680
 Uh-oh.

149
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,760
 This is like every youth pastor's worst nightmare.

150
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,980
 This is like a lose-lose situation, right?

151
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,980
 Because if I don't pretend to have as much faith as she's got, I look like the loser,

152
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,980
 right?

153
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,780
 Equally, if we go in there, I know that on the whole, I've experienced, I know that God's

154
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,140
 probably not going to heal this person.

155
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,340
 I know that's probably not going to happen.

156
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,740
 And so therefore, I'm going to have to spend the rest of the afternoon trying to describe

157
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,420
 theologically to these kids why God doesn't always heal when we have faith.

158
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,140
 And I'm going through all of this and she's standing there with these big doe eyes going,

159
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,260
 "I believe God can heal this man."

160
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,380
 I'm looking at my watch and I'm going, "All right, everybody back in the room, back in

161
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,380
 the room.

162
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,380
 Come on, come on quickly.

163
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,380
 Okay, okay, just say a prayer for him.

164
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,380
 Come on, let's go."

165
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,380
 You know?

166
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,900
 So she gathers around and we all gather around and she puts her little hand on this guy's

167
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,060
 shoulder and she offers the simplest prayer.

168
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,300
 I don't remember exactly what it was.

169
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,100
 It was something like, "God, would you just heal this man?"

170
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,460
 And what happened next is kind of hard to describe.

171
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,580
 The best way I could describe it is, it's a little bit like if you've got a car and

172
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,020
 your windshield of your car is completely dirty and you turn on the windscreen wipers

173
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,420
 and it goes like this and cleans all that dirt away.

174
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:11,100
 Like literally as I'm staring at this man, the cataracts in his eyes, the milky whiteness

175
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,620
 just is wiped away.

176
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:22,400
 And I'm like, "Oh, I don't believe what has just happened."

177
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,140
 And this is a real gritty, real life miracle.

178
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,860
 Not like ones that we read in the Bible.

179
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,460
 This is really happening in this moment.

180
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,420
 And because it's a real miracle, this man has not had light enter his eyes for about

181
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,420
 15 years.

182
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,820
 So suddenly all this light is flooding into his system.

183
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,500
 It freaks him out.

184
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
 He goes, "Ahhhh!"

185
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,460
 And he grabs his eyes and he starts screaming as loud as he can.

186
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,020
 And his wife starts screaming right next to him.

187
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,820
 The kids start screaming.

188
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,100
 I'm screaming as well.

189
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,780
 It's a scream fest.

190
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,780
 And this man's like, "Ahhhh!"

191
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,780
 Like this.

192
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:05,580
 And then slowly, he's got his hands over his eyes and then he lets them down slowly and

193
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,660
 he's squinting and he's in like a little bit of pain and he's singing.

194
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,840
 And he starts to count us in the room.

195
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,960
 And his wife starts to weep and weep and we're all weeping and weeping.

196
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,480
 And I'm like, "Forget the outreach."

197
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,340
 Like God's kingdom has come on earth as it is in heaven.

198
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,340
 It's literally invaded this moment and in this life.

199
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,760
 And then God has turned and changed and transformed this man.

200
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,300
 And I'm there and I realize it's all because some 14-year-old girl had something different

201
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,600
 in her.

202
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,460
 Something different from her youth pastor.

203
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,600
 That she was carrying something in her that set her apart.

204
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,340
 That she could stare deformity in its face and go, "I think I know a God who can do something

205
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,020
 about that."

206
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:11,140
 That she might carry something in her that was so different from the rest of us that

207
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:18,460
 God honors the reality that she was courageous enough to declare the promises of God when

208
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:24,460
 all I wanted to do was get to a basketball court.

209
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,900
 This series that we're starting today, I believe is the central word for what God has for the

210
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,180
 Vine in this hour that we're in.

211
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,440
 There is no more important time for us to begin to realize, to remember, to celebrate

212
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,680
 that we have something in us.

213
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,140
 That means that we are different to the things that are around us in this world.

214
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,220
 If you think about all the things that are happening right now in our city, I believe

215
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,900
 that we are in an inflection point for the gospel right now in Hong Kong.

216
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,780
 That I think we're literally on a precipice where we're either going to move forward as

217
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:06,620
 the church in this city, holding the gospel loud and proud, or we're going to move back

218
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,140
 and we're going to lose a generation to Jesus.

219
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,820
 I think we're at an inflection point because of everything that's taking place pandemic

220
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,660
 and politically right now.

221
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,260
 This city is still hurting.

222
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,200
 This city is still trying to work out what its identity is moving forward.

223
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,700
 There are people in this city that are scared and fearful.

224
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,860
 There are people in this city who are wondering, "Is it time to pack up the bags and go?"

225
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,580
 Perhaps some of us are wrestling with that in this room right now.

226
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,140
 There are people in this city that are hurting and still confused and wondering what's next.

227
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,980
 I think the church has to ask itself a really important question.

228
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:51,580
 Will we, the church in Hong Kong, become a bold and central voice of hope and faith and

229
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,020
 life and love in this time for the years ahead?

230
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:05,500
 Or will we feebly shrink back into the shadows of our own self-concern and self-preservation?

231
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,580
 Will the church in Hong Kong stand up and stand out?

232
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,180
 Will it shrink back and fade out?

233
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:22,500
 Will the church begin to actually live out the gospel the way that it was always designed

234
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
 to be?

235
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,420
 Or will we settle for a gospel that keeps the lights on in here but shuts down our light

236
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,000
 out there?

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,020
 Come on, church.

238
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:38,180
 There's an inflection point right now in our city.

239
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,180
 Let me tell you this.

240
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,340
 Jesus didn't die on the cross so that we could enjoy a nice Christian holy huddle.

241
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:53,420
 Jesus didn't die on the cross so that Christians would just know comfort and safety and security.

242
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,380
 I want to misquote C.S. Lewis here.

243
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,940
 I don't know if that's a thing, but I'm going to do it.

244
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,460
 I'm going to misquote him by saying this.

245
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,220
 The Christian faith is good, but it's not safe.

246
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,980
 Jesus died on the cross not for our comfort.

247
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:15,700
 Jesus died on the cross to create a new humanity, to begin the starting point of a new story,

248
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,740
 to create something within the mess and the brokenness that is different from it, that

249
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,500
 brings a hope, that brings a story and a narrative that begins to say something to that brokenness

250
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 around.

251
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,660
 Jesus' death and resurrection was a declaration that God's not getting rid of all of the

252
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,900
 mess, but he's starting afresh within it.

253
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,980
 Paul would speak of Jesus as the new Adam, the starting point of a new story, of a new

254
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,940
 invitation, and that Jesus himself would say in all of his teachings before he got to the

255
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:52,060
 cross, "I am here to start, to bring, to declare the kingdom of God."

256
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,060
 In other words, my death on the cross is going to create what I like to call an alternative

257
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:05,260
 society, something about a new group of people that live within the rest of society, don't

258
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:11,260
 separate from it, don't go to be a monastery on a hill or birth within it, but are different

259
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,260
 to it.

260
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:19,700
 I believe God is going to heal this man.

261
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,740
 Jesus spoke about this alternative society a lot, the kingdom of God, the reign of God

262
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,740
 on earth.

263
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,140
 In Matthew chapter 13, he tells us a bunch of stories about it.

264
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,700
 My favorite is this, the kingdom of God, this thing that Jesus died and rose again for,

265
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,220
 the thing that we get to call ourselves Christian around, it's like this.

266
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,620
 It's like a little piece of yeast being placed in a large amount of dough.

267
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,460
 It's very small, but because it's in this large amount of dough and because it's different

268
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,820
 from that dough, when it gets kneaded over time, over a long period of time, guess what?

269
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,460
 Something so small can actually influence the whole dough and literally transform it

270
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,460
 into bread.

271
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,020
 Jesus is saying, "Do you want to know what this kingdom is like?

272
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,180
 Why I'm dying and rising again?

273
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,660
 Just so that there would be something different in you.

274
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,980
 So you might be like a piece of yeast, placed in your school or in your family or in your

275
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,300
 workplace or in your city.

276
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:25,780
 And over a period of time, God can take our differentness and begin to work and influence

277
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,780
 in society.

278
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,540
 The problem is, I think the church for so long, and particularly the modern church,

279
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,820
 has misinterpreted that parable and they said, "Oh, the church is like dough in dough."

280
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,420
 I mean, if we want to be relevant in this world, well, we just need to look a little

281
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
 bit more like the world.

282
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,020
 We need to do things a little bit like them, but even better than them.

283
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,180
 It means we need to imitate and copy what's happening in the world, but slap a Christian

284
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,340
 label on it.

285
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,220
 We've come to think that our faith is dough in dough.

286
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,260
 But Jesus is like, "Be different.

287
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,620
 That I'm starting in you a different story.

288
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,620
 Not be weird."

289
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,940
 Us Christians have struggled with this one as well.

290
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,260
 He didn't say, "Be weird."

291
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,700
 We've all got the uncle, haven't we, in our family, right?

292
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,100
 You know, the weird uncle, right?

293
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,860
 That like no one knows what to do with and comes to the annual family barbecue and stands

294
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,380
 in the corner and smells a little bit, right?

295
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,660
 That's not us, okay?

296
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,020
 We're not supposed to be weird, but we are supposed to carry something different.

297
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,220
 What is the different thing that we carry?

298
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,580
 Jesus' hope, Jesus' forgiveness, Jesus' love.

299
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,620
 As we begin to love one another, we begin to show the world what that love looks like.

300
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,820
 As we carry the hope that we've been redeemed, we realize it's not just for us, but it's

301
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,820
 for everyone else.

302
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,740
 And we begin to speak of that hope boldly and courageously so that others might know

303
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,100
 the character and the person of God.

304
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,180
 The difference is not us.

305
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,940
 The difference is Jesus.

306
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,900
 And we get to make Jesus known.

307
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:04,460
 I don't want to do anything else with my life but that.

308
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,580
 The great powerful audacity of the Christian faith is that through a relationship with

309
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:16,220
 Christ Jesus, we get to declare to the world that we are yeast in dough, a light in the

310
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,820
 darkness, a city on a hill.

311
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,980
 And we get to live out the realities of what that looks like.

312
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,980
 What does it mean for us to be different in Hong Kong in this time where there is fear,

313
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,220
 we might move in courage.

314
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,500
 Where there is uncertainty and concern, we might declare faith.

315
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,100
 Where there is slavery, we might break chains.

316
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:46,820
 That we might become the church that God died for.

317
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,460
 I think we're at an inflection point where as a church we get to decide if that's what

318
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
 we want or not.

319
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:58,900
 And whether we're going to have our voice be heard.

320
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,140
 There's a lot of stories in Scripture around holding this different type of approach.

321
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,580
 I call it a different spirit.

322
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,780
 What I want to challenge us in over the next seven weeks is what it is to hold a different

323
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
 spirit.

324
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,220
 Again, not to be weird or strange or different for different sake, but to realize that in

325
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,060
 the story of the gospel and in the power of the spirit alive in us, there is something

326
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,100
 different that we carry that has something to say of hope in the world around us.

327
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,860
 This different spirit is throughout Scripture, Old and New Testament.

328
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,340
 What we're going to do over these seven weeks is we're going to park ourselves in one story

329
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,020
 in the Old Testament.

330
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,980
 It's one of the most famous stories of the Old Testament.

331
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,820
 It's found in Numbers chapter 13 and 14.

332
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,460
 It's the story of the 12 spies being sent out to spy Canaan, the promised land that

333
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,460
 had been promised to them.

334
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,700
 And what we're going to do is we're going to go week by week through this story together,

335
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,420
 and I'm going to show you what a different spirit looks like because I want to empower

336
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:02,620
 us and release us to live that different spirit in our city today.

337
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:08,920
 Let me give you some context to this story as an introduction this morning.

338
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,580
 We know that God has released Israel from their slavery in Egypt, and He's done it through

339
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,840
 compassion.

340
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,180
 He's done it miraculously.

341
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,440
 He's parted the waters.

342
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,880
 He's brought them out, and they're now in their freedom.

343
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,620
 But freedom is not an easy thing.

344
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,700
 Freedom has responsibilities.

345
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,220
 And in that whole journey of slavery into freedom, God's been giving them one story

346
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,820
 the whole time.

347
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,100
 There's an inheritance for you.

348
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,580
 There's a land that I'm leading you to.

349
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,460
 There's a place where I'm going to be moving you into, a place that flows with milk and

350
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,220
 honey, a land that is a gift of God's people, that it's going to be a place for you to grow

351
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,240
 in, to learn in, to flourish, a safe environment where you get to show the world what God looks

352
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
 like.

353
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,880
 There's a land for you.

354
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,660
 And this dream and this vision and this promise of an inheritance of a land keeps Israel going.

355
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,780
 And now in Numbers 13 and 14, they're right at the Jordan River, and they can see the

356
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,060
 land just right there.

357
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,460
 And Moses does something really smart.

358
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,940
 Rather than just suddenly invading the land, he gets 12 of the best men from the different

359
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,940
 12 tribes of Israel.

360
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,100
 And he says to them, "I want you to go into the land and spy it out and come back and

361
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
 give us a report.

362
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,020
 Is this actually the land that God's promised to us?

363
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,780
 What is it like?"

364
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,140
 And so these 12 go out, and for 40 days, they spy out the land, they come back, and they

365
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,380
 give a report to Israel.

366
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,980
 And the report essentially is twofold.

367
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,480
 Number one, it is an amazing land.

368
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,260
 It does flow with milk and honey.

369
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,340
 There's incredible fruit in this land, and that fruit is good.

370
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,940
 Look, we've even brought some of that fruit back to show you this is an amazing place.

371
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
 What an inheritance.

372
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:52,380
 And then the second part of their report is, there's a but, right?

373
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,020
 You know you're in trouble when there's that.

374
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,900
 And they say, "But there's giants in that land.

375
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,260
 I mean, there's obstacles.

376
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,860
 There's fortified cities.

377
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,940
 There's stuff that's there in that land.

378
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,300
 We have to get to outreach in just a few moments of basketball court.

379
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,580
 There's distractions.

380
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,340
 There's things there that will stop us from moving in."

381
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,600
 And they begin to give this report that this is the end, that we've come all this way.

382
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,440
 Why has God let us out of slavery in Egypt and brought us here to be killed by the giants

383
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,460
 in the promised land?

384
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,840
 And fear begins to spread in the camp.

385
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:39,480
 In this time of our society and culture, in our world right now, fear spreads in the camp

386
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,240
 because of bad reports.

387
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,800
 I shudder to use the word fake news, but you're with me, right?

388
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
 Opinions.

389
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,080
 Everybody with a keyboard telling us what we should believe and think.

390
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,200
 Everybody telling us whether this virus is good or not, the vaccine is good or not.

391
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,480
 All these obstacles in communication and information, and we get swamped by it, and we get information

392
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,280
 fatigue, and it can lead us very easily into a place where we're no longer listening to

393
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:16,360
 the promises of God, and we're absorbing all of the commentary of the world.

394
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:23,320
 Two spies, though, are willing to say to Moses, "I believe God could heal this man."

395
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,400
 Two spies stand up and say, "Hm, hang on a sec.

396
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,680
 I mean, if this is a promise of God, if this is His land that He's giving to us, then I

397
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,240
 think we can take this land.

398
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,760
 Yeah, we see the obstacles, but you know what?

399
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,800
 Our God is bigger than that."

400
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,440
 There are two that begin to give a different voice to the situation, begin to stand up

401
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,120
 and say, "No, actually, we cannot forget that God is at work.

402
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
 We cannot forget.

403
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,280
 We see the obstacles.

404
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,000
 We see the giants, but there's something bigger than the giants.

405
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,720
 There's the God behind them, and that God is way more powerful, and if we could just

406
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,200
 believe that God could do this, then everything could..."

407
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:06,240
 And they begin to say, two voices out of the 12, that God is still with us.

408
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,200
 God sees all this happening, and He's like, "Okay."

409
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,960
 And He separates the 10 from the 2.

410
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,520
 And God says to the 10, "Because you are unfaithful, because you fail to believe, none of your

411
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,840
 descendants will ever enter the inheritance and the promise that I've given you."

412
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,960
 And He turns to the 2, and He says, "Because of you two, your descendants, your people

413
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,760
 will inherit the promises of God."

414
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:39,720
 I believe that Hong Kong as a city is God's promised land.

415
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,880
 I believe God has Hong Kong as an inheritance, that the gospel is still ripe for work in

416
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
 this city.

417
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,880
 Are we going to be the 10, or are we going to be the 2?

418
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,840
 Here's how God puts it in Numbers 14.

419
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,520
 Is everybody okay?

420
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
 You still like me?

421
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
 Good.

422
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,480
 Verse 21, it says this, "Surely as I live," this is God speaking, "and as surely as the

423
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,360
 glory of the Lord fills the whole earth," notice that, the whole earth, right?

424
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,600
 Including the promised land where the giants are.

425
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,280
 "Not one of the men who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I performed in Egypt, in

426
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,400
 the desert, but who disobeyed me and tested me 10 times, not one of them will ever see

427
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,100
 the land I promised on the oath to their forefathers.

428
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,820
 No one has treated me with contempt will ever see it.

429
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:35,120
 But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will

430
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,040
 bring him into the land that he went to and his descendants will inherit it because this

431
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,600
 one has a different spirit.

432
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,040
 This one carries something of my character.

433
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,120
 This one believes in my promises above what he sees in the world.

434
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,760
 This one and all of his descendants and his family will walk into that inheritance.

435
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
 This one."

436
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
 Why?

437
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,760
 Because he carried a different spirit.

438
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:09,760
 Caleb allowed his incredible vision of God and his understanding of God's power and his

439
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:17,280
 promises to filter into his thoughts and actions and his public expression of his faith.

440
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,000
 And God saw that and believed it was very, very good.

441
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,720
 Over the next seven weeks, I'm going to teach you about what I think this different spirit

442
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,640
 is all about.

443
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,760
 But I want to start today by telling you what the different spirit is not.

444
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,200
 Are you ready for this?

445
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,200
 A different spirit is not manufactured by the flesh.

446
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,440
 A different spirit is not something that we work up in us with some nice music or some

447
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,000
 rah-rah or some shouting.

448
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,080
 A different spirit is not something created in us.

449
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,680
 It is not our inner skills or our inner strength or our personal abilities.

450
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,720
 It is not the thing that I do that I do really well.

451
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,960
 My different spirit is not the strength that I have, even if that strength has come from

452
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,600
 my years of walking with Jesus.

453
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,120
 It's got nothing to do with the person or the gifts or the abilities of me.

454
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,960
 If that was the case, then when God showed up to these 12 people, he would have said

455
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,320
 they all had a different spirit.

456
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,600
 Because the 10 spies were the strongest, most courageous, bravest, best leaders of their

457
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
 tribes.

458
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,560
 That was why they were chosen to go into the promised land.

459
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,880
 But God doesn't say that.

460
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,720
 He says over here, these two have something different to the rest.

461
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,200
 So a different spirit has nothing to do with our abilities.

462
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,920
 Can I have an amen?

463
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:44,320
 A different spirit also is not a type A personality.

464
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,480
 A different spirit is not being extroverted.

465
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,320
 Can I have an amen, introverts?

466
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,600
 Now I might be an extrovert myself, but the reality is a different spirit is not about

467
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,000
 your ability to communicate, your ability to be passionate, how loud you raise your

468
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,040
 voice, how comfortable you are in social settings, whether you're a good leader or not.

469
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,160
 It's not about a personality profile.

470
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,680
 The Bible is filled with introverts that change the world.

471
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,800
 As hard as that is for me to say, it is true.

472
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,080
 Introverts everywhere in Scripture do amazing things.

473
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,800
 Moses, I can't go before Pharaoh because I stutter.

474
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,400
 I have no voice.

475
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
 Daniel, introvert.

476
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:35,360
 Amos, Barnabas, Timothy, Jude, John, ones that would prefer the quieter life are used

477
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,160
 so profoundly and powerfully in God's story.

478
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,560
 In fact, I would argue there are more introverts at work in Scripture than extroverts.

479
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:48,040
 So a different spirit has absolutely nothing to do with your personality profile.

480
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,840
 Are you with me?

481
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,320
 Here's the third thing.

482
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,320
 A different spirit is not about moral perfection or your amazing holiness.

483
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,640
 Now this is really important because I think as a church we can get foiled into this trap

484
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,640
 quite a lot.

485
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,600
 You're hearing me today and you're hearing what I'm saying and you're thinking, "Okay,

486
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
 I get it.

487
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,240
 I get that God can use other people of different abilities.

488
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,040
 I get that God can use other people of different kind of personality traits, but you don't

489
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,320
 know my story, Andrew.

490
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,540
 I'm an alcoholic.

491
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,960
 I struggle with lust issues.

492
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,560
 I'm cheating on my spouse right now.

493
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,480
 I have anger issues that I can't control.

494
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,440
 I lie on a regular basis."

495
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,680
 I mean, if you knew all the things that were happening in my life, you would realize that

496
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,680
 there's no different spirit in me.

497
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,880
 You'd realize that that's for the other people in church.

498
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,600
 I'm just going to come on a Sunday and just kind of slip in and slip out because I don't

499
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,840
 think I'm worthy of being a part of this grand idea of church that you're talking about.

500
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,920
 I want to speak to you if you're feeling a little bit like that today.

501
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,600
 I want you to know that there's nothing in this story.

502
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,280
 Yes, God says to Caleb, "Well, he followed me wholeheartedly."

503
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,680
 There was a sense of Caleb's devotion and worship to God, but there's nothing in this

504
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,240
 story about how perfectly moral and ethical Caleb was.

505
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,200
 In fact, I can tell you that probably Caleb was a man who struggled with stuff.

506
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,920
 Caleb probably wasn't perfect.

507
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,040
 Joshua definitely, as we will find out in his journey, was not perfect.

508
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:23,240
 David, a man after God's heart, was a murderer, a rapist, and an adulterer.

509
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,440
 When we see all of this in Scripture, it's there to remind us that even despite our brokenness,

510
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,880
 despite our sin, we can still be a part of God's alternative society.

511
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,200
 In fact, actually, maybe our struggles are a part of the jars of clay, this broken and

512
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,040
 brittleness that actually when we admit the reality of our sin and our struggle, we release

513
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,560
 something of the power of God's grace.

514
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,400
 Maybe a different spirit is at work despite the church's sin.

515
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,960
 Now, listen to me.

516
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,680
 I'm not soft on sin.

517
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,040
 The Holy Spirit wants us to operate and to walk in a sanctification process.

518
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:07,920
 I praise God that I'm not the sinner I was 10 years ago, 5 years ago, last month.

519
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:13,440
 But I also recognize that I still carry sin in my life, and I'm on a journey of sanctification.

520
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,400
 My heart is supple to the works of the Spirit.

521
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
 Here's the reality.

522
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,200
 Your struggle and your sin does not give you an excuse to opt out of God's alternative

523
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,580
 society from holding a different spirit.

524
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,880
 It's not about your moral perfection.

525
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,720
 It's about God's glory despite it.

526
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,760
 See a different spirit in the New Testament, if we center in on Jesus for a moment, it

527
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:47,280
 was all about this idea that He is everything, that the early church would be able to live

528
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,320
 the way they did in the empire around them by simply understanding that they have a God

529
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,600
 who is like this, one who was willing to come to the earth and die with it, one who was

530
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,600
 willing to resurrect around it, one who then returned to show us and gave us a spirit of

531
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,120
 life that that one is what they now stood up for.

532
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,680
 So Peter radically transformed, could stand before his people of his day and be a different

533
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,680
 spirit.

534
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
 Why?

535
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,800
 Just because suddenly, you know, Peter's got all these new gifts and abilities because

536
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,880
 Peter is suddenly not a sinner?

537
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,320
 No, because Peter realizes it's not about me.

538
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,040
 It's about Jesus.

539
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,800
 Because it's about Jesus, even in my brokenness, I can be a voice.

540
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,120
 I believe God can heal this man.

541
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,880
 I wonder whether we would be willing over the next seven weeks to stand over our city,

542
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:48,560
 join hands together and declare, we believe God could heal this city.

543
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
 That's a different spirit.

544
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,560
 Could you stand with me?

545
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
 I want to pray for you.

546
00:32:51,560 --> 00:33:00,600
 I wonder whether you just open your hands with me as we pray.

547
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:08,760
 Father, we come before you as a church, grateful for this invitation in this series to reflecting

548
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,440
 and thinking about what it is to live for Christ in this hour and in this time.

549
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:21,040
 Father, we stand before you now, open hearts, open hands.

550
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:30,280
 Father, some of us in this room, we rely far too much on our strengths and our abilities.

551
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,280
 Some of us in this room think we're disqualified because we're not a certain personality type

552
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,720
 or profile.

553
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,960
 Some of us in this room think we're disqualified because there's that sin that we continue

554
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,800
 to wrestle with.

555
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,600
 Some of us think that if we could just try a bit harder, embrace some work a bit more

556
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,680
 and be driven by the law, we think we might get there, but the law will enslave us.

557
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,600
 It sets us free.

558
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,480
 And so we come, Lord, at the start of this series with our hands open before you.

559
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,560
 Lord, I believe the Vine wants to be a church with a different spirit now.

560
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,920
 I believe in this inflection point of the gospel you're calling this church to stand

561
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:25,360
 up and stand out, to be a church that's willing to declare the gospel, the saving knowledge

562
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,240
 of Jesus Christ to a hurting and broken world.

563
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:37,280
 And Father, in all of our brokenness and all of our hope and strength, we now come to you.

564
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,240
 We ask that your spirit would light a fire in us, and that as we journey in this series

565
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:49,120
 together, we would learn through the examples of Caleb and Joshua, all of the things that

566
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:55,760
 you're saying to us in this hour.

567
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,760
 Make us, Lord, ones with a different spirit.

568
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,640
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

569
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
 Amen.

570
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
 Amen.

571
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
 Amen.

572
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
 Amen.

573
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,220
