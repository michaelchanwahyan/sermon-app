1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
 >> [INAUDIBLE]

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,360
 >> Help those that are in the overflow

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,800
 come and sit down, that's great.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,600
 Well, as you know, we're in a new sermon series.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,680
 We've started last week with Andrew as he shared on the person of the Holy Spirit.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,960
 And we're entering a series of really doing a teaching around who the Holy

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,200
 Spirit is, and so we're super excited about that.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,440
 And it's an honor to have with us today one of our elders.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,480
 Our elder has been with the Vine, her family have been part of the Vine for

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,760
 many, many, many years.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,640
 So would you give a very warm Vine welcome for Elder Susanna.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,360
 >> [APPLAUSE]

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,520
 >> And let's pray for Susanna.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,800
 Father, we thank you for Susanna and

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,720
 we thank you for the word that she has prayerfully prepared.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,400
 It is a word that she has surrendered to you.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,840
 And so we pray for her, we pray your blessing over her.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,280
 And we pray for us, that again, we would lean into what you are saying.

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,520
 And the truth of your word truly sets us free, in Jesus' name.

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,560
 >> Good morning.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,120
 And good morning to all of those who are joining online today.

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,440
 As Carla just said, we started a new series last week on the Holy Spirit.

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,240
 And I loved how Andrew focused in on and

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,640
 reminded us that the Holy Spirit is a person.

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:39,840
 And the Holy Spirit is a person whose role, since the very beginning of creation,

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,560
 has always been to bring order out of disorder.

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,640
 That beautiful picture in Genesis of the Holy Spirit hovering over the darkness and

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,200
 the chaos, ready to bring things fully alive.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,840
 And now, for those of us who've chosen Jesus, he's at work within us.

30
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:12,240
 The Holy Spirit willing and ready to move us out of darkness,

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,640
 to shape our chaos into the fullness of what we were intended to be.

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,160
 Today, we're going to explore the comfort and the conviction of the Holy Spirit.

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,840
 John 14, verses 16 to 17 says, and I will pray the Father,

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,680
 and he will give you another helper.

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,720
 And he may abide with you forever, the spirit of truth,

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,160
 whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him.

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,520
 But you know him, for he dwells with you.

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,480
 And will be in you.

39
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,120
 John 14, verse 26 says, but the helper,

40
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,600
 the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things.

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,720
 And bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.

42
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:19,280
 And then in John 16, verses 7 to 8, it says, nevertheless, I tell you the truth.

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,760
 It is to your advantage that I go away.

44
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,040
 For if I do not go away, the helper will not come to you.

45
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,760
 But if I depart, I will send him to you.

46
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,400
 And when he has come, he will convict the world of sin,

47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,360
 of righteousness, and of judgment.

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:48,120
 All three verses use the word helper to describe the Holy Spirit.

49
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,600
 The Greek word is parakletos, which translates as comforter or advocate.

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,240
 Someone who is called or sent to assist another.

51
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,560
 Someone who pleads the cause of another.

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,160
 Someone who's present to render various beneficial services.

53
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,200
 John would later, in 1 John 2, 1,

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,320
 use the very same word, parakletos, to describe Jesus.

55
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,720
 This connection has meaning.

56
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,840
 Jesus' words in John 16, 7 to 8,

57
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,000
 tell us that Jesus is leaving behind his earthly ministry,

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,520
 specifically so the Holy Spirit can act.

59
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,920
 The Holy Spirit, in a sense, does from the inside,

60
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,480
 what Christ was doing from the outside with his disciples.

61
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,800
 Teaching, convicting, reminding, comforting, and guiding.

62
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,920
 Let's unpack these verses.

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,240
 Sometimes, if you've been a Christian for a little while,

64
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,440
 it's easy to gloss over these verses and

65
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,600
 miss the enormity of what is taking place here.

66
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,440
 John 14, 16 to 7 teaches us that the Holy Spirit is given to us by the Father.

67
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,600
 That he will abide in us forever.

68
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,280
 He will dwell with us.

69
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,520
 He will be in us.

70
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,680
 If you believe in Jesus, if you've recognized your need of his saving love,

71
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,760
 and have chosen to give him your life, you have been given the gift

72
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,360
 of the Holy Spirit from the Father.

73
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,120
 The Holy Spirit is living within you.

74
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,120
 And this verse tells us that he will never leave you.

75
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,520
 He will abide with you forever.

76
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,760
 This Greek word abide, meno, means to remain,

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,000
 to stay, to continue to exist, and I love this last word.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,240
 It means to persist.

79
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,480
 I don't know about you, but I'm glad I have someone dwelling with me

80
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,320
 who persists with me and doesn't give up on me.

81
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,120
 Jesus said, it's to your advantage that I go away.

82
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,840
 Let's think about that for a minute.

83
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:38,320
 Jesus is saying that we get a better deal if he leaves and the Holy Spirit comes.

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,760
 It's to our advantage.

85
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,200
 I'm sure the disciples who were listening to this would have been thinking,

86
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,720
 that just can't be right.

87
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,160
 How can it be better if you go?

88
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,920
 You see, as long as Jesus was there in person,

89
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:06,440
 the object of the disciples' faith would always be a tangible, external person.

90
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,760
 Now that's not necessarily bad, however it means that they would have constantly

91
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,760
 depended on him to direct them to answer their questions.

92
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,600
 Their own thoughts and conscience would be perpetually pushed aside

93
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,680
 in favor of asking Jesus for his judgment and what he thought.

94
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,280
 When he was not physically present with them, they would have felt incomplete.

95
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,960
 In short, Jesus's physical presence in some sense,

96
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,280
 limited the depth of the disciples' reliance on God.

97
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,640
 It limited also how many people Jesus could influence at once.

98
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,760
 The Holy Spirit, on the other hand,

99
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,360
 completely fulfills the prophecy that's given in Jeremiah 31.

100
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,520
 It says, "Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord,

101
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,520
 when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.

102
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,520
 I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts.

103
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,000
 And I will be their God, they'll be my people, and no longer will they be

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,920
 my God, they'll be my people, and no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and

105
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,840
 each his brother saying, know the Lord, for they shall all know me.

106
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,360
 From the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord, for

107
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,600
 I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."

108
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,400
 The Holy Spirit, the helper, provides the ability for

109
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,200
 each of us to have a constant, a personal, and

110
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,560
 immediate, and indwelling contact with God.

111
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,400
 Instead of relying on someone outside of ourselves,

112
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,080
 believers in Christ can focus on the voice of God inside,

113
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,960
 inside their hearts as he dwells with them.

114
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,040
 Now this doesn't make us infallible or all-knowing.

115
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:16,880
 It does mean that we have the advantage of his influence.

116
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,600
 So far as we're willing to submit to it.

117
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,640
 Paul puts it like this,

118
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,240
 our bodies have now become the temple of the Holy Spirit.

119
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:35,080
 So as our helper, the Holy Spirit has this dual purpose to both comfort and convict.

120
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:42,080
 These words may seem to be opposites, but in fact, they can be intertwined.

121
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,040
 The conviction of the Holy Spirit in our response leads to his comfort,

122
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,920
 and the work of his comfort in our lives.

123
00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:00,720
 A key thing to really note here is, we can carry the Holy Spirit within us,

124
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,840
 and he will be actively working to both convict and comfort us.

125
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,920
 But it only works if we're listening.

126
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,160
 It only works if we're responding and submitting to him.

127
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,920
 It's also important to note that the comforting work of the Spirit

128
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,240
 isn't always connected to conviction.

129
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,000
 Sometimes he comforts us because we're broken hearted, or

130
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,240
 we've experienced loss, or we're lonely.

131
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:38,000
 Or sometimes he brings his comfort through us for somebody else.

132
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,920
 After one of the Sunday messages, I was having lunch across the road here in

133
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,880
 the little Malaysian place, cuz I love their rendang there, just a bit of a shout out.

134
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,040
 And I happened to be there by myself.

135
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,360
 Normally I'm having lunch with my family, but on this day I was by myself.

136
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,040
 And I'm just sitting there eating my lunch, and

137
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,760
 I'm getting ready about to stand up and go pay for my meal.

138
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,520
 And the Holy Spirit just said, you see that lady next to you?

139
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,720
 And I looked over, and I could tell it was one of our helpers.

140
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,200
 You know, like somebody who is a domestic worker working in Hong Kong,

141
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,040
 Sunday being their day off.

142
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,800
 She was sitting there relaxing, looking at her phone.

143
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,520
 Her bill for her dinner was just sitting on the table, and

144
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,440
 the Holy Spirit said, pay for her dinner.

145
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,880
 And I was like.

146
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,800
 The paying part wasn't the issue.

147
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
 The part was I didn't know this person.

148
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
 She was a stranger.

149
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,120
 And for a moment I really wrestled, cuz I thought I'm gonna be embarrassed,

150
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,840
 like talking to a complete stranger and saying, can I pay for your dinner?

151
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,040
 And I wrestled for quite a while.

152
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
 I sat there and I was like.

153
00:11:49,040 --> 00:12:00,040
 But eventually I gave in, I stood up, and as I passed this woman's table I said,

154
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,800
 is it all right if I pay for your meal today?

155
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,440
 She kind of looked at me like in shock.

156
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,880
 And I actually picked it up off the table and

157
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,760
 started walking towards the cashier.

158
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,800
 >> [LAUGH]

159
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,920
 >> And she sort of got up and

160
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,080
 started following me.

161
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,760
 >> [LAUGH]

162
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,640
 >> It's very awkward.

163
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,720
 And she said to me, but why, why, why?

164
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,280
 And I could have given her a whole Christian thing.

165
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,880
 I didn't.

166
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,920
 I just said, just because.

167
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,960
 Cuz I can.

168
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,120
 She said to me, can I give you a hug?

169
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,080
 The Holy Spirit was doing that not for my benefit.

170
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,320
 He was comforting her.

171
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,040
 He was bringing her to a place, even though she was giving me a hug,

172
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,280
 she was like the Holy Spirit was hugging her and letting her know that she was seen.

173
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:02,400
 So sometimes the Holy Spirit works his comfort through us if we're willing

174
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,240
 to listen, and not just listen but obey.

175
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,000
 Let's look at the convicting work of the Holy Spirit.

176
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,880
 Jesus said, the Holy Spirit will teach you all things and

177
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,600
 bring to your remembrance all the things I said to you.

178
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,720
 He will convict the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment.

179
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,960
 Let me give you an example of the convicting work of the Holy Spirit.

180
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,440
 When I was a teenager, my mom and dad made it clear

181
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,160
 that they did not want me dating until I was 16 years old.

182
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,080
 And they wanted me to choose someone who held similar Christian values.

183
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,120
 They would always tell me about that whole unevenly yoked thing.

184
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:57,040
 The oxen pulling the plow and how they'd put the harness over the shoulders.

185
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,320
 And if the oxen weren't the same height,

186
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,160
 one of the oxen would carry more of the load.

187
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,520
 And they would always tell me, if you go out with someone who doesn't share

188
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,160
 the same values, it's gonna be like that.

189
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,920
 There's gonna be times when you're gonna feel under pressure, and

190
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,480
 things are not gonna work out so well.

191
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,200
 Well, there were a number of times I broke these rules.

192
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,880
 In fact, my first boyfriend was when I was 11.

193
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,080
 >> [LAUGH]

194
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,560
 >> Nowhere near the 16 years of age.

195
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,320
 But you know, every time without fail, I would be convicted by the Holy Spirit.

196
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,880
 I remember once I was sitting in the back seat of a car holding a boy's hand, and

197
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,440
 my stomach was churning.

198
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,640
 I can remember literally feeling physically ill.

199
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:57,600
 And I could hear a very persistent voice in my head saying, this is not okay.

200
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,600
 This is not the right person for you.

201
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,040
 You need to end this.

202
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,920
 This didn't just happen once.

203
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,000
 I'm a slow learner.

204
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,880
 It happened many times.

205
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,000
 And I became aware at these moments that my parents were praying for me.

206
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,360
 And this is a good time to just encourage all the parents here.

207
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,720
 Do not stop praying for your children.

208
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,760
 The Holy Spirit is at work even when you are not around.

209
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:42,880
 You know I would experience no peace until I relented and

210
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,360
 I responded and I ended the relationship.

211
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,240
 Recently, I've been joking around with my teaching partner at school.

212
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,880
 And I made some comments about a staff member.

213
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,920
 The next morning driving to school, having a quiet time,

214
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,400
 the Holy Spirit convicted me of this conversation.

215
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:13,200
 He reminded me of who he was calling me to be, a person of encouragement.

216
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:19,640
 And he encouraged me to speak to my teaching partner when I got to school.

217
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,480
 To apologize to her and

218
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,360
 tell her that I shouldn't have been talking about this person behind her back.

219
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,120
 And that from now on I was going to endeavor to not do that again.

220
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,000
 The Holy Spirit reminds us of the person we are meant to be.

221
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,760
 He convicts us of sin and righteousness.

222
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,760
 He reminds us of the right way to live.

223
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,200
 As Andrew explained to us last week, the Holy Spirit has that great purpose

224
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,600
 of bringing something from disorder to order in our lives.

225
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,360
 And one of the key ways he does this is through his conviction.

226
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,320
 He helps us to recognize when we are not living

227
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,400
 as the person he's created us to be.

228
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,240
 When we believe in and accept Jesus as our savior,

229
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,040
 he covers us with his righteousness.

230
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,440
 He covers us with his goodness.

231
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,960
 The Holy Spirit holds us accountable.

232
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,840
 He reminds us that we are sons and daughters of God and

233
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,360
 we are called to reflect his light and goodness in the world.

234
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,920
 The conviction of the Holy Spirit only works, as I said before,

235
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,840
 if we listen and respond to it.

236
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,440
 You see, the more we hear and we don't respond,

237
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,920
 the duller the voice of the Holy Spirit gets.

238
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:04,640
 Eventually we'll reach a point where we won't hear at all.

239
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,520
 Ezekiel 12, 2 describes this.

240
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,600
 Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house,

241
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,800
 which has eyes to see but does not see.

242
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,120
 And ears to hear but does not hear.

243
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,960
 For they are a rebellious house.

244
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:34,360
 Many of us have stopped listening for many reasons.

245
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,800
 But mostly because we don't want to respond to what we hear.

246
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,240
 You see, it's easier making our own choices

247
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,400
 and living the way we want to live.

248
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,480
 But James warns us about what happens when we live like this.

249
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,880
 James 1, verses 23 to 24 says,

250
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,200
 "If anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer,

251
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,560
 "he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror.

252
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,040
 "For he observes himself, he goes away,

253
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,040
 "and he immediately forgets what kind of man he was."

254
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,800
 You see, when we stop listening to the Holy Spirit,

255
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,800
 we forget what kind of person we are meant to be.

256
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,520
 And we lose our true identity.

257
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:34,560
 Now we're going to speak about the comfort of the Holy Spirit.

258
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,040
 The Holy Spirit assists us.

259
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,000
 He counsels us.

260
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,480
 He guides us.

261
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,520
 He gives us the strength to move forward.

262
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,960
 He counsels us.

263
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,040
 He advocates for us.

264
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,320
 As I was preparing this sermon,

265
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,840
 I was reminded of this moment in my life.

266
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,680
 I was 17 and my boyfriend had just broken up with me.

267
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,360
 Seems to be a theme this morning,

268
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,400
 doesn't it, all my boyfriend stories?

269
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,840
 But this one, he had broken up with me

270
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,360
 and I had been going out with him for a year and a half.

271
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,600
 It wasn't just a month or something.

272
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,920
 And I sincerely thought that we would continue

273
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,320
 and eventually one day get married.

274
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,320
 I was sitting on my bed

275
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,000
 and I was experiencing inconsolable grief.

276
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,760
 And my father walked into the room.

277
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,080
 He sat down beside me on my bed.

278
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,120
 He put his arm around me and he said three words.

279
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,080
 It's his loss.

280
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,640
 I'll never forget that moment.

281
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,440
 The comfort and belief I received from those three words.

282
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,160
 It was like my dad restored my value.

283
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,760
 He helped me to see myself through his eyes.

284
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,480
 This is what the Holy Spirit does for us.

285
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,440
 The Holy Spirit restores our value

286
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,760
 and he helps us to see ourselves truly

287
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,320
 as we were created to be.

288
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,760
 Some of you here today,

289
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,920
 you are going through big and difficult things.

290
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,600
 20 years ago, my husband, Glenn and I,

291
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,320
 we moved to Darwin in Australia.

292
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,840
 Our friends had gone to pastor there

293
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,040
 and they asked us to join them.

294
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,560
 And at first we said, "No."

295
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,800
 If you know where Darwin is,

296
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,360
 it's like the Northwest tip up the top of Australia.

297
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,960
 It is isolated.

298
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,800
 You've either got to drive 24 hours to get somewhere

299
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,680
 or you fly.

300
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,280
 Like it is the back of beyond.

301
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,720
 And so when they said this,

302
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,200
 our pastor friend, Darren, he actually said,

303
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,240
 "I had a dream about you and you were in Darwin."

304
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,480
 And we were like, "No, no, no, no, no.

305
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,800
 That can't be right."

306
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,760
 However, we respected them enough to go and visit them.

307
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,160
 So we went and we visited.

308
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,120
 And while we were there, both my husband and I,

309
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,360
 I remember we were driving in the car

310
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,400
 heading out to one of the national parks.

311
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,960
 And I said, "Oh, what are you thinking?"

312
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,920
 And he said, "I think we're meant to be here."

313
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,600
 And I went, "Yeah, me too."

314
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,960
 So we packed up our four kids and we moved to Darwin.

315
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,080
 And we actually lived with Darren and Kim

316
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,640
 for a number of weeks

317
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,080
 because we were searching for a house to rent.

318
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,480
 And it took some time.

319
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,120
 And I remember we had meals with them.

320
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
 Darren loved to cook on the barbecue.

321
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
 So we'd sit outside beside their pool

322
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,720
 and we'd barbecue together and have meals.

323
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,680
 And it was a really beautiful time.

324
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,280
 We'd only been in Darwin six months.

325
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,400
 And our pastor, our friend, our mentor, Darren,

326
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,000
 was killed in a car crash.

327
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,320
 In fact, he had just been with my husband.

328
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,200
 Darren had visited him where my husband worked

329
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,680
 and they'd chatted.

330
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,480
 He'd given Glen a hug, hopped into his car,

331
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,520
 and about a kilometre away, he was hit by a big truck

332
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,320
 that just flattened the car.

333
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,360
 And I remember going to Kim's house that night

334
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,360
 and sitting on her bed.

335
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,080
 And we were just weeping together.

336
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,680
 And then she said,

337
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,200
 "God must have something pretty amazing planned

338
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
 "to come out of all of this."

339
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,880
 The gentle whispers and encouragement of the Holy Spirit,

340
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,360
 it didn't alter the heart-wrenching loss

341
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,840
 and it didn't change the circumstances.

342
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,800
 But I remember in the weeks and months that followed,

343
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:15,080
 months that should have been filled with chaos and despair,

344
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,120
 instead were filled with comfort.

345
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,960
 And we were given the strength and grace to lean in

346
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,120
 instead of lean away.

347
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,200
 We experienced, the church there experienced

348
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,480
 deep levels of comfort that held us and carried us.

349
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,960
 Andrew spoke last week of leaning into the person

350
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,760
 and the work of the Holy Spirit.

351
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,800
 In the last church-wide prayer and worship night

352
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,000
 that we held here,

353
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,960
 a word was given to us,

354
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,040
 a picture of what the Holy Spirit is doing amongst us.

355
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,600
 The picture was of a heart that had become hardened.

356
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,000
 It was encased in stone.

357
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,280
 But then the stone began to crack

358
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,000
 and it looked like eggshell.

359
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,960
 And then the work of the Holy Spirit came like water,

360
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,560
 coming and lifting the stone and washing it away.

361
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,760
 And as it did that, it revealed the red beating hearts

362
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,000
 of who we are truly meant to be,

363
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,320
 the fully alive version of ourselves.

364
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,840
 2 Corinthians 3:17 reminds us

365
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,080
 that where the spirit of the Lord is working,

366
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,360
 he brings freedom.

367
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:52,520
 Now we are going to get practical.

368
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,640
 And I know all the introverts are cringing,

369
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,400
 thinking, do I have to connect with someone?

370
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,080
 No, you don't, only the Holy Spirit.

371
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,960
 We are going to slow down

372
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,720
 and we are going to listen to the convicting voice

373
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,240
 of the Holy Spirit.

374
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,400
 You can use your phones,

375
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,400
 you can use your old school like me, your journal.

376
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,760
 You're going to write down whatever you hear

377
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,600
 and you're not going to overthink it.

378
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,160
 We have a great way of discounting

379
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,200
 the voice of the Holy Spirit.

380
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,320
 He speaks, we go, oh, that can't be the Holy Spirit.

381
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,720
 Whatever you hear, write it down.

382
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,640
 We are going to respond.

383
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,960
 So we're not only going to listen,

384
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,120
 but we're going to respond to what we hear.

385
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,120
 It's his kindness that leads us to repentance.

386
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,200
 You need to know that he comes,

387
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,080
 that his conviction comes with kindness.

388
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,400
 We're going to sit in what we hear

389
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,720
 and we're going to respond from our hearts.

390
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:18,200
 This isn't going to be about me,

391
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,120
 it's not going to be about any of the leadership here,

392
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,920
 this is a moment just for you

393
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,400
 and the Holy Spirit.

394
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,000
 Now maybe you're here today and you're not a Christian

395
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,360
 and you're thinking, well, this is going to be a waste

396
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,200
 of my time.

397
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,880
 Actually, you need to know that God

398
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,040
 has a real soft spot for you.

399
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,080
 In the Bible, there's a whole story

400
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,680
 where he leaves all the people who already know him

401
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,040
 and he goes and searches for the one that's lost.

402
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,120
 So actually this time is more for you

403
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,080
 than any other person in this room.

404
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,920
 You see, he's still speaking to you

405
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,520
 even if you don't know him yet.

406
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,360
 You can still hear him.

407
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,360
 So now we're going to take some time.

408
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,120
 Just you and the Holy Spirit.

409
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,920
 Imagine like my dad sitting beside me

410
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,760
 with his arm draped over me.

411
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,920
 That's how the Holy Spirit comes to us in gentleness.

412
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,120
 He sits beside us and he whispers

413
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,360
 and he reminds us of things that we need to hear,

414
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,360
 things we need to fix, things we need to let go of.

415
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:49,040
 So now, take this moment to listen.

416
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,480
 Don't just listen to him.

417
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,040
 Don't get distracted.

418
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,800
 If you're online, I hope that you are doing this

419
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
 with us as well.

420
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,920
 We invite you to join with us.

421
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,120
 Now we're going to take some time to sit

422
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,200
 in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.

423
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,880
 We're going to continue to listen to his gentle whispers

424
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,720
 and we're not going to rush.

425
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,720
 (gentle music)

426
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,360
 Once again, whatever you hear,

427
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,000
 you're going to write it down and you're going to sit.

428
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,800
 Just sit in his presence.

429
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,520
 Last night as I was sleeping,

430
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,360
 I was kind of in and out of sleep

431
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,240
 as I was thinking about today.

432
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,880
 I think my mind was worried about being prepared

433
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,240
 and through it all, I just heard the Holy Spirit say,

434
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,240
 "Susanna, my presence is not dependent

435
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,160
 "on your preparedness.

436
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:06,800
 "My presence is determined by your welcome."

437
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,960
 And I was thinking about that on the bus on the way in

438
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,960
 and I looked up the Hebrew word for welcome

439
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,280
 and it means to bless the one who comes.

440
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:30,480
 And I thought, whoa, so many times I look to be blessed,

441
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,280
 but how many times have I blessed the Holy Spirit

442
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,680
 by making room for him

443
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,520
 and blessing him with my time

444
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,240
 and blessing him with my attention

445
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,880
 and blessing him with my obedience.

446
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,720
 So today as we listen to his comfort,

447
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:02,480
 choose to welcome him, to make space.

448
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,880
 He's with you already, but he's a gentleman.

449
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,760
 He only goes as far as we allow him.

450
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,080
 So welcome him, make space.

451
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,240
 Let your ears be attentive to what he is speaking

452
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,520
 into your life right now.

453
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,480
 The worship team is gonna come,

454
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,440
 but we are not ending this.

455
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,160
 The Holy Spirit reminded me of a moment

456
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,320
 when I was a teenager and I was in a Christian conference

457
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,880
 for teenagers and the person who was preaching,

458
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,160
 I was standing at the altar call and he looked at me

459
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,960
 and he said, "The Holy Spirit is hovering over your life."

460
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,240
 And in that moment, I didn't fully understand

461
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,400
 what that meant, but I do now

462
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,200
 because the Holy Spirit across my life

463
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,200
 has been slowly bringing all the disorder into order,

464
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:32,480
 taking all the broken pieces and weaving his gold

465
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,520
 between those broken pieces and remaking this pot,

466
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:44,680
 giving me a beautiful story to tell.

467
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:51,640
 The Holy Spirit is hovering over all our lives.

468
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:59,000
 And this is not a moment just to be had and forgotten,

469
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,320
 but a moment to be carried into your everyday.

470
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,360
 You see, it doesn't matter if you're on a bus

471
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,360
 or driving a car or having a shower or washing the dishes,

472
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,000
 he's present with you.

473
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,720
 So welcome him and listen.

474
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,800
 He's working to make you

475
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:42,800
 the splitting image of Jesus.

476
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,880
 He's working to make you like Jesus.

477
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,720
 He's working to restore,

478
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:58,560
 but it only works if we listen and we obey.

479
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,560
 So make this a daily thing

480
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,560
 where you're stopping and you're listening

481
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,360
 and you're responding.

482
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,480
 He's your best friend,

483
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,080
 but he will also bring out the best in you.

484
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,680
 He will convict you and he will comfort you.

485
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,280
 (gentle music)

486
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:36,000
 Father, we just all come to you right now and

487
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,960
 we carry such brokenness sometimes, God,

488
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,880
 such disorder and chaos at times.

489
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:53,480
 Holy Spirit, teach us to slow down,

490
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,240
 teach us to remove distractions

491
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,960
 and do the one thing that's needed

492
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:07,320
 to sit with you in your presence and listen and respond.

493
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:15,720
 We commit ourselves to you and we ask

494
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,480
 that we will have the courage to respond to the things

495
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,440
 that you talk to us about today.

496
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,440
 Father, if you've challenged some of us to be more generous

497
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,040
 with our time or money, give us the courage to respond.

498
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,480
 If you've challenged us to restore a broken relationship

499
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,480
 with your help, give us the courage to love well.

500
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:48,040
 If you've encouraged us to let things go,

501
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,960
 whatever that may be, to make more space and room.

502
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,840
 If you've told us to say no to a relationship

503
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,240
 because it's not the right one for us, give us courage.

504
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,280
 Help us to walk these things out

505
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,880
 that you've spoken to us about today

506
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,560
 and rest in the comfort that comes when we do respond.

507
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
 We just thank you for loving us,

508
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:31,160
 walking with us and persisting with us.

509
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,000
 Thank you.

510
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,120
 Let's all stand, we're gonna worship together

511
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,440
 as we finish today.

512
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,040
 (gentle music)

513
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,720
 (bells chiming)

514
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,400
 (bells chiming)

515
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:56,400
