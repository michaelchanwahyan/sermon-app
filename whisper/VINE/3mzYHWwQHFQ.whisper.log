[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   And we pray all this in Jesus' name.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   Everyone says, amen, amen, awesome.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.900]   Have a seat, please, have a seat.
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.340]   Well, welcome to The Vine,
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.600]   if this is your relatively new time,
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.340]   or if this is kind of like one of your first times,
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.960]   we're so grateful you're here.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.320]   This is our 11 o'clock service.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.560]   We have three services on a Sunday, 9, 15, 11, and 2.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.760]   We're very, very, very full at the 11 o'clock.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.860]   In fact, we've got a huge overflow happening at the moment,
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.120]   and there's probably not a spare.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.420]   But if you do have a seat next to you,
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.260]   could you just put your hand up?
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.000]   There are some people standing around the sides here.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.180]   So if you do have a seat next to you,
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.920]   there's one right at the front over here,
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.680]   there's one in the back over here.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.840]   We really appreciate it.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.220]   And we don't want anyone having to stand,
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.400]   but we recognize that there's a bunch of people
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.800]   standing in the upper house and the lower house.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.640]   So if there's a possible seat next to you,
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.800]   or if somebody just doesn't mind sharing a seat,
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.520]   you know, bum on each part of the seat,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.200]   we're a community here together.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.120]   Okay, maybe don't do that.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.520]   No. (laughs)
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.760]   All right, Ellison's giving up his seat.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.160]   Come on, let's hear it for Ellison, what a man.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.000]   You can sit with Justin.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520]   Ellison's giving up his seat.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.560]   Okay, we need one person for this seat.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.520]   Otherwise, it's gonna look really weird in the video,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.640]   'cause there's gonna be like an empty seat right here.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.320]   Ellison, we need you back in that seat,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.600]   if no one else is gonna sit in that seat.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.940]   My name is Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.960]   We're grateful that you're here.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.440]   We've been in this series on the Holy Spirit
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.720]   over the last little while,
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.320]   and then this week and the next week,
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.960]   we're gonna be focusing now on the work of the Spirit.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.440]   And I'm really excited,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.600]   because we wanna do a couple of things with you today.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.120]   I wanna teach you a little bit around
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.520]   the work of the Spirit, which I'll do in a moment.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340]   But the most important thing that's gonna happen today
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.200]   is we're actually going to pray,
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.800]   and we're gonna make space for the work of the Spirit
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.360]   for each one of us here.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.300]   And that's gonna be personal, it'll be corporate,
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.000]   but we really wanna make space today.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.720]   So that's why we've set up a little bit differently.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.960]   That's why we're gonna have time.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.640]   That's why we cut our worship a little bit shorter
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.020]   than we normally do, 'cause we wanna emphasize
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.580]   the ministry of the Holy Spirit on each one of us today.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.060]   That's both Upper House, Lower House, in the overflow.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.220]   And if you're joining us online right now,
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.380]   we're so grateful you're sitting at home somewhere,
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.220]   wearing your pajamas maybe, just chilling out at home.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.540]   We're glad that you're here with us as well,
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.300]   and we pray that this and what we do today
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.220]   will also really reach you and minister to you
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.060]   where you're at.
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.100]   In order to kind of unpack what I wanna do with you guys,
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.100]   I wanna start by having you guys do something.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.780]   So I want you to start by thinking about
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.820]   when was the last time you experienced
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.740]   the personal work of the Holy Spirit for you?
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.460]   When was the last time you had a personal encounter
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.980]   with the Holy Spirit?
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.260]   For some of you, you're like, just two minutes ago
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.980]   during worship, which is great.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.840]   But maybe for many of us, maybe it's another time.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.320]   But have a think, when was the last time
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.820]   you had a personal encounter with the Holy Spirit,
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.660]   and what was it like?
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.820]   Think about that.
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.180]   Now, I would hazard a guess that for the majority of us
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.620]   in this room, when we pause for a moment to think about,
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.360]   okay, when was the last time I had a personal encounter
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.620]   with the Holy Spirit?
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.740]   The natural tendency is maybe to think about
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.680]   some of the dramatic kind of manifestations of the Spirit.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.940]   So we kind of automatically begin to think about,
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.100]   oh yeah, that time when somebody prayed for me
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.180]   and I felt like kind of bolts of lightning through my body,
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.380]   or somebody prayed for me and I felt all warm inside,
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.420]   or actually there was that moment when I was praying
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.140]   for somebody at the service last weekend,
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.380]   and I could see that the Holy Spirit was doing something
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.980]   on them and it just felt amazing.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.700]   Or maybe it was a time where you had a headache
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.140]   and you prayed and suddenly your headache went.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.420]   Or maybe you were with someone and they had something
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.900]   going on in their lives, and a group of people prayed
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.060]   for them and you saw a miracle take place.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.600]   I think when we often think about the work
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.060]   of the Holy Spirit, when we think about that
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.260]   as an encounter for us, it's easy for us to think about
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.220]   these dramatic moments where the Spirit does something
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.660]   external to us that is incredible to see,
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.220]   and those are, of course, very much the work of the Spirit.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.300]   But here's a fascinating thing.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.060]   When you open up the New Testament in particular
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.620]   and you look at the theology and the teaching
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.300]   around the Spirit, particularly in the work of Paul
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.980]   as he's writing to the church, predominantly what is spoken
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.500]   about when the work of the Spirit is spoken about
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.340]   is yes, it is the external manifestations.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.500]   I mean, we see those in the ministry of Jesus, of course,
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.980]   and the miracles in which he did.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.540]   And then in the early church, we know that there was gifts
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.780]   of the Spirit that was poured out, so of course,
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.540]   that external stuff was at work.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.760]   But Paul, predominantly, when he's speaking about
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.140]   the Spirit and its work, he talks differently.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.740]   He says, actually, the Spirit does its primary work
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.480]   within us, the slow at times, sometimes imperceptible
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.260]   changes that happen within us.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.580]   That the Spirit, by its fruit, comes and changes us
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.700]   and turns us into people who are more patient,
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.100]   people who have more joy, people that find more love
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.820]   coming from us.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.180]   And yes, there are the dramatic moments
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.300]   where the Spirit comes and does what only the Spirit
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.460]   can do, these miraculous things that I think,
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.020]   particularly for us charismatic Christians,
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.620]   that's kind of something that we long for and look for.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.620]   But actually, it's the internal, quiet, step-by-step,
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.140]   life-transforming work of the Spirit
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.700]   that the New Testament particularly celebrates.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.580]   In fact, it is these two things,
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.620]   and I want you to think about this.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.100]   It is the external manifestations of the Spirit
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.220]   and the internal transformation by the Spirit
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.580]   that are the totality of his work.
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.220]   Are you following this?
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.180]   Here's the tendency I think we have as Christians,
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.020]   is that when we see that the work of the Spirit
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.960]   is both of these things, the problem is, though,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.860]   if you're anything like me, you can have a bias
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.900]   towards one of them.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.060]   And that bias might be for a number of reasons.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.520]   There may be one of these sides,
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.060]   whether the external manifestation
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.980]   or the internal transformation,
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.220]   that we naturally find ourselves leaning more towards,
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.300]   wanting perhaps more or perhaps more comfortable with
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.300]   than the other.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.620]   Perhaps for some of you in this room,
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.620]   your theological convictions and your own personal
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.080]   convictions lends you to one or the other.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.100]   Maybe for some of us in this room,
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.960]   your past experience, whether good or bad,
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.640]   may actually put you in one camp or the other.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.620]   Maybe for some of you in this room, you just don't care.
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.940]   The exits are just over here and here.
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.660]   But whatever it is, I think we as human beings,
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.100]   we find ourselves gravitating towards one of these things
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.820]   more maybe because of theology,
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.100]   maybe because of experience,
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.820]   maybe because of our own convictions,
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.580]   but we're found in one of these things.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.980]   Here's what I've found.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.420]   I've found that this is seasonal in my life.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.620]   I wonder if you've ever found this.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.160]   I remember in my 20s, which was a while ago,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.040]   I remember in my 20s so passionate
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.000]   about the physical manifestations of the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.740]   man, I wanted to see miracles.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.840]   I wanted to see God do anything.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.520]   I wanted to lay hands on people
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.880]   that were texting their friends.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.720]   Hi, how are you?
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.640]   The Lord Jesus.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.480]   But I wanted to lay hands on people
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.560]   and pray for the Spirit, pray for miracles,
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.280]   see them set free, and I tell you what,
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.380]   in my 20s, I saw incredible things happen.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.300]   In my 30s, though, I went to Bible school.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.500]   And when I got to Bible school,
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.860]   it was almost like they did their very best
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.900]   to get rid of all of the manifestations of the Spirit,
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.080]   and it was all about the internal work
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.020]   of the sanctification of the Spirit.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.900]   And I studied scripture, and I learned about
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.060]   what the internal work of the Spirit does,
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.860]   and I remember in my 30s, I was much more focused
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.580]   for a season on the internal work
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.660]   and the sanctification power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.580]   In my 40s, I wanted both.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.280]   In my 40s, I was like everywhere.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.680]   You know, I want dramatic things, I want the internal.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.240]   In my 50s now, I can barely keep my eyes open, okay?
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.980]   But for me, it's been a seasonal thing.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.920]   I've found myself moving in seasons.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.440]   Perhaps that's the same for you.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.480]   Here's what I wanna say,
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.320]   and I think this is really important.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.160]   You know, here at The Vine,
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.840]   if you're new with us, welcome,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.360]   but here at The Vine, we've been talking about,
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.320]   over the last number of months,
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.280]   that we're in a season of uncharted waters.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.720]   What we mean by that is that the Lord
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.600]   is moving us as a church community
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.740]   out of our comfort zones into a place
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.000]   where we don't have a map or we don't have a strategy.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.680]   The Holy Spirit is beginning to do things amongst us
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.960]   that are taking us by surprise
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.400]   and causing us to kinda rethink
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.360]   how we do things together as a community.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.400]   It's an incredibly exciting time that we're in.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.560]   And because we are in an uncharted time,
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.960]   because we are feeling a little bit
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.160]   out of our comfort zones,
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.680]   here's what I think the Spirit wants you personally
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.400]   to lean into, to recognize which
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.360]   of these two sides you have a little bit more
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.880]   of a leaning towards, and then intentionally,
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.600]   in this time, try to work on the other side.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.680]   Try to open your heart to the other aspects
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.880]   of the work of the Spirit.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.200]   'Cause when we're in a season,
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.400]   when we're in uncharted waters,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.800]   when we're in a season where it's
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   a little bit uncomfortable,
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.040]   we're out of our comfort zone,
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.140]   you're gonna need both of these things
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.960]   at work in your life.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.040]   You're gonna need the stability of the Spirit of God
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.240]   working in these beautiful manifestations,
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.520]   working on the internal transformation
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.000]   that anchors you in a season
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.640]   where we're really relying on Him to lead us.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.520]   We don't have a map, we have a guide, amen?
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.960]   And the guide is the Holy Spirit walking with us.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.240]   And He wants to manifest His work in your life
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.500]   through the external and the internal.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.520]   So my challenge for us here this morning
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.040]   is to not treat these things like an and/or,
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.880]   but to treat them like both/and.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.920]   Now how do we do that?
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.060]   Well, I wanna do two things with us.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.080]   I wanna first of all, take us a little bit high up
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.240]   into a broad theological view of how Scripture
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.520]   provides for us a picture of the work of the Spirit.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.400]   And I wanna, if you will, not go into the depths
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.040]   of the details of it, but I wanna kind of do
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.660]   an airline kind of flyover of what Genesis to Revelation
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.920]   shares to us about the ongoing work of the Spirit.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.920]   And then from that place, I wanna then take it
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.840]   and make it more personal for you.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.760]   How the bigger picture, if you will, the broad narrative,
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.080]   actually then begins to speak to you personally
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.040]   in your context, and then after that, we're gonna pray.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.720]   And we are going to pray.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.940]   And we're gonna invite you to be brave,
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.920]   invite you to have some courage,
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.520]   invite you to wrestle with everything
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.260]   that I'm gonna be teaching and speaking about
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.200]   over the next number of minutes,
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.080]   and then come forward and have someone
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.980]   lay their hands on you.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.680]   And to see the manifestation and the internal work
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.040]   of the Spirit truly begin to take root in us, amen?
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.400]   Can I pray for us?
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.840]   Father, we are so grateful for each person here
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.160]   and for the way you have formed and shaped them.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.160]   We all recognize that we have our personal tastes,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.400]   our biases, the things that we naturally lean towards
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.560]   when it comes to your work of the Spirit.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.260]   Lord, I pray that as we open up the passages,
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.480]   as we look at the broader picture,
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.880]   Father, you would enable us to open our hearts
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.640]   and our minds to what else is there for us in this area.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.640]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.480]   Everyone says.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.720]   I wanna talk to you about the eight movements
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.840]   that the Spirit does through Scripture.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.000]   There are eight predominant times
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.080]   where the Spirit does something significant
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.480]   to say something about Himself and about His work.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.280]   And we're gonna look at those eight things
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.120]   as a way of fully understanding His work.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.760]   So, the first is found right at the beginning
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.800]   of the Bible in Genesis 1, verse two.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.960]   And we explained in the first week of our series here
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.000]   at the Vine on the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.400]   we talked about how the first time we're introduced
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.280]   to the Spirit is as a Spirit that's hovering over creation.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.760]   I'm gonna show you eight symbols
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.720]   to help illustrate these eight movements.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.620]   So, the first one, look at that, isn't that brilliant?
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.400]   The Spirit hovering over creation.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.640]   Now, what we see in Genesis 1, 2 is this perfect picture
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.200]   of the Spirit hovering over what the Bible describes
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.840]   as a formless void, a dark creation.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.440]   And we said in week one that what the Spirit is doing
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.720]   in hovering over it is having this desire
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.560]   to take something that is formless,
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.920]   bring it into form, and then move it to fullness.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.800]   This is the creative process that you see
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.000]   in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.680]   The Spirit, through the spoken word of God,
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.680]   takes things that are formless, gives them form,
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.520]   and then moves them towards their fullness,
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.120]   a place of shalom that God describes as very good.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.400]   And so what we see, the first thing we learn
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.880]   about the Holy Spirit hovering over a formless,
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.560]   dark kind of void, and then bringing it
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.080]   into this beautiful creation, is that the Spirit's intent
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.740]   always is to take disorder and bring it to order.
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.320]   The Spirit is at work in that.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.840]   We've been telling you a little bit about that
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.920]   over the last number of weeks,
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.700]   but that's the first movement of the Spirit.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.960]   Our introduction to the Spirit is one who takes things
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.920]   that are disordered and moves it to order.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.680]   And then we know what happens next, right?
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.480]   In Genesis 3, Adam and Eve decide to sin.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.320]   And in their rebellion against what God had called them
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.720]   to do, a division takes place.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.100]   They are actually, as part of that division,
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.280]   they are thrown out of the garden,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.120]   which really was a biblical way of saying
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.240]   out of God's presence.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.320]   So the Spirit was there, hovering over creation,
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.320]   taking things into its perfect order.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.440]   Then sin takes place with humanity,
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.720]   and suddenly a divide comes between humanity
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.960]   and the Spirit of God, from humanity and the triune Godhead.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.840]   And that division then basically becomes
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.960]   the movement of the rest of Scripture.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.680]   The rest of Scripture is humanity going,
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.760]   how do we get back to that relationship we had
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.560]   before sin was a reality?
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.480]   And this division and the casting out of humanity
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.160]   from the presence of God becomes humanity's big focus.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.700]   This is why, in Genesis 11, they build a tower
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.480]   to try to get back up to that presence.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.700]   They think if they can just get back up to the heavens
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.920]   somewhere, then they can reconcile that Spirit
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.240]   and that presence, but that's not how God is going to do it.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.880]   In fact, God comes and He breaks down that tower,
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.640]   and He basically says, we're gonna do this a different way.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.600]   The next movement, therefore, of the Spirit that we see
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.260]   takes place in Exodus chapter three.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:13.260]   Moses, walking around, suddenly sees a burning bush.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.740]   The Spirit suddenly manifested beautifully
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.160]   in this burning bush, and Moses goes over to it,
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   and we know what happens, right?
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.000]   As he goes over to the burning bush,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.120]   God calls out from the bush and says,
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.920]   Moses, Moses, don't come any further forward,
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.240]   for the ground that you're standing on is what?
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.880]   Holy ground, holy ground.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.000]   Not that Moses was holy, not that the ground
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.840]   was some special kind of ground that was sacred and holy.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.120]   No, it was the presence of God, the Spirit of God
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.680]   revealed once more towards humanity
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.880]   that became this holy space.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.620]   And when God says, take off your sandals
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.240]   and step onto this holy ground,
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.120]   what He's saying is, I wanna fill the flesh, Moses,
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.280]   I wanna fill your flesh with my Spirit.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.320]   There's gonna be a communing again
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.040]   that was like what it was in the garden before.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.640]   We wanna commune now together,
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.400]   because God is beginning to change
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.280]   and draw humanity back to Himself.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.600]   So the starting point is that the Spirit
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.980]   is disordered, the order.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.840]   The next thing is that He is holy.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.200]   And that holiness, the holiness of God,
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.680]   and the holiness of His Spirit
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.400]   becomes the way that humanity understands
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.460]   its separation from the Spirit.
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.680]   The next movement is that God then appears
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.480]   by His Spirit on a mountain, Mount Sinai,
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.560]   also a part of the Exodus narrative.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.800]   And up on the mountain, something very special takes place.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.900]   On the mountain, the law is given, the law is poured out.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.040]   That's the Old Testament.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.680]   First of all, the 10 laws, the 10 commandments,
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.520]   then eventually the Levitical law,
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.440]   all poured out through the power of the presence
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.000]   of the Spirit on a mountain, and only one person, Moses,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.520]   is able to go up into that presence
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.480]   and see God face to face.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.080]   So this one person goes up, sees God face to face,
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.920]   the law is given, and the law,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.160]   this is the best way to understand it,
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.760]   the law is birthed by the Spirit
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.800]   to explain to us the character of God.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.260]   Often when we think of the 10 commandments,
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.040]   we think the 10 commandments are basically
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.100]   a bunch of rules to make us live a boring life, right?
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.680]   Like a bunch of rules that we have to kind of adhere to
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.360]   or check up on a list just to make ourselves feel better
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.080]   or to think that we're gonna be
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.400]   in some better relationship with God,
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.400]   but actually that's not what the law was about.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.720]   See, the law was actually about kind of communicating
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.560]   to humanity who God is.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.280]   So when God says, "You will have no other God before me,"
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.940]   he's explaining his character of loyalty and steadfastness.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.880]   When he says, "You will not commit murder,"
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.840]   what he's saying about himself is, "I am a God of life.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.520]   "I am a God of giving, not a God of taking."
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.260]   So each of the laws represents some character of God
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.700]   that God is explaining, and it's the Spirit
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.400]   that births the character of God.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.280]   Are you with us still so far?
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.360]   Is this okay?
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.680]   Okay, hang with me, hang with me.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.760]   Here's the fourth one.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.360]   Then God instructs him to take the tablets
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.280]   and place them in a box,
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.860]   quite literally the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.160]   Now, this is funny because so often as Christians
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.140]   we're trying to get the Spirit out of a box,
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.600]   but here at this moment, God puts the Spirit in a box.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.080]   Now why does he do this?
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.020]   It's because he wants the Spirit to be with his people.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.960]   But because of sin, there still needs to be a barrier
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.580]   between God and his holiness and God's people.
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.680]   So he's placed within this box,
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.720]   and his presence now goes forward with his people.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.240]   And because his presence is with his people,
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.480]   their character is there, the people are created
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.800]   and made holy, not because they were perfectly holy
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.260]   themselves, but because God's presence was amongst them.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.040]   But it's in a box because there are boundaries.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.020]   And if anybody was to open that box,
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.120]   if anyone was to carry that box in the wrong way,
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.680]   if anybody was to do something,
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.940]   then they would be kind of completely punished
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.320]   because that box was a sacred thing
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.480]   carrying the presence of God,
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.640]   and there was boundaries still between humanity
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.740]   and his presence.
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.620]   But he had drawn nearer, you following?
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.000]   This becomes even more so when you see the next movement.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.040]   The box then gets placed eventually into the temple.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.140]   So David, Solomon, with the vision that they have
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.200]   for the temple and the construction of the temple,
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.880]   then the box placed in the heart of the temple itself.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.920]   And as it's placed in there, it's placed in this place
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.560]   called the Holy of Holies.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.400]   And the Holy of Holies was like the inner sanctum
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.160]   of where the spirit of God was,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.920]   where the Ten Commandments and the Ark of the Covenant sat.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.880]   And in the Holy of Holies, it was separated,
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.040]   again, from the people, with a large, thick curtain.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.960]   And once again, only one person could go
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.240]   into the presence of God.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.860]   And this was the priest once a year
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.400]   who had completely purified himself for that journey
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.940]   to go into God's presence.
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.240]   So there again, God's presence is with his people,
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.920]   but there's a boundary still that separates
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.960]   the holiness of God and his people themselves.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.760]   As God's people are taken into exile because of their sin,
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.600]   and Assyria and Babylon come and do that
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.840]   and bring them into exile, the temple,
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.760]   the first temple is destroyed.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.140]   And when the temple is destroyed,
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.280]   here's what happens to Israel.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.640]   They're wondering about the spirit,
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.680]   and they say, where is the spirit?
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.920]   Where has the spirit gone?
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.400]   Because of our brokenness and our sin, we're now in exile.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.580]   The temple's been destroyed.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.840]   God's presence has left us.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.320]   And when 70 years later, they're actually released back,
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.300]   and Zerubbabel brings a group of them back
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.340]   to start to rebuild the temple,
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.000]   they want to rebuild the temple.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.780]   They create the Holy of Holies again.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.300]   The presence of God again falls amongst this curtain,
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.380]   but there's a change in the thinking of Israel
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.460]   at this point.
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.620]   And they think, look, every single time we try
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.460]   to restore our relationship with the presence
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.880]   and the spirit of God, it doesn't seem to work.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.380]   Perhaps only God can do that work.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.300]   And so at this period, although they rebuild the temple,
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.880]   and God's presence comes back,
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.660]   their thinking is slightly different.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.180]   They're like, God will need to step in in the future
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.300]   if ever humanity and the spirit
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.120]   will ever reconcile together again.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.360]   And then comes Jesus.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.220]   Jesus, as we know, is the Messiah, the incarnation,
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.420]   fully God and fully human.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.260]   And here's what I want you to think about that.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.260]   This is the fullness now of the spirit in a human person.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.540]   The incarnation is this beautiful idea
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.560]   that the spirit is no longer in a bush,
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.000]   it's no longer in a mountain, it's no longer in a box,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.720]   it's no longer in a temple, it's now come in a person.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.600]   And it's come in the fullness of a person
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.460]   so that the spirit and humanity are now this picture
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.760]   of reconciliation.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.360]   But note, it's still just one person.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.400]   And Jesus, in living out the fullness of the spirit
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.260]   within him, does the amazing external manifestations
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.920]   that we see, commands nature, walks on water,
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.260]   does the things, heals people, multiplies food,
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.220]   does crazy stuff through the power of the spirit.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.140]   And as he begins to walk out the kingdom,
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.300]   he begins to demonstrate what that kingdom
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.300]   could actually look like when the fullness of the spirit
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.020]   and humanity come together.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.400]   That's the beauty of the incarnation.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.440]   But it's still just one person.
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.840]   On the death and resurrection, everything changes.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.080]   And Jesus, in taking on the weight and the burden of sin
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.580]   onto his shoulders, for the wages of sin is death.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.600]   As he takes that into death and is raised again
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.720]   to new life on the third day, sin now has been dealt with.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.380]   The very thing that had separated the spirit
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.280]   from humanity now dealt with.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.900]   This is why, actually, he turns to the disciples
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.920]   in his resurrection and says, don't go anywhere,
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.320]   wait, because I'm about to send you the thing
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.840]   that you truly need.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.140]   He's like, I need to actually go from here
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.320]   so that you will receive the fullness of this thing
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.280]   that I'm about to send to you.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.480]   And so he does, he sends them the Holy Spirit,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.080]   Acts chapter two, and they begin to manifest the beauty
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.280]   of the gospel through human languages.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.760]   And many people in Jerusalem at that time
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.380]   begin to turn and hear the gospel together
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.600]   for the first time.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.760]   It is this beautiful idea that the spirit now
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.260]   begins to get poured out on people,
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.600]   fulfilling the prophecy of Joel that would say,
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.740]   in those days, the spirit would come upon all flesh,
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.800]   fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah, who would say,
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.880]   there is a time coming where the spirit of the Lord
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.280]   will be upon me so I can preach good news to the poor.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.040]   And these things all begin to come together
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.440]   as the disciples themselves experience the fullness
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.760]   of the spirit within them, and they realize
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.440]   that there's no longer any separation anymore.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.880]   This is why Paul, then, when he's writing to the church,
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.960]   he writes this most profound theological idea.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.560]   No one in history had ever said this before.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.960]   He says, don't you realize that you are now
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.460]   the temple of the Holy Spirit?
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.680]   He's like, it's not a building anymore.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.500]   Oh, back in the old times, we needed the separation
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.620]   because we could not enter the holiness of God
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.420]   without sin having been dealt with,
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.400]   but now sin has been dealt with, so don't you realize
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.120]   that the spirit is now happy to make his home within you?
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.800]   Happy to come and have that fullness of the spirit
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.240]   and the fullness of humanity, no longer just
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.720]   in the incarnation of Christ, but in the church itself,
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.880]   which is why I love this symbol.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.280]   See all the people with the spirit inside of them there?
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.480]   They look like bowling pins.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.220]   They're not bowling pins.
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.880]   Those are people filled with the spirit,
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.560]   which is why, then, Paul writes to the church,
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.360]   and he says, don't you know that the same spirit
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.120]   that raised Jesus from the dead is now inside of you?
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.160]   He then writes and says, no one is able to say
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.280]   Jesus is Lord unless the spirit enables them to say it.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.800]   He's like, the spirit now, there's no barrier,
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.160]   there's no brokenness, there's no separation.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.640]   We are now all filled with the spirit of God,
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.920]   and yes, it's the external manifestations,
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.900]   and we give grace for that, but it's also
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.600]   the internal transformation that is at work.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.440]   I can see the spirit, and I can confess the spirit
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.800]   because of the spirit.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.000]   So that's how scripture would describe the movement,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.400]   the eight primary movements of the spirit,
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.440]   all to communicate that now the fullness
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.880]   of that spirit is here with us.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.920]   Now, that's a very quick overview,
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.640]   but let me give you two important things of it.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.000]   The first is, I want you to see through all of this
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   that there is a trajectory of the spirit
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.120]   desiring to get closer and closer to you.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.280]   Are you with me?
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.200]   So from the start, it's like, okay,
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.720]   just hovering over everything,
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.520]   but then the narrative of scripture,
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.200]   if you follow it from Genesis to Revelation,
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.880]   is the spirit basically pursuing you.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.880]   The spirit getting closer and closer and closer and closer,
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.880]   and when Jesus does the death and the resurrection,
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.440]   pays the price for sin, then within us,
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.500]   the spirit is constantly on your pursuit.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.360]   And this is a beautiful thing,
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.300]   because what the scriptures really kind of teach us
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.360]   about the spirit is that it's for our good.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.400]   It's for our benefit to connect us with Jesus,
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.040]   who connects us to the Father.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.640]   And the spirit manifests the person
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.440]   and the character of Jesus,
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.840]   which is what the spirit has always done
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.420]   with the law that was given on Mount Sinai.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.960]   Then in Pentecost, we're celebrating next week,
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.600]   the law is now written on the tablets of our heart
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.080]   and poured out by the spirit.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.920]   In other words, the character of God
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.940]   is now not just written on some stone tablets,
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.180]   it's actually written within me.
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.960]   But I get to see and feel that spirit at work now within me,
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.280]   and it is a profound thing.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.240]   The brokenness of Andrew
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.260]   and the fullness of the spirit as one.
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:29.440]   And the reason why that's important
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.040]   is 'cause when you think about it that way,
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.560]   the spirit is always to connect you to Jesus,
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.960]   it's always to connect you to the Father,
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.640]   it's always for your good.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.720]   Which is really interesting,
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.440]   because I've struggled many times in my Christian life
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.160]   with fear when it comes to the spirit.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.040]   Anyone else ever felt that way?
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.900]   A little bit fearful of the spirit?
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.360]   I know I have, I've had season where I'm like,
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.720]   I'm not sure if I wanna pray
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.200]   and invite the spirit to come more
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.720]   'cause I don't wanna bark like a dog.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.560]   Right?
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.960]   Like I don't wanna do a weird thing.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.560]   I've seen at times the spirit do weird things to people
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.600]   and I don't wanna be doing weird things,
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.640]   that's embarrassing.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.500]   So I've held myself back
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.040]   from the fullness of the spirit at times out of fear.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.760]   I wonder if that resonates with anyone here.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.280]   But when the scriptures teach us
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.160]   that the spirit is always pursuing us,
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.120]   when the scriptures teach us
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.840]   that the spirit is leading us to Jesus,
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.040]   when we know that everything the spirit has for us
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.400]   is for our good,
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.840]   Paul's like, why wouldn't we welcome it?
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.000]   Why wouldn't we eagerly desire the spiritual gifts?
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.200]   Why wouldn't we want the spirit to fall on us
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.160]   and be a part of us?
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.640]   And if you're struggling here today
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.480]   with any sense of fear around the Holy Spirit,
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.280]   I can't wait to be able to pray with you in a moment.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.160]   'Cause I believe that the Lord
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.480]   wants to do something significant
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.200]   by breaking off the fear
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.120]   that I think we can so easily hold.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.460]   The reality is the fear around the Holy Spirit
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.400]   is a strategy of the enemy.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.460]   And as we stand together as a community
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.400]   and break off that stronghold
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.960]   that can easily be upon us,
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.440]   I believe we will be freer
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.880]   for the external manifestations
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.120]   and the internal transformation
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.160]   that the spirit wants to bring.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.540]   Is that okay?
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.380]   Okay, that's the first thing.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.320]   Here's the second thing.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.960]   I want you to come have a look at this.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.080]   'Cause I wanna explain now,
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.560]   before we go into prayer,
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.160]   exactly what all of this is saying to us
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.120]   about the work of the Spirit in fullness.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.160]   Now, I'm gonna do the work of the Spirit
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.120]   in like a little spirit bubble like that,
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.640]   but we actually know that it's a person, right?
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.720]   The Spirit is a person.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.880]   We've talked about that in this series so far.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.720]   But I wanna explain to you
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.320]   what we see in this whole eight movements of the Spirit
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.800]   and how it begins to show us
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.080]   something quite significant
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   that's taking place in the world.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.240]   Okay, so there are actually two,
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.660]   that now looks like a tree, by the way,
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.760]   but it's not a tree, okay?
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.340]   Just bear with me.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.200]   So what we see is that the Spirit is in the world.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.920]   The Scriptures, in that overview I gave us,
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.840]   would teach us that the Spirit is actually in the world.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.400]   In fact, the way it's described in Genesis as the ruach,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.400]   it's a Hebrew word which means breath or wind.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.000]   The idea that the Spirit is the breath
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.240]   that brings all of creation alive.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.960]   In fact, it is the sustainer of all life.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:13.600]   So the Spirit sustains and brings to life everything,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.080]   holds everything in its heart,
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.560]   holds everything in its ability to be able to breathe,
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.560]   have its function and have its being.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.360]   The Spirit is in the world
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.800]   so that everything might find life.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.920]   Paul would later write in Romans chapter eight,
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.800]   Romans eight, this idea of like,
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.640]   hey, there's creation itself
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.880]   and it's groaning and longing for its own reconciliation,
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.160]   its own redemption with the Lord.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.040]   There's this longing in it.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.880]   And we see that the biggest picture of this is,
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.600]   as I've already explained, the incarnation,
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.080]   the power that there is in humanity and the Spirit
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.520]   now in the world together,
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.040]   manifested in that beautiful way of the external
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.240]   and the internal that is at work.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.400]   So the Scriptures teach us that the Spirit is in the world.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.600]   Does that make sense?
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.920]   But the Scriptures also show us
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.960]   that the Spirit is upon the world.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   This is slightly different
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.040]   and it's important to understand the differences.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.920]   So the Spirit in the world, the breath sustaining all life,
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.120]   the incarnation and its greatest expression,
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.200]   but the Spirit is also upon the world.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.400]   We saw that with the hovering element.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:23.080]   We see that in the prophetic words of Joel and Isaiah,
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.480]   where they long for, as Joel would say,
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:29.120]   that the Spirit in those days will be poured out upon
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.520]   all flesh, the idea that the Spirit moves upon.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.920]   But this is seen most dramatically
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.840]   actually in the death and resurrection moment
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.640]   where the curtain, I can't spell,
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.000]   where the curtain in the temple
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.520]   is split from top to bottom.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.960]   So in the moment where Jesus gives up his life,
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.120]   the curtain splits from top to bottom.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.040]   Now the question we should ask is
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.120]   why does the curtain split from top to bottom?
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.360]   It splits, yes, so that humanity is now symbolically
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.880]   invited in to the presence of God,
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.960]   but the split is also there to illustrate
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.600]   that this presence now can come out into the world.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.760]   So there is an in towards the Spirit
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.560]   by the cutting of the curtain,
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.920]   but there also is a releasing of the Spirit
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.280]   into the world through the beauty of that as well.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.240]   This is really important because if you believe
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.120]   that the Spirit is upon the world
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.440]   and you believe that the Spirit is in the world,
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.200]   that means that when you wake up tomorrow
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.520]   and you go into your workplace,
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.560]   the Spirit is as much there as it is here right now.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.840]   Are you following this?
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.520]   Like this is theologically really important
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.280]   so that when you get up and go to work tomorrow,
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   you have the same expectations.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.440]   It may not be worship music, it may be a board meeting,
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.200]   it may be a classroom, it may be whatever it is for you,
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.200]   but you can also think that the Spirit
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.960]   is as much at work in this place
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.280]   as he was yesterday at the Vine.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.640]   And I think God wants to, in this time of uncharted,
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.040]   make sure that we're expectant in the community
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.380]   as much as we are in this community, okay?
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.880]   Only me who is excited about that.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.720]   Okay, great.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.640]   Now, this is where I'm gonna finish, notice this.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.920]   The same of what the Spirit has done in the world,
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.200]   he has also done in us.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.720]   The Spirit is also in you.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.560]   You can look at it later, but in 1 Corinthians 12, 3,
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.400]   in 1 Corinthians 6, 19, Paul basically says the same thing,
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.880]   that we are able to say that Jesus is Lord
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.040]   because of the work of the Spirit in us.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.960]   So the Spirit is in you to bring you to salvation,
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:39.760]   first and foremost, and then Paul says it is sanctification,
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.600]   the ongoing work of the Spirit to make us more and more
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.600]   like his son Christ Jesus, and that is Ephesians 4.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.320]   Now, in this process of sanctification,
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.720]   he gives us what's called the fruits of the Spirit,
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.400]   the Spirit that actually bears fruit inside of us,
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.960]   Galatians 5, 22, and Ellison is gonna preach
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.140]   and teach more on that fruit of the Spirit next week.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.040]   So the Spirit is in you for salvation and sanctification.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.320]   Helpful?
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.960]   But the Spirit is also at times upon you,
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:20.920]   and the Spirit comes upon you for various different things.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.840]   This is seen predominantly, again,
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.240]   you can look at 1 Corinthians 12, 1 Corinthians 14,
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:30.200]   where it speaks ideally around the ideas of the gifts,
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.760]   the gifts of the Spirit and how the gifts of the Spirit
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.160]   are at work in us, upon us, using us.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.240]   Now, the important thing is that the upon you work
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.100]   of the Spirit is to essentially do this thing.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.540]   It's to empower you.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:48.600]   So where the Spirit is in you for salvation
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.600]   and sanctification, the Spirit comes upon you to empower you.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.160]   And the question is why and what is it empowering?
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.120]   Well, the Bible would suggest two areas.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.280]   First of all, kingdom advancement.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.600]   This is what we see in the life of Jesus.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.680]   It's what we see in the life of the church.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.760]   The Spirit pours out upon His people,
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.600]   and prophetic words come.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.060]   Prophetic words that help people to understand who God is.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.920]   Prophetic words that maybe changes something
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.240]   in someone's life.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.480]   A word of knowledge that actually changes
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.800]   somebody's life dramatically.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.160]   Jesus' miracles performed to inaugurate the kingdom.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.220]   The church now embracing the miraculous
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:32.020]   to show the world signs of the kingdom that is here.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.440]   The kingdom advancement empowered by the Spirit
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.120]   that is upon us.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.940]   But then also, it speaks about the idea of victory over sin.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:45.600]   Now, of course, in Jesus' death and resurrection,
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.040]   sin is defeated.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.040]   But I think we all know that sometimes sin
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.760]   has a stronghold in us.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.320]   Sometimes sin can become habitual for us,
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.000]   and as much as we might try to fight it,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   we realize that there's a weakness to us.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.700]   The Spirit comes upon us at times to bring us
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.500]   greater victory over sin,
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.480]   particularly where there's strongholds
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.840]   or there's habitual sin that we've not been able
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.680]   to break at any point in time.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:15.000]   So the Spirit is in you, and the Spirit is upon you.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.080]   Is that helpful?
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.320]   All right, five of you, good.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.340]   Now, notice this.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.640]   Here's what we actually do.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.740]   We put all of these things into boxes,
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:28.880]   and we find our preferences.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.780]   And so for some of you, like I said earlier,
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.340]   you're fully comfortable in this space right here,
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.900]   but this idea kind of freaks you out a little bit.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.300]   Or maybe you're very comfortable in this space
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.900]   'cause that's how you were brought up.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.460]   Maybe you've been in a church environment
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.660]   where that's really clear,
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.660]   but this whole sort of fruit of the Spirit
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.500]   sanctification thing, you're not quite sure about that.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.540]   Maybe, again, you don't believe that God can be
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:53.400]   as powerful in your workplace as He is for 90 minutes
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.020]   at the vine on a Sunday.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.180]   We can all have our boxes,
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.440]   and what I'm trying to say to us today
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.020]   is that if we're really gonna embrace
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.200]   the work of the Spirit, it needs to be
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.520]   in all of these areas in our world and in our lives,
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.740]   in the world, upon the world, in you, upon you.
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.200]   Helpful?
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.300]   All right, so that was like the intro.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.600]   I'm freaking you out now.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.320]   This is the main course, okay?
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.160]   Because I've just unpacked a bunch of theological stuff
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.560]   for you, which is helpful and interesting, I hope,
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:33.700]   but the reality is God does all of this
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.940]   so that He can transform and change us,
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.940]   culture, society, the world.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.560]   The good news of Jesus Christ is not that a church
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.520]   changes anything, but Jesus changes it.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.660]   The good news of Jesus Christ is not that a person
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.120]   can heal another person, but that the Spirit of God
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.480]   can heal someone.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.960]   The good news of Jesus Christ is that it all is about Him,
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.640]   and He does all of this, not so,
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.760]   and we said this the other week,
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:03.120]   not so He can show off, but so that He can act.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.780]   So He can take us from a place of brokenness
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.300]   to greater freedom, so that He can take us
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.160]   from a place of darkness to a place of light,
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.400]   where He can take the disorder in us
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.440]   and bring it into order, and that's what we want to do now.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.220]   We've got 25 minutes, can you believe it?
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.000]   I hope you're excited.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.720]   I'm excited.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.960]   We're gonna have a prayer team in the upper house.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.640]   We're gonna have a prayer team here in the lower house.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.920]   We're gonna have some people at the front.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.160]   There's gonna be some people here.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.560]   There's gonna be some people around here,
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.120]   and here's what we're gonna do.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.580]   If you, no one's gonna be forced to do anything,
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:42.900]   but if you would like to receive prayer,
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.480]   maybe for you it's like, you know what?
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.140]   I've got too much fear.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.840]   I've got too much fear, and it's holding me back
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.120]   from this box right here, and I would love someone
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.560]   to pray for me and to release that fear.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.840]   Or maybe you're looking for more of the fruit
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.640]   to be at work in your life, and you'd like someone
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.360]   to stand for you and pray for the fruit to manifest.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.680]   Maybe you want more expectation for your workplace,
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.640]   and you want someone to come around you and stand with you.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.360]   Maybe there's some habitual sin that's going on,
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.520]   and you're like, you know what?
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.160]   I've ignored it for too long.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.160]   I've tried to battle it in my own strength.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.840]   I've built my own Tower of Babel.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.080]   Nothing is working.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.620]   I need the Spirit to break me free.
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:19.960]   I'd love to do that.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.360]   We would love to do that with you today.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.400]   So whatever it might mean for you,
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.320]   how is it that you would like to receive prayer?
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.160]   And this is what we're gonna do.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.240]   We're just gonna enable a time of prayer.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.520]   There's gonna be some worship happening,
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.580]   so if you're not being prayed for,
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.920]   if you just wanna worship, maybe reflect
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.260]   on what we've taught today, invite the Spirit
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.800]   to be with you in worship.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.000]   If you'd like to come forward for prayer in a moment,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.240]   we're gonna do that for you as well.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.000]   So why don't we all stand together?
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.480]   And I'm just gonna invite our pastors and prayer leaders
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.920]   and elders just to be available,
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.820]   whether that's to come to the front here
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.880]   or just on the sides in the upper house
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.240]   at the front and the back.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.840]   I wonder whether we just all open our hands
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.760]   if you're comfortable to do so.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.920]   And I'm gonna pray, and then we're gonna invite you
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.760]   to respond.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.820]   Father, we are standing before you as your people,
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.040]   and we're so grateful that we're at the part
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.600]   of the biblical story where the Spirit is at work in us,
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.680]   where the Spirit, because of Christ's death
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.500]   and resurrection, is fully here for us.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.560]   And Father, we stand here at the vine
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.280]   on the first Sunday of June, 2025,
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:37.820]   and we say, come Holy Spirit, come Holy Spirit,
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.320]   come Holy Spirit.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.080]   We pray you would break fear in the name of Jesus.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:49.080]   We pray you would bring healings in the name of Jesus.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.680]   We pray that the miraculous would be manifested here
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.320]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.440]   We pray for sanctification, salvation,
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.240]   the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.440]   We pray for our workplaces.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.900]   We pray for the places of influence you've given us.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.560]   We pray that the Spirit would be in and upon the world,
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.420]   in and upon us, and we pray this fervently.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.000]   So I encourage you to be brave.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.220]   If you'd like to receive prayer,
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.000]   you can just make your way out and come forward,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.400]   both in the upper house, again, here in the overflow,
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.360]   you can come on into the room as well,
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.640]   and we're just gonna take time to pray
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.720]   for each one of you personally.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.240]   So anybody who'd like to receive personal prayer,
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.500]   please come forward.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.340]   Okay.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.920]   (gentle music)
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.500]   (gentle music)
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.080]   (gentle music)
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.660]   (gentle music)
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.240]   (gentle music)
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.820]   (gentle music)
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.400]   (gentle music)
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.400]   [MUSIC]
