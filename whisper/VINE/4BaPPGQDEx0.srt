1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
 The Father says to you this morning,

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,700
 "You are my child whom I love.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,100
 "With you I'm well pleased.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,640
 "You are my child whom I love.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,100
 "With you I am so pleased."

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,300
 I feel like for some of us in this room,

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,500
 there's a counter thought,

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,820
 perhaps a counter narrative

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,520
 that the enemy has placed upon you.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,380
 You're not worthy to be a child of God.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,380
 Have you looked at your life lately?

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,900
 Have you looked at your choices?

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,940
 Have you looked at your sin?

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,580
 He doesn't want you.

15
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,700
 He doesn't wanna be around you.

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,700
 You're not deserving of his forgiveness.

17
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,300
 You're a terrible person, unworthy of love.

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,000
 I wanna come against that alternative narrative now

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,740
 in the name of Jesus.

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,700
 I wanna pour the blood of Jesus over anyone in this room

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,580
 who is coming today with a narrative

22
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,820
 that is not from the Lord, but from the enemy.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,860
 And while sin might be a reality for us,

24
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,020
 we are never cut off from a restored relationship with Christ

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,580
 through the forgiveness of sin.

26
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,500
 Your own worthiness is never enough

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,620
 to bring you into the presence of Jesus.

28
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,420
 He chooses to step into your presence.

29
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,660
 He chooses through the blood of Jesus shed on the cross

30
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,980
 and the resurrection of Christ for you.

31
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,700
 He chooses to step into your world

32
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,580
 and meet you in your brokenness, in your hurt,

33
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,340
 and in your harm, and in all the alternative narratives

34
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,420
 that are spoken over you.

35
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,960
 And he says, because of the blood of Jesus, you are worthy.

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,460
 I love you.

37
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,860
 You are my child whom I love.

38
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,020
 With you I am well pleased and may never a word

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,620
 or never a voice say anything other to you.

40
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,780
 You are my child.

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,060
 You're mine, my beloved.

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,320
 Father, I pray for the freedom that comes.

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,080
 Through the wonder of the grace of Christ Jesus

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,160
 and the indwelling person of the Holy Spirit.

45
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,560
 And Father, as we open up your word here today,

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,680
 I wanna pray that love for anyone

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,080
 who's got those alternative narratives

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,320
 around their minds and their hearts,

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,760
 that as we open scripture today,

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,200
 as we unpack the beauty of the Spirit of the Lord,

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,560
 I wanna pray for that greater freedom.

52
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,960
 I believe some of you in this room are gonna be released

53
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,600
 over the next 30 minutes or so.

54
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,320
 Honestly, release.

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,680
 (congregation applauding)

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,120
 Some of you in this room, it's been years,

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,520
 years of habitual brokenness in a certain area of your life.

58
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,240
 We believe Exodus is the primary work of the Spirit of God.

59
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,640
 And we pray for freedom like never before.

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,920
 And we pray this in Jesus.

61
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,880
 Everyone says.

62
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,320
 (congregation applauding)

63
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,880
 Amen, amen.

64
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,840
 Have a seat, have a seat.

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,920
 So right at the beginning of this year,

66
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,520
 in the very first devotional that we sent you

67
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,120
 as part of the fast that we did

68
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,560
 right at the start of this year,

69
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,800
 I said in that devotional,

70
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,240
 I wrote one of my dreams for this year.

71
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,440
 And I said one of my primary dreams for this year

72
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,800
 is that the Vine would experience an even greater

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,480
 manifestation and ministry of the Holy Spirit.

74
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,240
 And this has become something that we're longing for.

75
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,360
 And as a leadership, we've been praying for deeply

76
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,760
 here at the Vine is that each one of us

77
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,520
 would experience a greater measure this year

78
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,280
 of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.

79
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,760
 If you look throughout history,

80
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,080
 at ever the time when God calls a community of people,

81
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,800
 a church or a group of people

82
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,040
 into a time of uncharted waters,

83
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,680
 which is what we've been saying God is doing

84
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,320
 here at the Vine in 2025,

85
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,440
 when he calls people into uncharted waters,

86
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,240
 what he's specifically doing is he's taking us

87
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,880
 out of our comfort zones.

88
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,200
 He's placing us in a scenario and a situation

89
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,720
 where we have no roadmap, no strategy,

90
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,160
 no ability to be able to predict what's gonna happen.

91
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,880
 It's literally uncharted waters.

92
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,520
 In that environment throughout history,

93
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,200
 whenever God does that in his people,

94
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,960
 he always brings, and there is always a need

95
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,160
 for a heightened sensitivity to the work

96
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,120
 and the power of the Holy Spirit.

97
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,800
 Because when we're in a place of out of our comfort zone,

98
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,880
 we're no longer relying on our own strength.

99
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,360
 We realize that we cannot, just like that word,

100
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,400
 breathe in me 'cause I can't take breath

101
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,480
 unless you're involved.

102
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,320
 We realize I cannot sort this out,

103
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
 I can't navigate the future

104
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,680
 unless your spirit reveals itself.

105
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,440
 And so in these seasons, it is a season to lean in

106
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,920
 to the work and the ministry of the Holy Spirit

107
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,960
 like never before.

108
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,160
 And one of my great joys, if I look back

109
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,080
 over all the Sundays that have happened

110
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,160
 over the last beginning of this year to now,

111
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,400
 I can testify that we've been seeing this.

112
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,440
 We've been seeing this increase of the ministry

113
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,400
 of the Holy Spirit amongst us.

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,080
 And it's been profoundly beautiful in these gatherings,

115
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,440
 but actually what the Holy Spirit is doing amongst us

116
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,360
 is even greater outside of what's just taking place

117
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
 in these 90 minutes on a Sunday.

118
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,880
 We've been hearing testimonies of so many of you

119
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,680
 in your own individual journey with the Spirit

120
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
 and what the Holy Spirit is doing for you personally.

121
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,520
 We've been hearing about marriages

122
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,360
 that have been transformed.

123
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,080
 We've been hearing about broken relationships

124
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,200
 within families getting reconciled.

125
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,000
 We've seen physical healings take place this year

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
 as people have prayed for people

127
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
 and they've received an immediate physical healing

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 for something that was ailing them.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
 And perhaps most profound of all,

130
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,520
 and always the most profound work

131
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,800
 that the Holy Spirit ever does,

132
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,560
 last Sunday, where we were celebrating

133
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,800
 the death and resurrection of Jesus,

134
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,680
 we baptized 28 people down in Repulse Bay

135
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,080
 into the waters of baptism,

136
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,640
 coming out of the waters of baptism into new life.

137
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,360
 The most significant work of the Holy Spirit

138
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960
 to bring people into a renewed relationship with Jesus.

139
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,880
 Amen.

140
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,280
 And I believe that what we're seeing

141
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,080
 and what the Spirit is doing is just the tip of the iceberg.

142
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,040
 It's just the first fruits of what He wants us

143
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,400
 to lean into for the rest of the year.

144
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,520
 And I believe that there's gonna be an increase each week,

145
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,920
 an increase amongst us corporately,

146
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,280
 an increase amongst us individually

147
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,560
 of the manifest ministry of the Holy Spirit in our church.

148
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,560
 And I'm so glad that I'm the only person excited about that.

149
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,680
 (congregation laughing)

150
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
 Come on, church.

151
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,680
 (congregation applauding)

152
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,800
 I honestly believe this.

153
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,640
 Let me say this.

154
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,600
 I honestly believe this.

155
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,640
 I believe that the greatest manifestations

156
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,040
 of the Holy Spirit on earth are not behind us,

157
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,080
 they're ahead of us.

158
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,240
 (laughing)

159
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,440
 Now, I'm not just saying that for claps, okay?

160
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,080
 I genuinely, honestly believe that.

161
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,960
 And here's why.

162
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,240
 I think as Christians, we can have this funny thing.

163
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,680
 As Christians, we can kind of open the page of the Bible

164
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,120
 and we can see the work the Spirit does in Scripture.

165
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,840
 And we can see what happens in the life

166
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,400
 of the ministry of Jesus.

167
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,880
 And we see all these incredible things.

168
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,720
 And it's almost like our primary posture

169
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,640
 with the Holy Spirit is one of nostalgia.

170
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,960
 It's like, wow, look at that.

171
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,520
 Oh, I wish I had been there in the first century.

172
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,360
 I wish I had been there

173
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,480
 when the Spirit was so at work in the world.

174
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,680
 Like, I wish I had been there

175
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,160
 when Jesus and Peter walked on water.

176
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,640
 I wish I had been there when Jesus raised the child

177
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,720
 from death to life in the village of Nain.

178
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,880
 I wish I had been there when handkerchiefs

179
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,760
 were just in the presence of Paul

180
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,280
 and they were taken and laid on sick people

181
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,200
 and they got well.

182
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,840
 Man, if only I could have ever been in the time

183
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,360
 where the Spirit is at work.

184
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,760
 And we can have this posture, right,

185
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,400
 with the Holy Spirit of nostalgia.

186
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,280
 Like that the greatest moments of the manifestation

187
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,480
 of the Spirit on earth are in the rear view mirror.

188
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,840
 That they've kind of happened in some time in the past.

189
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,520
 Let me just break that myth with you right up front here.

190
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,880
 The scriptures do not teach that the greatest moments

191
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,320
 of the Spirit are behind us.

192
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,240
 In fact, Paul, writing to the church,

193
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,200
 trying to help them to build an expectation

194
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,760
 of what God's gonna do in their midst, he writes this.

195
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,600
 He says the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead.

196
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,080
 Just pause there.

197
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,120
 The greatest moments ever of the Holy Spirit

198
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,040
 at work in this world is the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

199
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,360
 Because that's the moment where sin is defeated

200
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,760
 and reconciled relationship with God comes.

201
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,760
 Never been a greater moment of the work of the Spirit

202
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,240
 in the world than the moment of the resurrection of Jesus.

203
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,640
 And Paul says to the church, that same Spirit

204
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,420
 that did the greatest thing that none of us

205
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,920
 could ever achieve, he goes, that Spirit now lives in you.

206
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,200
 He's like almost saying to the church,

207
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,320
 like get your head around this.

208
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
 Like before Jesus' death on the cross,

209
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,600
 the Spirit was at work in the world.

210
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,120
 The Spirit was externally manifesting itself beautifully

211
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,920
 in the moment of the cross and the resurrection.

212
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,560
 He says, but it's no longer just out there in the world.

213
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,840
 He said, now that Spirit lives in you.

214
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,240
 It's like Paul is saying, don't you realize

215
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,080
 that everything changes now, that the indwelling power

216
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,240
 that raised Jesus from the dead can now raise you

217
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,520
 from the things that are dead in your life,

218
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,320
 from the things that are broken in you

219
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,040
 can now be manifested new life.

220
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,600
 The things that you've never welcomed,

221
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,760
 the sovereignty of the Lord can change in an instant

222
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,080
 'cause he raised a man from dead to life.

223
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,640
 Imagine what he can do in your soul.

224
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,120
 Imagine what he could do in your heart,

225
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,080
 he's saying to his church.

226
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,840
 He's like, raise your expectation.

227
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,080
 Jesus taught the same thing, didn't he?

228
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,640
 When he promises the Holy Spirit to the disciples

229
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,720
 in his resurrection, he says these beautiful things.

230
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,240
 He says, you're gonna be able to do

231
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,720
 even greater things than I did.

232
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,440
 This is not a theology that the best is in the past.

233
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
 This is a theology of expectation in the church

234
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,840
 to begin to lean forward in the hope and the belief

235
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,800
 and the expectation that God is gonna do

236
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,640
 even greater things.

237
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,120
 And so I wanna say this right over you here this morning.

238
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,520
 The greatest work of the Holy Spirit

239
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,400
 is not in your rear view mirror.

240
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,400
 Some of you in this room, that's what you feel.

241
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,520
 You're like, man, I don't know if I would ever get back

242
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,800
 to that relationship I had with Jesus five years ago.

243
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,000
 Some of you are like, man, I don't know

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,560
 if God's ever gonna manifest himself

245
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,520
 like I remember in my youth.

246
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,680
 Let me say this to you.

247
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,120
 The greatest relationship with the Holy Spirit

248
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,080
 is ahead of you, not behind you.

249
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,720
 Oh my God, I'm so excited.

250
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,520
 Now this is the reason, this is the reason

251
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,720
 why we're doing a seven-part series on the Holy Spirit

252
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,960
 starting today over the next seven weeks

253
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,600
 because I think it's so easy for us

254
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,760
 in a season of uncharted where we need to rely more

255
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,280
 on the Holy Spirit, it's so easy for us

256
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,680
 to have just one way of thinking about the Holy Spirit,

257
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,920
 like boxed in, if you will, to a certain way

258
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,080
 that we've always thought about the Holy Spirit

259
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,160
 and kind of summarize or think that all of the Spirit's work

260
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,960
 is just this one thing that we understand

261
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,200
 when actually the Scriptures provide

262
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
 a very broad perspective on what the Holy Spirit does

263
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,040
 in this world.

264
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,800
 And the reality is we can get so wrapped up

265
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,160
 in just the one thing because that's perhaps

266
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,240
 the one thing we've experienced.

267
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,000
 When it comes to the Spirit of God in our lives,

268
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,320
 we're so experiential as Christians.

269
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,560
 And maybe the Holy Spirit's manifested itself

270
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,400
 in a certain way in your life in the past

271
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,360
 and that's become the primary way

272
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,760
 that you think of the Spirit and that's blinding you,

273
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,840
 perhaps, to some of the other ways the Spirit works

274
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,720
 that God wants you actually to be awoken to

275
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,200
 so that you can see the totality

276
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,600
 of what the Spirit is doing in your life.

277
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,640
 Does that make sense?

278
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,040
 But we're so logged in, I think,

279
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,200
 to how we've come to experience Him in the past.

280
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,520
 I remember the first time I encountered the Holy Spirit.

281
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,600
 I was four years old.

282
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,880
 My parents at the time were involved

283
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,080
 in a very charismatic church in the south of England,

284
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,920
 like super charismatic, the kind of church

285
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,560
 where you walk in and you're like, what is going on?

286
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,400
 And on this particular day, my father responds

287
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,600
 to the word that was preached towards the end

288
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,640
 of the service and he responds and he goes forward

289
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,120
 for prayer and I remember as a four year old

290
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,560
 seeing the pastor and the pastor leans forward

291
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,160
 and just gently places his hand on my father's forehead.

292
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,920
 My father starts to shake and then he collapses

293
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,880
 and he's as still as possible on the ground.

294
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,880
 Now as a four year old, here's how I interpreted

295
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,640
 that moment, the pastor has killed my father.

296
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,080
 [audience laughing]

297
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,560
 Like that's what I thought, the pastor has killed my father.

298
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,240
 I start screaming and crying and like I'm throwing

299
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,320
 attention 'cause I think my father's dead.

300
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,120
 My mom, here's this kid screaming, she runs over,

301
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,920
 she sees it's her son, she picks me up in her arms,

302
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,440
 she's like, what's going on, Andrew, what's going on?

303
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,920
 I'm like, the pastor's killed my father!

304
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,440
 And here's what she says, she says, oh no, no, no, no,

305
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,000
 no, no, no, dad's not dead, your father's not dead,

306
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,200
 no, no, no, God's just speaking to him.

307
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,240
 And here's what I thought as a four year old.

308
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,880
 If that's how God speaks to people, I hope he never

309
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,680
 speaks to me for the rest of my life.

310
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,760
 [audience laughing]

311
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,960
 You know what I'm saying?

312
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,200
 But these dramatic moments of the Holy Spirit

313
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
 become so central and in that moment shapes so much

314
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,600
 of my theology, my thinking about the Holy Spirit

315
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,360
 and we can so hang on to the dramatic things

316
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,720
 that we see in the Spirit or read about in the Spirit

317
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,880
 or maybe have experienced ourselves and we actually

318
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,920
 don't allow ourselves to understand that the Spirit

319
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,760
 is so much more than just the magnificent and the dramatic

320
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,720
 that so often the work of the Spirit is imperceptible.

321
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,640
 So often the work of the Spirit is actually happening

322
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,960
 within rather than externally.

323
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,640
 So often the Spirit is doing more at chipping away

324
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,080
 my character and the things that are broken within me

325
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,360
 than perhaps he is miraculously healing somebody

326
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,720
 all of a sudden.

327
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,040
 And yet we can get so caught up that we think,

328
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,280
 oh man, I wish it was back like the day of Acts

329
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,800
 because we're looking for the dramatic all the time

330
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,160
 when God is like, don't you realize that my Spirit

331
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,160
 is doing more on earth today than it's ever done before?

332
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,560
 Don't you realize that people are changing

333
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,560
 and being transformed and being renewed like never before?

334
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,480
 And so I wanted to just say that this has been my journey.

335
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,400
 Like I have experienced the dramatic in my life.

336
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,200
 I remember a time when I was in the Philippines

337
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,960
 and a 14-year-old girl from our youth group

338
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,200
 prayed for this blind guy and he received sight

339
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,960
 right then and there before my own eyes, nuts.

340
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,160
 I remember a time when my wife had a pain

341
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,480
 in the side of her rib cage and she'd had that pain

342
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,280
 for a long time and we were praying about it

343
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,040
 and I saw a picture of like a dagger

344
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,280
 in the side of her rib cage and I didn't know what to do

345
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,720
 and Chris was like, well just pull the dagger out.

346
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,560
 And I'm like, weird, okay.

347
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,320
 And I just kind of like went to the place

348
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,680
 where I thought the dagger was, pulled it out

349
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,880
 and she was miraculously healed,

350
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,040
 never had that pain ever again.

351
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,720
 I remember a time where I was, this is crazy,

352
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,200
 where I spoke in another human language,

353
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,440
 one that I did not know because of the anointing

354
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,280
 of the Holy Spirit.

355
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,440
 Crazy story, I'll save that for another week.

356
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,200
 I've experienced these dramatic experiences

357
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,560
 with the Holy Spirit but let me tell you this,

358
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,520
 after 30 years of being a Christian

359
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
 and 30 years of a relationship with the Holy Spirit,

360
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,980
 here's what's the most dramatic that has happened to me,

361
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,080
 the things that you perhaps would never know.

362
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,120
 The fact that I can stand before you now 30 years later

363
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,360
 and say I'm more patient than I've ever been.

364
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,280
 The fact that I know that I have more self-control

365
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,280
 over my temptations today than I did when I was in my 20s.

366
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,800
 The fact that I can recognize that I've actually

367
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,160
 been strengthened in a way within me

368
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
 that I can withstand some of the criticism

369
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,360
 and feedback and stuff that happens

370
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,800
 when you have a public role like this

371
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,440
 in a reasonably large church in a big city.

372
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
 Like I know that there's things that the Spirit

373
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,080
 has done in me that is far greater

374
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,320
 than some of those manifestations that we said.

375
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,640
 Not that they're bad and here's the point.

376
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,200
 So often in our understanding of the Spirit,

377
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,920
 we choose one or the other.

378
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,000
 Like we're either like, we're charismatic

379
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,360
 and everything's great and we wanna see the miracles

380
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,280
 and pray for a Bible or we're not sure

381
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,160
 if that happens anymore.

382
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,600
 We're people who like to study the Bible.

383
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,240
 Right, and we have these dichotomies

384
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,360
 between like it's either this or it's that.

385
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,700
 Here's what the Scripture teaches.

386
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,880
 It's not a choice between either or, it's a both and.

387
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,400
 That we are ones who should long for and see

388
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,220
 and experience the dramatic ways

389
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,480
 that the Spirit is at work in us,

390
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,880
 but we should also be expecting and leaning into

391
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,860
 those quiet, imperceptible changes of our character

392
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,600
 that happens within.

393
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,240
 And it's this both and that we wanna teach you

394
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,000
 over the next seven weeks.

395
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,280
 We wanna help you to wrestle with the reality

396
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,520
 that the Spirit is presented to us

397
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,060
 in a complex way in Scripture.

398
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,800
 For example, He works in a community,

399
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,360
 but He also works individually.

400
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,680
 Or maybe this, He brings comfort and peace to us,

401
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
 yet He also convicts and challenges us,

402
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,840
 which isn't very comfortable.

403
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,440
 Or like He opens the Scriptures to us

404
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,960
 so we can understand God's Word

405
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,240
 from 2,000 something years ago,

406
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,280
 but He also speaks a rema fresh Word

407
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,200
 that's relevant to the day.

408
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,480
 And this both and reality of Scripture

409
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,320
 is what we wanna open up to you over these seven weeks

410
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,180
 so that you, as you're in this season of unchartedness,

411
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,200
 can find yourself with a greater expectation

412
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,220
 of what the Spirit is about to do for us as a church,

413
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,320
 but also for you personally.

414
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,840
 Is that helpful?

415
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,640
 And I wanna start that process today

416
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
 by teaching you a bit.

417
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,320
 Oftentimes when I'm up here at front,

418
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,640
 I like to preach to you and tell funny stories

419
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
 and yada, yada, yada.

420
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,520
 Today I wanna teach.

421
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,800
 I wanna unpack a couple of really deep biblical things,

422
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,680
 theological things that I think will help you

423
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,040
 as we begin this process of journeying more

424
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,520
 with the Holy Spirit.

425
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,000
 And I wanna debunk a couple of myths about the Holy Spirit.

426
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,860
 And then I want to give you the primary purpose

427
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,280
 of what the Spirit of God is doing on earth,

428
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,240
 why it is that we have the Spirit of God.

429
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,640
 And because that primary purpose

430
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,320
 is what all the other both ands

431
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,240
 that we're gonna unpack throughout this series,

432
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,200
 they fit under.

433
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,720
 They serve the reality of this bigger thing

434
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,200
 that I wanna unpack for you today.

435
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,520
 Does that sound all right?

436
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,940
 All right, so let me debunk

437
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,080
 one of the most important myths straight away.

438
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,440
 The primary way that Scripture speaks about the Spirit

439
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,240
 is as a person, co-eternal and co-existent

440
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,080
 with the Father and the Son.

441
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,280
 That's the primary way that the Scriptures speak

442
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,240
 about the Holy Spirit, as a person,

443
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,580
 which is deeply challenging,

444
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,800
 because if you're anything like me,

445
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,720
 I think we Christians really struggle with this,

446
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,000
 'cause I think we can very easily have a concept

447
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,400
 that the Holy Spirit is largely like a life force

448
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,140
 or like some energy out there in the world.

449
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,280
 Star Wars has ruined it for all of us, okay?

450
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,840
 And we think that the Holy Spirit

451
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,400
 is a bit like the force in Star Wars.

452
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,840
 These are not the droids that you are looking for.

453
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,680
 Do you know what I mean?

454
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,560
 Like we can tap into some sort of life force

455
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,440
 or energy in the world to get superpowers,

456
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,080
 to do things that we couldn't do as normal humans,

457
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,520
 and that the energy and the life force,

458
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,120
 the Spirit is flowing out there somewhere,

459
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,480
 and we need to tap into it, access it for ourselves.

460
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,760
 Making sense?

461
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,800
 Now, the reason why we do this as Christians

462
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,320
 is because the Bible doesn't really help us

463
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,540
 with this sometimes, 'cause the Bible presents the Spirit

464
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,680
 in these kinds of ways at times.

465
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,560
 The metaphors of like wind and breath and fire and cloud

466
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,260
 and tongues of fire, all of these things describing

467
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,680
 who the person of the Holy Spirit is,

468
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,000
 and yet described in a language that kind of at times

469
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,960
 sort of strengthens our thought

470
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,320
 that the Holy Spirit is a force or energy in the world.

471
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,600
 But the most important thing you need to do

472
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,920
 right at the beginning of this series

473
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,780
 is to understand that actually the Holy Spirit

474
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,840
 is not floating out there, some esoteric kind of thing

475
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,520
 that's like an energy to tap into.

476
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,300
 The Holy Spirit is a person.

477
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,040
 And this is very important because when you begin

478
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,320
 to understand the Spirit of God as a person,

479
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,220
 it actually revolutionized how you actually come

480
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,640
 into relationship with the Holy Spirit,

481
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,600
 how you treat the Holy Spirit,

482
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,020
 how you expect the Holy Spirit to work in your life.

483
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,040
 If He's just some life force,

484
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,200
 you're constantly trying to tap into it.

485
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,360
 If He's a person, you should be submitting to it.

486
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,200
 Come on, church.

487
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,360
 Now, Paul, who's perhaps one of the great writers

488
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,000
 of the Spirit in the New Testament,

489
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,840
 Paul's theology of the Spirit is phenomenal.

490
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,640
 I just pulled out, I went through the scriptures this week,

491
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,960
 and just pulled out a bunch of the ways

492
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,400
 in which Paul speaks of the Spirit,

493
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,640
 and how the Spirit, what the Spirit does.

494
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,000
 So let me just show you this kind of slide here.

495
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,200
 He counsels us to know the mind of Christ,

496
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,640
 strengthens us in our weaknesses, intercedes on our behalf,

497
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,880
 teaches the gospel to us, leads us in the ways of God,

498
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
 grieved by our sinfulness,

499
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,040
 bearing witness with our own spirit.

500
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,260
 Take a look at this.

501
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,760
 These are not the things that you would describe

502
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
 to some life energy.

503
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,360
 These are the things you would describe

504
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,680
 to someone who's a person, who's able to teach,

505
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,720
 able to pray, able to have emotions,

506
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,040
 able to stand with us, grieving alongside of us.

507
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,320
 I mean, this is a person.

508
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,840
 This is describing the Spirit as a person.

509
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,400
 Does that make sense to you?

510
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,440
 Which is even more important when you begin

511
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,560
 to think of how Jesus predicted the coming

512
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,680
 of the promise of the Holy Spirit.

513
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,080
 Jesus in John 16, seven, He put it this way.

514
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,480
 Let me read this to you.

515
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,840
 He says, "I tell you the truth.

516
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,520
 "It is better for you that I go,

517
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,240
 "for if I do not go, the advocate, the Holy Spirit,

518
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,280
 "will not come to you.

519
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,240
 "But if I go, I will send him to you."

520
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,000
 Notice how Jesus describes the Holy Spirit as a person.

521
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,360
 He doesn't say, "I will send it to you."

522
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,720
 He doesn't say, "Tap into this flow of the universe

523
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,240
 "and you'll be great."

524
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,560
 He's not trying to teach some new age philosophy here.

525
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,280
 He's saying, "No, a person is going to come to you."

526
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
 Now, here, debunk myth number two.

527
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,040
 He describes Him here, which makes us think,

528
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,160
 okay, well then maybe the Spirit is like a masculine thing,

529
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,400
 but actually the Spirit is not got a gendered body.

530
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,720
 Does that make sense to you?

531
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,720
 So the Spirit itself encompasses all of human life.

532
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
 So it is both masculine and feminine.

533
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,400
 It holds both of those things in its fullness.

534
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,200
 So though Jesus uses a word here

535
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,040
 that probably just helped people to understand

536
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,400
 that a person is coming,

537
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,000
 I don't want you to get embedded into thinking

538
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
 that the Spirit is mostly masculine.

539
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,840
 Does that make sense?

540
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,120
 So there's this idea that Jesus says,

541
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,760
 look, it's right for you to have this experience

542
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,720
 with the person Spirit.

543
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,680
 He doesn't just say that.

544
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,600
 Notice what he says here.

545
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,440
 He says, "It's better for you."

546
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,400
 Get your head around this.

547
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,240
 He says, "It's better for you that I leave you

548
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,520
 "and send you the Holy Spirit."

549
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,800
 For Jesus, it was better for us

550
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,960
 to not have him in his bodily form,

551
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,640
 but to have the indwelling of the Spirit within us.

552
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,000
 I don't know about you,

553
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,720
 but that doesn't sound like a good deal.

554
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,040
 Like, wouldn't you rather have,

555
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,880
 like, imagine if Jesus was standing in his bodily form

556
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,040
 right here, right next to me, right now in Hong Kong.

557
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,120
 Revival would break out.

558
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,800
 Would you not think so?

559
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,480
 But Jesus says, "It's actually better.

560
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,760
 "It's actually better that I go

561
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,080
 "and that you experience the fullness

562
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,640
 "of what it's like to have one of the Godhead

563
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,960
 "living, dwelling inside of you,

564
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,640
 "turning your world inside out,

565
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,960
 "filling you with love and grace and power

566
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,320
 "and healing and mercy."

567
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,120
 Oh, he's saying, "It's so much better.

568
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,280
 "I am here in my human form.

569
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,200
 "I can only be here with you in this moment,

570
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,000
 "but when I go, one is gonna come

571
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,600
 "who's gonna be in all of you,

572
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,040
 "because greater are the things that you're going to do

573
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,040
 "and the spirit that is in you is the same spirit

574
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,400
 "that's gonna raise me from the dead," he says.

575
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,200
 Now, this is wonderful, and it's important

576
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,680
 that we shift our thinking away

577
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,240
 from the Star Wars force of the spirit

578
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,760
 to the person of the spirit for this primary reason.

579
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,080
 When you think of the Holy Spirit as a person,

580
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,920
 your immediate thought now is,

581
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,040
 how do I have a better relationship with this one?

582
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,480
 Person means communal relationship.

583
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,520
 Spirit means tap into something out there.

584
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,000
 Are you following this?

585
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,480
 Now, this is why when Paul writes to the church

586
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,720
 about the Trinity in one of the most beautiful times

587
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,720
 he does it in 2 Corinthians in 13, verse 14, he says this.

588
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
 He says, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ

589
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,200
 "and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit

590
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,640
 "be with you all."

591
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,600
 Isn't that a beautiful prayer for his church?

592
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,400
 But notice, he chooses one word to describe

593
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,680
 each member of the Trinity,

594
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,800
 and it's almost like Paul is going,

595
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,400
 "Okay, what's the best way I can describe each member?"

596
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,840
 He says, "Oh yeah, it's the grace of Jesus Christ."

597
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,080
 Well, of course.

598
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
 Grace is the perfect way to describe Jesus

599
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,280
 because it's his grace that we are saved

600
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,360
 by what he did on the cross, the forgiveness of our sin.

601
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
 He then says, "Well, it's love for the Father."

602
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,040
 Well, that makes sense 'cause the Father so loved the world

603
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,600
 that he sent his only son.

604
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,880
 When it comes to the spirit,

605
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,560
 notice the word he uses, fellowship.

606
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,040
 Like, he doesn't say like tap into, access,

607
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,960
 or just us to be filled with this kind of emotional feeling.

608
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,720
 No, he said, "I want you to have the Greek word koinonia,

609
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,600
 "communion, togetherness with the person of the Holy Spirit."

610
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,400
 Our fellowship, our relational connection

611
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,120
 comes to the person of the Holy Spirit.

612
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,320
 As that spirit is at work within us,

613
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,720
 we build that relationship with him,

614
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,080
 and this koinonia flows out of us towards one another.

615
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,600
 When he's saying the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,

616
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,440
 what he's actually saying is

617
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
 you have personal fellowship with him,

618
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,360
 but then you have communal fellowship with one another

619
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,240
 through the spirit, and you might have different backgrounds,

620
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,240
 different life stories, different cultures.

621
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,440
 You might have different traumas.

622
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,760
 You might be wrestling with different things.

623
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,400
 None of that matters because the spirit of God

624
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,800
 unifies us into togetherness.

625
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,560
 The relationship we have with God

626
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,280
 through the person of the Holy Spirit changes everything.

627
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:04,560
 Now, let me just summarize why this is an important shift

628
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,240
 in the way that we think, 'cause a lot of it comes down

629
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,680
 to how we're going to approach the Holy Spirit.

630
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,200
 So let me show you this slide here.

631
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,720
 On the left-hand side are the ways in which we would react

632
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,760
 if the spirit is predominantly a force

633
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,640
 or an energy to tap into.

634
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,080
 Our question then is how can I access the spirit more

635
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,000
 so I can use it?

636
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,360
 I don't know about you, but I can put my hand up

637
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,640
 and say I've thought about the spirit that way a lot

638
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,480
 in my Christian life.

639
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,240
 How do I access more of the spirit so I can use it?

640
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,840
 A better way of thinking about it

641
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,640
 when he's the person of the Holy Spirit,

642
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,240
 how can I get to know the Holy Spirit more

643
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,400
 so he can use me?

644
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,880
 Are you following this?

645
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,240
 It's a completely different way of being with the spirit.

646
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,480
 One is like I need to tap in to gain

647
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,400
 the other is I wanna know so that I can become

648
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,120
 the best version of myself that I can be.

649
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,560
 I wanna have a relationship so that everything can change.

650
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,840
 Or let me show you another one.

651
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,400
 So here's another one.

652
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,960
 How can I get a hold of the spirit more?

653
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,280
 Like I've gotta try to get a hold of the spirit

654
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,560
 or I've gotta ask to kind of receive more and more

655
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,000
 like we wanna kind of ask the spirit of God

656
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,440
 to do something for us.

657
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,400
 Notice on the other side when he's more of a person,

658
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,520
 how can the spirit get a hold of me more?

659
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,680
 What a profoundly different approach that is.

660
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,120
 Do you see why it's so important to shift our mindset

661
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,360
 about how we conceive of the Holy Spirit

662
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,680
 from this force and this energy towards a person, right?

663
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,520
 'Cause when he's a person, our primary posture,

664
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,600
 notice this, when he's not a person,

665
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,600
 our primary posture is control and access and use.

666
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,400
 Doesn't sound very godly, does it?

667
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,320
 But when we see him as a person,

668
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,000
 our primary posture is what we were praying earlier,

669
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,440
 submission, humility, worship.

670
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,480
 And so as we begin this shift

671
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,920
 in the way we think about the Holy Spirit,

672
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,960
 we begin a huge shift in how we encounter

673
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,320
 and how we submit and how we open our lives

674
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,680
 to the work of the spirit around us.

675
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,880
 Not a give me, give me, give me,

676
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,040
 but a make me, make me, make me.

677
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,800
 Now, are you tracking with us so far?

678
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,520
 Let me try that one more time.

679
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,320
 Are you tracking with us so far?

680
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,200
 Okay, I wanna now take it to a deeper level.

681
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,640
 Let's go down a notch now towards the bigger purpose

682
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,880
 of what the Holy Spirit is.

683
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,440
 He's a person to have relationship with

684
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,080
 so that we can shift from a give me to a make me,

685
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,720
 but why is that the case?

686
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,960
 What is it that the Holy Spirit

687
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,520
 is ultimately doing in our world?

688
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,720
 Well, to understand that, I wanna take you

689
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,080
 to a couple of passages of scripture.

690
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,720
 I hope this has been helpful for you so far,

691
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,560
 but this stuff's gonna really open up, I think,

692
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,240
 for you a bigger understanding of what the Spirit

693
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,120
 is going to do in us and in our world.

694
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,440
 The first time the Spirit is mentioned

695
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,640
 is in Genesis 1, verse two.

696
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,720
 Let me read you the first two verses of the Bible.

697
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,720
 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

698
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,600
 Now, the earth was formless and empty,

699
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,480
 and darkness was over the surface of the deep,

700
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,320
 and the Spirit of God, notice this,

701
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,720
 the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

702
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,400
 The very first time we're introduced to the Spirit

703
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,160
 is in the second verse of the Bible.

704
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,280
 First of all, we're introduced to the Father who creates,

705
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,040
 then we're introduced to the Spirit,

706
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,600
 and what we're told is that the world in that moment

707
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,640
 is this formless, dark void.

708
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,680
 Other translations would say there was chaos over the deep.

709
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,720
 Now, that would paint a pretty bleak picture

710
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,680
 right there at the beginning of the Bible,

711
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,280
 except for one thing.

712
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,840
 Actually, what this is presenting to us

713
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,360
 is a picture of hope, and the reason there's hope

714
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,240
 is because of the Spirit.

715
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,680
 Yes, the world was this dark, formless, chaotic void

716
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
 at the time, but it wasn't left alone.

717
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,800
 There's the Holy Spirit, and how is he pictured

718
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,440
 so poetically and beautifully?

719
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,320
 Hovering like a bird over creation,

720
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,200
 longing to wanna see creation take life.

721
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,480
 This hovering is a very unique Hebrew word.

722
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,520
 It's only mentioned one other time in Deuteronomy

723
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,560
 where it's spoken about an eagle hovering

724
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,960
 over the nest of its young,

725
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,200
 hoping that the young would take flight.

726
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,960
 That's the same concept here.

727
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,840
 A bird hovering over creation,

728
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,000
 longing for that creation to find its life,

729
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,960
 longing for that creation to come alive.

730
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,960
 Now, let me step back one second,

731
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,760
 because this is the primary thing

732
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,840
 that the Holy Spirit does.

733
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,120
 It brings things to life, but to understand that,

734
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,680
 you have to understand the Hebrew concept of life,

735
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,600
 which is different from how we in the West

736
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,920
 often think of life.

737
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,520
 In the Hebrew concept of life, it's not just

738
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,520
 about a heart beating and an ability to breathe.

739
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,360
 In other words, it's not just about like, I'm alive.

740
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,640
 The Hebrew concept of life was about the beating heart

741
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,800
 and the breathing, but it was also about fulfilling

742
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,440
 and becoming the greatest version of yourself

743
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,440
 that you can be, becoming fully as you were intended

744
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,760
 and created to be.

745
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,160
 This is the call of what the Hebrews meant

746
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,640
 by something having life, not just breathing,

747
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,680
 but actually being fully how they were intended

748
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,440
 and designed to be.

749
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,080
 So if I was gonna define the Hebrew definition of life,

750
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,040
 I would say this, having life is living to the best

751
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,760
 of our created intent.

752
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,560
 Some of you should write that down,

753
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,560
 because that's actually gonna shape so much of your future,

754
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,040
 just that one thought, living to the best

755
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,320
 of your created intent.

756
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,720
 In the Genesis narrative that we're looking at

757
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,000
 in this moment, this is the whole thing

758
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 that the Spirit is at work doing,

759
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,440
 helping things go from a place of formlessness in creation

760
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,520
 to a place of not just being alive,

761
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,640
 but being just as they were always intended to be.

762
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,520
 In Genesis 1 and 2, this is described to us as shalom,

763
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,720
 as the idea of wholeness and completeness,

764
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,200
 the fullness of the way things should be.

765
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,240
 This is the definition of life.

766
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,360
 And the way that the Holy Spirit is involved

767
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,520
 in bringing life, giving life,

768
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,400
 is not just helping us to breathe,

769
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,840
 but moving us towards the ways of intention

770
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
 of the heart of God.

771
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,880
 And that progression, that movement,

772
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,400
 is the Spirit bringing us life.

773
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,920
 So if that's the case, think of it this way,

774
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,680
 the closer that you are to being the person

775
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,120
 you were always intended to be,

776
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,920
 the closer you are to being fully alive.

777
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,040
 Are you following this?

778
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,240
 The closer you are to being the person

779
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,800
 that you were always intended to be,

780
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,920
 the closer you are to being alive.

781
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
 This is the Hebrew concept.

782
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,600
 Is that all making sense to you?

783
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,680
 Okay, so then we take that concept back to this passage

784
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,480
 where the Holy Spirit is hovering over a lifeless creation

785
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,160
 and he longs to bring it to life.

786
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,920
 He longs to take what's formless

787
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,800
 and bring it into the fullness of this life.

788
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,840
 And he does it with creation itself,

789
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,600
 but then there's this pinnacle of creation,

790
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
 the creation of humanity.

791
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,240
 And I wanna show you what happens in that moment

792
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,360
 of the creation of humanity.

793
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,440
 This is Genesis 2, verse seven.

794
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,600
 "The Lord God formed the man," or formed humanity,

795
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,240
 "from the dust of the ground

796
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,800
 "and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.

797
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,120
 "And the man," this was Adam in this moment,

798
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,600
 "becomes a living being."

799
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,040
 There's this beautiful moment.

800
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
 I want you to see what God does.

801
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,000
 He takes something that's formless,

802
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,280
 the dust on the ground,

803
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,560
 he shapes a form of man,

804
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,960
 and then he brings that into the fullness of a living being

805
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,640
 by the work of the Spirit.

806
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,480
 Does that make sense?

807
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,080
 So he breathes, that's one of the ways

808
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
 in which we come to think of and understand the Spirit.

809
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,400
 He breathes over this formed thing

810
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,360
 and brings it into the fullness

811
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,320
 of what it was always designed to be.

812
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,000
 This movement is a movement in Genesis 1 and 2

813
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,400
 from a work of disorder to a work of order.

814
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,080
 See, the Holy Spirit's primary purpose

815
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,640
 is to bring things to life.

816
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,320
 And the way that he does that

817
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,080
 is by taking things that are currently disordered

818
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,800
 and bringing them into order.

819
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,400
 You should take a photo of that slide.

820
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,120
 Because this shapes everything

821
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,120
 we're gonna do in the series ahead.

822
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,200
 This is the work of the Spirit,

823
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,120
 taking something that is disordered

824
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,560
 and moving it into this place of great order.

825
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,600
 This happens for creation,

826
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,440
 it happens for Adam.

827
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,560
 But then I want you to see what happens later in the story.

828
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,920
 Because later on in the story,

829
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,400
 of course we have sin that enters in chapter three.

830
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,640
 By the way, I want you to notice something.

831
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,840
 This is quite cool.

832
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,520
 The purpose of the Holy Spirit

833
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,000
 to bring things from disorder to order

834
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,800
 happens before the fall of humanity.

835
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,480
 In other words, his nature is not driven by sin,

836
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,360
 but by love.

837
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,480
 Oh, come on.

838
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,800
 Like before there was sin,

839
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,720
 the Spirit of God was already at work

840
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,520
 taking disorder to order.

841
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,000
 Taking things that were formless to form to fullness.

842
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,600
 Now sin heightens that work

843
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,760
 that the Spirit of God is going to do.

844
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,600
 And it heightens it

845
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,080
 because this is the very nature

846
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
 of the Spirit from the beginning.

847
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,720
 To out of love,

848
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
 wanna see things into their fullness

849
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,960
 just as they were created to be.

850
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,000
 This all culminates in our biblical story

851
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,840
 with the person of Jesus.

852
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,480
 And as Jesus steps into his role

853
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,680
 as a rabbi and a prophet and a teacher,

854
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,200
 and of course the Son of God,

855
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,520
 something significant happens in the narrative.

856
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,640
 Let me jump forward to Luke chapter three

857
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,560
 who provides a beautiful picture of this for us.

858
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,440
 Luke chapter three,

859
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,600
 this is the very beginning of Jesus

860
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,120
 stepping into his ministry.

861
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,640
 It happens at his baptism.

862
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,120
 Luke three starting verse 21.

863
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,160
 When all the people who were being baptized,

864
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,240
 Jesus was baptized too.

865
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,920
 And as he was praying, heaven opened.

866
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,760
 Notice this.

867
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,880
 And the Holy Spirit descended on him

868
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,800
 in bodily form like a dove.

869
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,080
 And a voice came from heaven and said,

870
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,200
 "You are my Son, whom I love.

871
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,720
 "With you I am well pleased."

872
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
 I want you to notice this.

873
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,320
 At the beginning of creation in Genesis one and two,

874
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,080
 there's disorder and chaos in the world,

875
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,120
 but there's hope

876
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,280
 because the Holy Spirit is hovering over creation.

877
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,000
 Interestingly, in the Aramaic version of the Old Testament

878
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,120
 that was basically the one that was read

879
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,680
 during the time of Jesus' ministry,

880
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,160
 Jesus and the disciples largely spoke Aramaic than Hebrew.

881
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,680
 In the Aramaic version called the Targum,

882
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,680
 the actual word in Genesis one and two is the word dove.

883
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,640
 A dove floating over the disorder of creation,

884
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,600
 waiting to bring it into the fullness of life.

885
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,240
 Fast forward to his baptism,

886
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,040
 people see a dove descend down on Jesus.

887
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,520
 In other words, what's happening here

888
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,720
 is God is basically saying a new creation moment

889
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,720
 is taking place in this person.

890
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,760
 Like I'm about to do something through the life, death,

891
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,560
 and resurrection of this one person

892
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,760
 that is literally like a new creation moment.

893
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,600
 In the old creation with sin, everything fell into disorder,

894
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,760
 but in the new creation with Jesus,

895
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,080
 what is disordered is gonna come back into order.

896
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,000
 What is broken because of sin

897
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,040
 is gonna find redeemed life in the forgiveness

898
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,000
 and the reconciliation that Christ will do on the cross.

899
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,800
 And this is signified by this moment of the dove again,

900
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,280
 the spirit saying what is disordered in this world

901
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,760
 will be brought to order because of this one person.

902
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,280
 Still tracking?

903
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,880
 Now, last week at Easter,

904
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,640
 the death and resurrection of Jesus,

905
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,640
 we celebrated, didn't we, this amazing moment

906
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,280
 where Jesus in his resurrection appears,

907
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,800
 the tomb is empty,

908
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,240
 and the burial shroud has been set aside,

909
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,000
 and then Jesus appears to his disciples in John chapter 20.

910
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Let me read this to you.

911
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,840
 This is pretty cool.

912
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,280
 In John chapter 20,

913
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,800
 this is the first time Jesus shows himself in resurrection

914
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,640
 to his disciples.

915
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,240
 In verse 21, he says this.

916
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,440
 Again, Jesus said, "Peace be with you.

917
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,520
 As the Father has sent me, I am now sending you."

918
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,320
 And with that, he breathed on them and said,

919
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,280
 "Receive the Holy Spirit."

920
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,160
 Does that remind you of anything?

921
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,600
 So get your head around this.

922
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,920
 Adam formed out of the chaos of the ground,

923
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,840
 formed into the shape of man.

924
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,240
 God breathed on him,

925
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,720
 so what was disordered would come into order

926
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,960
 and life would come,

927
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,280
 not just life in order to breathe,

928
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,040
 but life as the Hebrews defined it,

929
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,720
 the fullness of what it could be

930
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,440
 as its original created intent.

931
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,880
 Now in the resurrection,

932
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,160
 Jesus shows up to the disciples

933
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,680
 who have so much brokenness within them,

934
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,520
 who are struggling with the reality

935
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,480
 of whether Jesus was the Messiah or not,

936
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,680
 and he's just had this creation moment,

937
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,520
 new creation moment.

938
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,600
 He then breathes over them,

939
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,120
 just like God breathed over Adam,

940
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,840
 he breathes over the disciples.

941
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,400
 And what he's communicating that is he's saying,

942
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,520
 "Receive the Holy Spirit."

943
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,400
 In other words, my desire for you

944
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,440
 is that you would now come fully alive,

945
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,640
 that you would now become the versions

946
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,720
 that God has always intended you to be.

947
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,360
 Because I've defeated sin,

948
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,960
 because death no longer has the final say,

949
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,560
 you now can find life.

950
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,680
 And not just any kind of life,

951
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,320
 but the Hebrew defined life,

952
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,400
 where the Spirit is at work in you,

953
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,400
 taking you from disorder to a place of order,

954
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,200
 dealing with the sin and the brokenness that's within you

955
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,800
 and building you into redeemed life in Christ Jesus.

956
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,040
 You see that?

957
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,080
 Isn't that amazing?

958
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,760
 That the Spirit of God, the person of God,

959
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,980
 is breathed into us at the moment of our salvation

960
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,720
 so that we can go into the fullness

961
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,720
 of how we were always intended to be, alive.

962
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,680
 Now I want you theologically,

963
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,760
 just to stick with me one moment,

964
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,480
 as I theologically just explain this.

965
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,280
 In the incarnation, God stepped into the disorder

966
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,200
 of this world and through the Holy Spirit

967
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,040
 made everything just as it was intended to be.

968
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,600
 Does that make sense?

969
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,600
 Now, in the same way, Jesus Christ steps into the disorder

970
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,180
 of our internal worlds and through the person

971
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,240
 of the Holy Spirit makes everything

972
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,160
 just as it was intended to be.

973
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,680
 So what happens for the whole of creation

974
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,800
 in the incarnation now happens for us individually

975
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,920
 in the incarnation of Christ through the Spirit

976
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,640
 in the indwelling personhood of the Spirit in us.

977
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,420
 What was disordered in all of creation,

978
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,240
 what is disordered in all of us,

979
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,000
 is now brought into the fullness of its order

980
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,840
 through the work of the Spirit.

981
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,520
 Are you following me?

982
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,240
 So what does this mean for us?

983
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,200
 Well, it means everything.

984
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,800
 It means that all of that disorder that we are aware of,

985
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,280
 the hurt, the brokenness, the pain, the sin,

986
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,600
 the trauma that's been done to us,

987
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,760
 the things that we deeply wrestle with,

988
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,680
 the realities that we understand

989
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,760
 that there's darkness and chaos still within us,

990
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,820
 the stuff that no one else sees that we bury behind,

991
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,400
 the places that we haven't even invited Christ into,

992
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
 all of those things, God would say,

993
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,640
 I've placed the person of the Spirit in you

994
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,080
 so that whatever is currently disordered,

995
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,800
 that does not define you.

996
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,760
 'Cause the work of the Spirit is always to take things

997
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,480
 that are disordered and to bring them into order.

998
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,080
 So when we say, Lord, more Holy Spirit,

999
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,840
 what we're actually saying is I need more order.

1000
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,560
 I need to become the very person

1001
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,560
 that I was originally created to be.

1002
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,360
 This is the way that in the New Testament

1003
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,680
 begins to speak of this work of the Spirit amongst us

1004
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,240
 and I wanna show you one final slide

1005
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,920
 to help pull this all together for you.

1006
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,000
 This is the work of the Spirit bringing disorder to order.

1007
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,440
 So the Scriptures tell us that the Holy Spirit

1008
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,480
 brings us to faith in Jesus, helps us to know Jesus better,

1009
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,520
 restores our relationship with the Father,

1010
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,880
 drives us into mission and justice,

1011
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,440
 binds us together as the body of Christ in unity,

1012
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,200
 empowers our living worship and discipleship.

1013
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,920
 All of this is what the Holy Spirit now does

1014
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,120
 in that indwelling disorder to order reality in our lives.

1015
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,240
 And here's the important thing.

1016
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,680
 This is a cyclical thing that happens in us at all times.

1017
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,120
 And there might be seasons where one of these

1018
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,880
 becomes more prominent for us,

1019
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,080
 but the Spirit of God is at work in us at all times,

1020
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,960
 bringing us into a greater place of order.

1021
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,840
 And I think sometimes we think it's like,

1022
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,720
 I'm just gonna do step one, step two, step three,

1023
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,800
 and then I'll get my certificate

1024
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,400
 to say I'm a great Christian.

1025
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,680
 We in Hong Kong love that, don't we?

1026
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,720
 Give me the linear thing that I need to do

1027
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,960
 to get the certificate that it says I've done it.

1028
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,480
 That's not the way the Spirit works in our lives.

1029
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,240
 There's a chipping away and a change within us

1030
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,720
 that takes time sometimes.

1031
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,320
 But as that work of the Spirit happens,

1032
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,760
 the disorder over years becomes order.

1033
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,520
 And this is how we're gonna break down our series with you.

1034
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,760
 This is the final part of the slides.

1035
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,600
 You can take a photo of this if you'd like,

1036
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,240
 but these are the six, seven weeks that are ahead of us,

1037
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,000
 the six weeks ahead of this week,

1038
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,320
 where we're gonna each week break down

1039
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,920
 one of these elements for you

1040
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,960
 and help you to understand how the work of the Holy Spirit

1041
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,640
 changes the bigger picture of everything in our lives.

1042
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,120
 Is that helpful?

1043
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,840
 Okay, I wanna finish with two questions

1044
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,240
 that I want you to wrestle with this week.

1045
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,360
 This is our homework this week.

1046
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,960
 Come to church for homework.

1047
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,800
 It's great.

1048
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,640
 But these are two questions that I want you to sit with

1049
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,880
 and wrestle with personally in the week ahead.

1050
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,000
 Okay, here's the first question.

1051
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,360
 If the person of the Holy Spirit

1052
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,320
 is someone to be in fellowship with,

1053
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,440
 am I actively cultivating a vibrant

1054
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,440
 and personal connection with him?

1055
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,560
 Do I see him still more as a force or energy to tap into

1056
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,720
 than a person to walk with?

1057
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,520
 Okay, I want you to do some wrestling with that

1058
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,880
 in your own quiet time in the week ahead.

1059
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,720
 And the second one is this.

1060
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,520
 If the work of the Holy Spirit is primarily

1061
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,280
 to take things that are in disorder

1062
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,320
 and bring them into order,

1063
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,040
 what is currently still in disorder in my life?

1064
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,040
 Where do I need to invite the Holy Spirit

1065
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,280
 to enter and reorder?

1066
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,520
 Helpful?

1067
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,600
 All right, can you stand with me?

1068
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,040
 I would love to pray for you.

1069
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:16,640
 Maybe you'll be open to that posture

1070
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,320
 of just humility and openness

1071
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,160
 by opening your hands once more before the Spirit of God.

1072
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:27,680
 Father, we stand before you as the Vine Church

1073
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,800
 in this season of uncharted waters,

1074
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,960
 desperate to deepen our relationship,

1075
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,840
 our fellowship with the person of the Holy Spirit.

1076
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,960
 Father, I pray for each person here,

1077
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,880
 for the journey that they're on over the next seven weeks.

1078
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,080
 Lord, I thank you that you are going to be helping us

1079
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,960
 to understand the both end of you,

1080
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,720
 the dramatic things that perhaps we're most aware of,

1081
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,160
 and the quiet things that you're doing within us

1082
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,760
 that perhaps even right now we're not aware of.

1083
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,120
 Lord, I pray over this series

1084
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,440
 that you would help each person in this room,

1085
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,880
 those watching online now, those in our overflow,

1086
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,200
 be strengthened in their understanding of the Spirit,

1087
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,640
 and therefore strengthened in their inner person.

1088
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,800
 Lord, for any of us here where we would admit

1089
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,160
 that our primary way of thinking about the Spirit

1090
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,920
 is mostly like a force or an energy,

1091
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,040
 and not a person, Lord, would you help us this week

1092
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,880
 to recalibrate the way in which we think,

1093
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,800
 to engage in a different way of worship,

1094
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,520
 to understand that our posture

1095
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,320
 is not one of tapping in and gaining.

1096
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,680
 Our posture is one of knowing and submitting.

1097
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,560
 And Lord, I pray that that would be important

1098
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,720
 for some of us in this room

1099
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,320
 at the beginning of this series.

1100
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,880
 Lord, I wanna pray for the disorder

1101
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,440
 that I know that is still in my life,

1102
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,880
 and the disorder that I'm sure

1103
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,200
 is in every person's life in this room.

1104
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,080
 Lord, we thank you for where you've already taken us

1105
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,480
 by the work of your Spirit.

1106
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,560
 We thank you for the ways in which we are better people

1107
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,640
 than we were a year ago, two years ago, five years ago.

1108
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,920
 But like we started this time,

1109
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,400
 we speak against the narrative of the enemy

1110
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,560
 that would try to constantly keep us

1111
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,400
 away from the progression of healing

1112
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,760
 that the Holy Spirit is doing in us.

1113
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,800
 And Lord, I wanna pray that any areas of disorder

1114
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,720
 you would awaken us to in the next seven weeks.

1115
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,880
 And I pray, Lord, that as your Spirit convicts us

1116
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,720
 of some of the areas of our lives

1117
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,480
 that we haven't fully submitted

1118
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,840
 to the sovereignty of the Lord Jesus,

1119
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:35,840
 Lord, that we would do so in grace and expectation and hope.

1120
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,440
 I thank you, Lord, that there is no condemnation

1121
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,480
 in Christ Jesus, but there is conviction

1122
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,920
 by the kindness of the Spirit of God.

1123
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,240
 And Lord, I pray that if any of us need

1124
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,320
 that conviction of your Word,

1125
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,540
 Lord, that we would be humble enough

1126
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,560
 to submit ourselves to the reordering

1127
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,840
 that you wanna do in our lives.

1128
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,520
 Lord, I thank you for the freedom that is coming.

1129
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,880
 Lord, I thank you that what is ahead of us

1130
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,160
 is greater than what is behind us.

1131
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,520
 I thank you that that same Spirit

1132
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,520
 that raised Jesus from the dead is in each one here.

1133
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,640
 And Lord, in that, would you come and have your way

1134
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,200
 and have your being?

1135
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,140
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

1136
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,940
 Everyone says, "Amen."

1137
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,400
 Let's worship together.

1138
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,900
 (congregation applauding)

1139
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:39,900
