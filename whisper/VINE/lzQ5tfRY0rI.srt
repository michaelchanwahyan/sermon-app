1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 you know, during Chinese New Year, we love to go to different places, different homes to visit each other and say our blessings.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 So today, we're going to do something special for our message.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 We're going to visit Pastor Vivian and Elder Sidney at their house as they're delivering today's message.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Hey dear, it's Chinese New Year. Why don't we make some Tong Yuen as we often do to celebrate the Chinese New Year?

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Yes, sure. The Tong Yuen is often made sweet in your family, whereas in my family, it is made salty with a lot of other ingredients.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Yes, true. It could represent that our family longs for something sweet in life.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Whereas for your family, you look for a rich and abundant life.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Well, the Chinese Tong Yuen are usually rambish regardless of various traditions. They may signify wholeness, perfection and many others.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Wow, that is prophetic. I just read from the Message Bible the other day.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 The famous verse in Philippians 4 actually tells us that let's petitions and praises shape our worries into prayers, letting God know our concerns.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Before we know it, a sense of God's wholeness, everything coming together for good, will come and settle us down.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 [Music]

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Well, just now we are making the dumpling rambish. I think it actually releases a desire to see that there is a restoration to wholeness, reunion and reconciliation into the whole matter.

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Well, actually, as a surgeon who stitches up a bounced wound and brings along healing, I guess I have my own perspective of Yuen.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 As in recovery, restoration in Fu Yuan.

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Every time I perform surgery, we're actually inflicting some degree of hurt, which we call necessary pain.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But it is warranted because we can achieve the healing that is desirable.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 For instance, during the Chinese New Year, I actually did a little bit of artwork.

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 We cut into the buds of this water lily and in time, when nourished in water and nutrients, given the right season, then it will blossom for the new year.

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 In that sense, even for a very traumatic year for the society, the new year also spells a new season.

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 It will take time, but together with the right measures, we shall recover or even blossom.

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 That crucial time just can't be rushed.

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 But then pain is a gift as it points to practical reality, help us recognize where we stand and how far we may stretch ourselves literally when we recover from some of the lost functional abilities.

25
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I love the book, The Gift of Pain, written by an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Paul Grant, who spent decades working for leprosy patients in India.

26
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Through his dedicated work, he observed that the patients lost their fingers, hand or foot due to neglect to repeated hurts of their body just because they lost their sensation of pain.

27
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 That is, pain actually alerts us to that we are being hurt. Something sinister needs to be tackled.

28
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 On the other hand, as the proper treatment has been conducted, progressive decrease in pain reassures us of the ongoing healing in good progress.

29
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Well, as a mom, I would say most mothers would agree giving birth to a child is one of the worst pain experiences.

30
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 However, there is much to celebrate for new life and the natural longing for family to come together to celebrate.

31
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Well, on the other hand, even as a physician, I recognize that there is some spiritual dimension of pain.

32
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Didn't Paul plead for his thorn in the eye to be removed?

33
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 But then Christ's grace is sufficient and His strength is made perfect in weakness.

34
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 He must have been painful for Paul. At the end, he learns to be humble before Christ as he experiences His sufficient grace.

35
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Coming back to your Yuan metaphor, I do see Tang Yuan as more signifying wholeness, be it physical or emotional healing from wounds.

36
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 It's just part of the journey to wholeness.

37
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 The R for Rundish metaphor reminded me of what I learned in Wholeness and Inner Healing Prayer Ministry that its ultimate goal is reconciliation.

38
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 In particular, there will be a process of reconciliation to God, to others, and to oneself.

39
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Let's have a look at these five R's in the process of reconciliation.

40
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 First, recognize our sinful reactions to hurts and the sinful patterns that affect self and others.

41
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Second, confess and repent for ways we judged those tempted us to form judgments and expectancies, to believe the lies, and to make inner vows.

42
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Third, release forgiveness to others and oneself.

43
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Fourth, reckon as dead our sinful reactions and patterns on the cross.

44
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Fifth, allow God to resurrect us, to bring new life.

45
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 It is also very important that while we long for bearing good fruits for the new season, we must get rid of all the bad roots.

46
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 So the physical closure of the year is only a timely reminder that we have to literally chop off the bad roots in our lives before we can be renewed to bear fruits different from before.

47
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Only a proper closure sets us ready for something anew.

48
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Yes, indeed, proper closure and then a new chapter.

49
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Since we have the testimony from our own community member, whose relative had a very traumatic experience of going through a very difficult medical condition.

50
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And yet no definite plan can be formulated because of the complexities in making the diagnosis.

51
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 With the COVID restrictions in the hospital throughout those few months of agony, he was nursed in isolated facilities and no visitation was allowed.

52
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 All the discussion of the management of the patients was just with the relatives over the phone.

53
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Yet the risk of surgery was so high that no firm decision could be made, despite a long stretch and every hope seemed to be fading.

54
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 As a surgeon myself, logically speaking, I understand that it is almost a daunting gamble to change gear, to switch facilities and to proceed to surgery.

55
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Yet the authentic faith of the family member, entirely entrusting to God, emboldened the decision.

56
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Against all odds, he made it through and almost miraculously.

57
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 As critical as the matter of life and death, the family members cried out to God desperately and sought prayer support and medical advice from friends and the spiritual community.

58
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 The patient himself, having gone through every miraculous piece, confessed Christ as his personal Savior.

59
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Again, his physical healing is only part of his healing journey.

60
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 There is much more than this, other than his reconciliation to God, there is reconciliation between himself and his family.

61
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 I am very convinced that the family being together to lend support to him makes a tremendous difference,

62
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 so that he gathered the courage to go through the painful surgery and challenging recovery.

63
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 In a year which is as difficult as this immediate past year, I would say community, even in the form of household or spiritual communities,

64
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 makes tremendous impact on how we cope with such uncharted and phantom difficulties.

65
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Instead of looking into our own interests or finding comfort in our sphere of supposed safety,

66
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 I would say we should make every outreach to others so that no one suffers in isolation.

67
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Yeah, but then it is almost ironic that while Tuen Yuen, Tong Yuen, means reunion, Tuen Yuen,

68
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 but then we can't have that reunion for our very own family.

69
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Oh my dear.

70
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I understand that as a family, we miss our son.

71
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 He is in lockdown mode, now going through his third wave in Melbourne.

72
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Yet we have to entrust God that he will look after him and provide for him.

73
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 He is alone, but he is not lonely.

74
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 He is being watched by him, and in days to come, we shall reunite.

75
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 For now, maybe we should just share the pain and distress of others who are isolated from their family and loved ones,

76
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 thousands of miles away, and many others who are stranded here in Hong Kong while this place may not be their home.

77
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 (Bells ringing)

78
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Hey Ivan!

79
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Happy New Year!

80
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Happy New Year!

81
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Thank you!

82
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Come in!

83
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Thank you!

84
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Please have a seat, Ivan!

85
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Okay!

86
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Happy New Year!

87
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I am very happy to be able to celebrate the New Year with you today.

88
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 I know that you have a family tradition,

89
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 which is to pour tea for you from the back of the glass as a sign of respect.

90
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Thank you!

91
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I know that your son, Christopher, your beloved son, is not in Hong Kong now.

92
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I hope that today, we can take this opportunity to send him our best wishes from the future generations.

93
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Thank you!

94
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 May God continue to bless and protect you.

95
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 May God also bless and protect your family members, so that they are not restricted by the geographical boundaries.

96
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Let's have some tea together!

97
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Okay!

98
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Let's have some tea!

99
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Let's have some tea!

100
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 It's time to make a wish!

101
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Oh, yes!

102
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Me and Vivian wish you all the best!

103
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Thank you! I wish you all good health!

104
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I hope that I can give you a New Year hug.

105
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Oh, that's great!

106
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Happy New Year!

107
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Happy New Year!

108
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Thank you!

109
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Ivan, thank you for your blessing.

110
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 You are our beloved descendant.

111
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 In the past seven years, we have been very happy to know you.

112
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 We are even happier to witness your relationship with God.

113
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 We are even happier to witness your life's transformation.

114
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 We are proud of you for facing many difficulties and suffering.

115
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Vivian, you have shared many special experiences.

116
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Why don't you share your personal stories with me?

117
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 It was indeed a difficult experience.

118
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 I remember that when I was still a firefighter more than ten years ago,

119
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I had a serious accident.

120
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I had multiple fractures on my face.

121
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 I had to undergo many surgeries.

122
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I had to undergo surgery for four years before I could recover.

123
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Just like what Sydney said,

124
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I had to experience physical trauma and how to get treatment.

125
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I agree that physical pain can really help us to know

126
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 where our body is in a bad condition,

127
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 where we need to get treatment,

128
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 and where we can recover.

129
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 But physical trauma can take more time,

130
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 mental effort to heal and recover.

131
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 This time, I had a post-traumatic stress disorder.

132
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 I was not in a good condition.

133
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I had a hangover, a bad temper, and even had a relationship with my ex-girlfriend.

134
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 The person who was under the greatest pressure was usually the one who loved me the most.

135
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Her heart was in more pain than mine.

136
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Would you mind sharing with us who you are hurting?

137
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 I am talking about my mother.

138
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 She even had a post-traumatic stress disorder.

139
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I love my mother,

140
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 but the trauma of this relationship made me unconsciously withdraw from the close relationship between us.

141
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 I realized that the more nervous I was, the more I would withdraw.

142
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I couldn't even call her "mommy".

143
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Would you mind sharing with us your father?

144
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Did he help you in this situation?

145
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 My father was another challenge for me.

146
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 He was a mental gambler.

147
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 I remember when I was in my teens,

148
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 he moved to another house more than 10 times because of financial problems.

149
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Since I was a kid, my father gambled and he brought a lot of damage to my family.

150
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I swore not to gamble like my father.

151
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But it was ironic that I gambled more when I was a gold minister.

152
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I was so happy every day, but I ended up in debt.

153
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 The only difference is that I didn't use thousands of lies to deceive my family.

154
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I lied to my family.

155
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Wow, I heard you had a very painful experience.

156
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But what we saw today was a very different Ivan.

157
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 What was the motivation and faith that led you to change so much?

158
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 You just shared that pain is a gift.

159
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 The pain in my body and in my relationship made my soul extremely empty.

160
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 But the pain brought a precious gift that changed my soul, which is the Christian faith.

161
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 There is a scripture in the Bible about reconciliation.

162
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 It is the 5th chapter of the Gospels, chapter 18-20.

163
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 "All things are in the hand of God, who has made it possible for us to reconcile with Him,

164
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 and has given us the discipline of reconciliation.

165
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 It is God who has made it possible for the world to reconcile with Him,

166
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 and has not condemned their transgressions,

167
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 and has entrusted us with the reason for reconciliation.

168
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 For this reason, we are the messengers of Christ,

169
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 and God has made us to preach to the world.

170
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 We also ask Christ to reconcile with Him."

171
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 This scripture has a deep impact on me.

172
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 This is a spiritual gift that affects my life and my daily life.

173
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 If it were not for God's grace and the people who love me,

174
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 I would not be able to overcome my pain and to pay off my debt.

175
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 But more importantly, I can reconcile with my parents.

176
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 In this process, I saw my life being transformed by Christ.

177
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I can help my father to understand that

178
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 he has to follow Christ and have a new life.

179
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Of course, he still has his own struggles in life.

180
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 But I believe that for everyone,

181
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 we all have our own struggles.

182
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 But for me, I have already forgiven him.

183
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I can still imagine and count his sacrifice for the family,

184
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 his concern for the family.

185
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 He has dedicated everything he can to the family.

186
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Ivan, you are sharing a wonderful journey.

187
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 You accepted your father and forgave him.

188
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 You even embraced him and thanked him.

189
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 This is a wonderful change.

190
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 We are very happy for you.

191
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 I can love my father as my son.

192
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 At the same time, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you.

193
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Thank you and Vivian.

194
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 You have built our faith community with the love of your parents.

195
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 You have taught us how to build a Christian-centered family.

196
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 I remember you held a mass in 2014 at the Divine Center.

197
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 This mass allowed us to express our love to our parents.

198
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 In the past few years, you have been training us on the faith.

199
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 You have shown us the true identity of a father.

200
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 You have also made us realize

201
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 the role of a father on earth.

202
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 You have shown us the love of a father.

203
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 You have made us realize the love of a father.

204
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Now, the love between my parents is more direct and natural.

205
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 We can celebrate the New Year together.

206
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Ivan, thank you for sharing your experience of mental trauma.

207
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I understand that the heart of Christ

208
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 needs to heal our mental trauma.

209
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 You may swear to be a different person.

210
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 In the New Year, others may swear to be a different person.

211
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Only God's power of transformation

212
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 can make our lives better and change us.

213
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Yes, only God's power of transformation

214
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 can make us change.

215
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 This is what the Bible says in the 4th chapter of the Old Testament.

216
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 God's Father's Messenger

217
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 helps the hearts of the fathers to turn to their children.

218
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 He also helps the hearts of the children to turn to their parents.

219
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 What we have heard from you

220
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 is the work of God in your life and family.

221
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 In addition to Christ, you mentioned that your wife has always been with you.

222
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Yes, I am very grateful.

223
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 My girlfriend, my beloved wife, Michelle,

224
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 her love, care, and her devotion.

225
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 I would like to share my second life change,

226
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 which is the commitment to our relationship.

227
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 My wife has accompanied me

228
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 through the most difficult time of my life.

229
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 We have committed to dedicate ourselves wholeheartedly

230
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 to each other as a lifelong partner.

231
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 We also hope to build a family that is faithful to Christ.

232
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 We also have a great blessing

233
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 to become a loving and lively parent.

234
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Family is not only about the family of a family of four,

235
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 but also the family of the church.

236
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 It has a great impact on my life.

237
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 We need companions to accompany us,

238
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 to care and encourage us.

239
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 We also need them to share our pain,

240
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 struggle, and setbacks.

241
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 At the same time, I have found that

242
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 when I am willing to try to care for my siblings

243
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 who are also facing challenges and failures,

244
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 we are actually encouraging and helping each other.

245
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Although my father has his own limitations and challenges,

246
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 he has always been teaching me.

247
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 At the same time, I have realized that

248
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 I need other people's wisdom to help me.

249
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Just like you, my famous predecessors,

250
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 you have taught me in my life.

251
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Thank you for witnessing

252
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 the relationship between me and Richie,

253
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 our marriage, and our family.

254
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 You have also helped us to understand

255
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 the beauty of God and the meaning of God to us.

256
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Actually, Ivan, we have witnessed

257
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 the precious legacy of God.

258
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Just like each of us is a descendant of God.

259
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 In the past year,

260
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 we have faced many challenges in different families.

261
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Our family is also a family.

262
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Our children have come from far away.

263
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 But we have seen that

264
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 God's grace, no matter where they are,

265
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 God will protect, guide, and care for them.

266
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 I also believe that in the future,

267
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 God's grace will also be with your family,

268
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 especially your two adorable children.

269
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Ivan, as your spiritual teacher,

270
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 we can bless you and your family.

271
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 It is our blessing.

272
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 In fact, in the past few years,

273
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 we have been able to share the blessings of the spiritual

274
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 with many of the brothers and sisters in the Chinese community.

275
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 It is really our great blessing.

276
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 I like the scripture you just mentioned.

277
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 It says that you are in the right path.

278
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Christ allows you to be in harmony with God.

279
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And you believe that God has entrusted you with the right path.

280
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 God allows you to be in harmony with your father.

281
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 God is in the right path

282
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 to prepare you to become a better father.

283
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Finally, I want to say that

284
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 only our loving God

285
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 can make a good work of life.

286
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Very good.

287
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Only God's work can make a good work of life.

288
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Sunny, as a father,

289
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 we would like to hear your blessings

290
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 and wishes for your family.

291
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I would like to thank the scripture for blessing my two sons.

292
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 I hope to see their wisdom and kindness.

293
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 And I hope that God's love for them will continue to grow.

294
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 I also hope that my marriage with my wife

295
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 will be more stable.

296
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Having a Christian child

297
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 is like the three-pieced ring of the ring.

298
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 It is not easy to break.

299
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 In my opinion,

300
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 the scripture says that

301
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 love and blessings can be passed on from generation to generation.

302
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 I hope that Christ will continue to transform me

303
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 and transform me to become a better father.

304
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 The relationship between father and son

305
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 or the blessing between generation to generation

306
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 is not only about how to deal with the tension between father and son

307
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 or how to guide them.

308
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 More importantly,

309
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 God's blessing can be a family legacy.

310
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 It is not only about the blessing on material or health.

311
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 We can use our next generation, our children,

312
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 to know that we have a father in heaven.

313
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 I hope that God will entrust him to me as their father

314
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 to show how much God's father loves them.

315
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 I have prepared some dumplings for everyone to eat.

316
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 I will go to the kitchen now to prepare them.

317
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Let's eat together, okay?

318
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Okay, very good.

319
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Let's eat.

320
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Okay.

321
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,240
 (glasses clinking)
