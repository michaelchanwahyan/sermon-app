1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
 Amen. Thank you, Jason.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,440
 Let's give Jason a round of applause.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,440
 That was a great leading.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,080
 And congratulations to June.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,080
 June has been accepted.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,480
 I'm so touched to see her being selected

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,960
 and to see how she has helped us improve our book.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,400
 Congratulations to everyone.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,040
 Because today is the last day of the audition.

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,040
 I don't know how you feel about the last 21 days of the audition.

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,840
 I heard everyone was sharing their experiences.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,400
 The two ladies next to me were sharing their experiences.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,440
 I was talking to them.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,640
 And I found out that they had some experiences.

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,440
 Maybe we'll share them together later.

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,280
 Today is the last day of the auditions.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,000
 I don't know how you feel about the last 21 days of the audition.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,640
 What do you feel when you start the audition?

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
 What do you expect?

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,800
 I remember when I first started this year,

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,320
 and I wrote the book for the first time,

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,480
 I was looking forward to what God would say to me.

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,920
 Especially last year,

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,640
 when we entered a new stage of life.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,240
 My wife and I were both thinking,

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,440
 we were both servants,

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,560
 we were both thinking,

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,880
 "After marriage, how will God use us?"

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,640
 "How will He serve us?"

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
 "How will we use the past two years?"

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,000
 I still remember the first week,

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,920
 when we started to eat lunch,

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
 I simply couldn't believe

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,960
 how God would keep talking to us that week.

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,560
 I was looking forward to every day of prayer,

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,600
 because you never know what God will say to you the next day.

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,080
 It was like God was giving us His will every day.

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,880
 Not only in the proclamation,

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,960
 but also when we were in our lives,

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
 when we were going through struggles,

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,800
 God was slowly showing us.

42
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,320
 I remember when we were 15, 16 years old,

43
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,760
 we were making decisions,

44
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,440
 and we didn't know how to apply them.

45
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,600
 God was actually opening doors for us,

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
 to give us a chance.

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,040
 When we were worried,

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,920
 and we were looking for something,

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,880
 when we were talking about how to deal with things,

50
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,560
 we received a phone call,

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,760
 and God was slowly opening doors for us.

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
 On the one hand, we were very excited,

53
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
 God was talking to us like that.

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,040
 On the other hand, we were looking forward to

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
 what would happen the next week.

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,800
 Would there be someone to give us a service offer?

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
 Or what?

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,560
 But when I went into the prayer the next week,

59
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,240
 the direction, the content of the prayer,

60
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,560
 even the tone was very different.

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,280
 God made me think of many people,

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
 many things,

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,160
 many passages from the past sermons,

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,480
 many points,

65
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,880
 or many emotions, many thoughts.

66
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,360
 The last time I had a speech,

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
 I was asked many questions.

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,560
 "God, do you really want me to do this?"

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,800
 "God, God,

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:14,800
 how can I fix these complicated relationships?"

71
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,360
 "My life's problems, my life's struggles,

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
 have been going back and forth for so many years,

73
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,960
 and they are repeating over and over again.

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,000
 How can I find a way out?"

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,680
 "In this state, I can still serve you."

76
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,920
 "What if I hear wrongly?

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
 What then?

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,480
 What should I eat tonight?"

79
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,440
 This is not it.

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
 But as a servant, as a missionary,

81
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,480
 the questions I just asked,

82
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,880
 it seems like you have a basic answer,

83
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,400
 you should know some answers,

84
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000
 but they are very real.

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,720
 These are the struggles I had that week.

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,240
 These are the weeks

87
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,680
 that I think about,

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,840
 or the situation inside me,

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,480
 the real situation.

90
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,440
 Richard Foster,

91
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
 in "The Early Morning Prayer,"

92
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,000
 quoted a poet to describe prayer.

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,840
 He said, "When we pray,

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,480
 God will slowly, gently,

95
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,240
 show us our hidden,

96
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,600
 or our so-called life situation,

97
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,280
 and reveal our life."

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,200
 Yes, I think it's very real.

99
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
 When we pray with all our heart,

100
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,320
 when we know,

101
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,680
 we will know more and more

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,400
 about the light of our life.

103
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,200
 Life is not just a place with light, right?

104
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,480
 It also has a shadow.

105
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,880
 Our life is not always

106
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,800
 full of beauty.

107
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
 Sometimes,

108
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
 or many times,

109
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
 our life,

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,960
 or the world we live in,

111
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,400
 our spiritual life,

112
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
 is full of tension,

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
 full of struggle.

114
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840
 Our life is sometimes full of two sounds.

115
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,120
 One is,

116
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,960
 "I only know that God is love.

117
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
 I know that I want to be immersed

118
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,440
 in a relationship with God.

119
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,120
 I also want to hear God say every day,

120
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440
 "I am in Him, I am valuable.

121
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,720
 We also have a mission.

122
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,760
 We are also people.

123
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,800
 God wants us to love,

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,840
 to serve,

125
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,880
 to touch.

126
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,480
 But on the other hand,

127
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,120
 we know that our life is full of problems,

128
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,960
 many difficulties,

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,720
 or some very difficult,

130
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,160
 very annoying things

131
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,520
 are inside us.

132
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,080
 We need to face and deal with them.

133
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,680
 They can be

134
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,400
 some very complicated dynamics in front of you,

135
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,600
 some very complicated relationships,

136
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,120
 or some situations that we love,

137
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,480
 our family members,

138
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,240
 or our loved ones,

139
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,120
 or some unknown things that are ahead of us,

140
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,800
 or some unfinished things in our lives,

141
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,320
 some relationships,

142
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,600
 our self-doubt,

143
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,440
 or even some harm that we don't want to be aware of,

144
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,640
 or even some sins.

145
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,880
 These two voices bring us tension,

146
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,320
 bring us inexplicable anxiety,

147
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,600
 and even

148
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
 entangle us in our prayer

149
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,880
 of how to listen to God.

150
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,960
 In a small town in Spain,

151
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,560
 there was a young pastor

152
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,440
 who received a phone call on Friday night.

153
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
 He was preparing dinner with his wife.

154
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,920
 While preparing, his wife said, "I'm going to listen."

155
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,520
 He went out to listen.

156
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,360
 When the pastor was preparing,

157
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,880
 he was looking back at

158
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,120
 the habit he had been repeating

159
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
 for a long time.

160
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
 He was meeting an old pastor

161
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
 as his mentor.

162
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
 The pastor suggested that he pray

163
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,760
 for an hour every day.

164
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,920
 After his wife came home from work,

165
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,640
 he would pray for an hour at home.

166
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,480
 He would spend time with God every day.

167
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,760
 He would listen to God's words.

168
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,080
 He would confirm his call.

169
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,680
 He would confirm that he would serve God.

170
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,760
 He was thinking that he would share a lot of things with his wife.

171
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,040
 After a while, he thought,

172
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,360
 "Why hasn't my wife come home yet?"

173
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
 He went out to listen

174
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,200
 and looked at his wife.

175
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,320
 At that time, his wife was holding her phone.

176
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,880
 She didn't say a word.

177
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,720
 She was like listening to her phone.

178
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,880
 The whole hall was quiet.

179
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,880
 The only sound was the voice

180
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
 from the phone.

181
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,400
 The pastor thought it was strange.

182
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,720
 He picked up the phone and listened.

183
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
 When he listened,

184
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,240
 he was not a stranger.

185
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,840
 He was a friend of his.

186
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,000
 He was a very familiar friend of his.

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,120
 He was actually a friend of his.

188
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,960
 When he listened,

189
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
 he was scolding them.

190
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
 He did a lot of things to hurt them.

191
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,720
 Do you know how he hurt other people?

192
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,160
 He even said something that he didn't remember.

193
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
 He kept scolding them.

194
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
 He only remembered the last sentence.

195
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,760
 He said, "You don't have to look after me and my family anymore."

196
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,240
 Then he stopped.

197
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,920
 At that time, he didn't know how to react.

198
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,520
 He listened to the phone and looked at his injured wife.

199
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,920
 He had a lot of questions.

200
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,560
 They didn't eat the dinner that night.

201
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
 They finished their work and went to bed.

202
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,320
 But they couldn't sleep.

203
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,640
 The pastor was thinking, "What happened?

204
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,240
 What did I do wrong?

205
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,520
 Why did you scold me like this?

206
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,320
 It's not fair.

207
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,600
 Why can this happen to us?"

208
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,120
 He couldn't sleep that night.

209
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,800
 He was even thinking,

210
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,800
 "In this place, there are so many things,

211
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
 I have so many problems,

212
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,800
 so many hurts.

213
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
 How can I continue to serve God?

214
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,520
 How can I continue to walk?

215
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,560
 Yes, we will struggle in our lives.

216
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
 I don't think anyone can do better than that.

217
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,600
 Even a person who serves God can't do better than that.

218
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,640
 Even if we have so many good experiences in the Bible,

219
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
 sometimes when a small thing happens,

220
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
 a small movement appears,

221
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,320
 it can easily overthrow our previous experience

222
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,480
 and bring a lot of struggles to our lives.

223
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,360
 When I think about this week

224
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,080
 or these three weeks of my Bible experience,

225
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,680
 I think about what kind of people are in the Bible,

226
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,440
 or even Jesus,

227
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,040
 how he experienced these struggles,

228
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,760
 how he faced the times when he struggled in his life.

229
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,320
 I think of the Gospel we are going to read today.

230
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,200
 Although Jesus is the God of all things,

231
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,480
 but he took the form of a human being to come to this world.

232
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,120
 He is also a man of all things.

233
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
 He will face struggles in his life.

234
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,480
 He also has feelings.

235
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,760
 When he faces the people who are against God in the Bible,

236
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,040
 he will be angry.

237
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,720
 When he faces his beloved Lazarus,

238
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,240
 he will be sad.

239
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,560
 When he faces those who are against God,

240
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,640
 you don't understand how to teach them.

241
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,320
 He will be annoyed.

242
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,480
 When he faces those who are in the midst of hardship,

243
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,440
 he will feel sad.

244
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,200
 But the Bible says,

245
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,240
 even if it is Jesus who has different struggles

246
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,200
 or different feelings,

247
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,760
 the Bible says that Jesus never committed a crime.

248
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,560
 He is a man who never committed a crime.

249
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,680
 He has experienced many trials,

250
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
 but he never committed a crime.

251
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,920
 Today, we will use Jesus' last sermon.

252
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,040
 Before he was captured,

253
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,360
 Jesus' last prayer

254
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,600
 is to use this sermon to see how God

255
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,640
 will tell us how to do in the midst of struggle.

256
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,280
 Let's pray together.

257
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
