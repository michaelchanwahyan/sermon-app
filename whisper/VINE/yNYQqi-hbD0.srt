1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,280
 Everyone says?

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,280
 Amen.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,440
 Hey, can we thank our worship team as always?

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,440
 So good.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,440
 Have a seat.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
 I want to say particularly a warm welcome to everybody at the two o'clock service.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,440
 It's great to have you here together.

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,400
 I'm sorry that I'm not with you in person today.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,600
 I'm currently on a plane flying to Singapore where I'm going to be teaching at a conference

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,600
 there all week.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,480
 So I couldn't actually physically be with you.

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,040
 But you're tuning into this and we're so glad that you're with us.

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,880
 And I pray that even though you're watching this on a screen right now, that God will

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,360
 speak to you and that you'll hear the Holy Spirit challenging you in the areas that he

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
 has for you today.

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,760
 So it's great that you're with us.

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,080
 And welcome to everybody who's here for the first time.

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,600
 If you've never been to the Vine before, my name's Andrew.

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
 I'm one of the pastors.

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,600
 And it's grateful.

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
 We're so grateful.

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,640
 Even on a rainy day, a rainy day.

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,200
 I am flying off to Singapore this afternoon.

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
 It's so funny.

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,880
 I like checked the weather because I'm like, I need to get away from this crazy rain.

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,240
 Like I'm so tired of it.

28
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
 I want to go somewhere.

29
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,520
 I'm going to see some sun.

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,280
 And I looked at the weather, the place that I'm going to be doing this conference in,

31
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,200
 and it's raining there.

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,560
 So praise the Lord Jesus.

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,600
 So we continue our series in Ephesus today, in Ephesians, the book.

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,920
 And we come to a passage that is very, very important to us as a church, very important

35
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,040
 to me as your pastor here.

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,520
 We come to what really is the central passage to, I think, Paul's whole book.

37
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,660
 It's pretty much in the center of his book.

38
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,680
 But it's also the central passage to us and our vision here at the Vine.

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
 And if you've been coming to the Vine, and there's people in this room that have been

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,480
 coming to the Vine for 10, 20, 20 plus years, my prayer today is that you'll hear something

41
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,960
 fresh out of the passage that perhaps you've heard us teach on a few times before.

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,280
 But if you're relatively new here at the Vine, and to be honest with you, we've just done

43
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,160
 a survey in the last month or so to ask about who you are.

44
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,440
 And we know that many of you here have only been a part of this church for, say, one year,

45
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,200
 two years, or even less than that.

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,960
 So we know that there's a lot of relatively new people.

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,040
 You may not have heard us speak about what is the central sort of heartbeat of our vision,

48
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,080
 why we do what we do as a church, and more than that, what our heart is for you.

49
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,680
 If you align to the Vine Church, and if you say that the Vine Church is your home church,

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,560
 then everything I'm going to speak about over the next 30 minutes is specifically about

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,560
 you.

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,040
 It's about you, it's about your life, it's about what the Holy Spirit wants for you,

53
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,400
 because if this is your home church, what I'm sharing is the heart of everything that

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,080
 we do here as a church.

55
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,680
 And the catalyst to this heart started back in around about March of 2013.

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,680
 It was about nine months or so before I took over here as senior pastor in November of

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
 2013.

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,680
 And in March 2013, I was praying, and if I'm honest with you, I was feeling very overwhelmed,

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,320
 I was feeling very nervous, I had imposter syndrome.

60
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,680
 We had two phenomenal founding pastors here at the Vine, John and Tony, that had done

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,800
 such an incredible job of birthing and growing a church.

62
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,760
 And I was feeling, if I'm honest, the weight of picking up at a relatively young age at

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,440
 the time, I was relatively younger at the time, picking up a large church and trying

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,520
 to lead it off the back of two gentlemen that had led it so beautifully and so wonderfully.

65
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,560
 So in all of those insecurities and that kind of sense of pressure, I went to God and I

66
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,960
 was just praying, I was like, "God, look, I just want to understand your heart for these

67
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,080
 people in the season that's ahead.

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,400
 Because if I can understand your heart for them, then I think I can kind of get over

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,800
 myself and my inadequacies that I'm sensing and lean into what your heart is for these

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
 people."

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,120
 And as I was praying that, I heard God speak and He spoke, perhaps what I would say is

72
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,440
 the clearest He's ever spoken to me.

73
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,160
 It would probably be a lie to tell you that I've heard the audible voice of God.

74
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,560
 I don't know what the audible voice of God is.

75
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,680
 But this was probably one of the times in my life where I've heard Him speak into my

76
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,200
 soul.

77
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,000
 His word just kind of hit me deeply in who I am.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Here's what He said, it was very simple.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,680
 He said, "Andrew, I don't want you to grow a big church, I want you to grow big people."

80
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,440
 And that shift changed everything for me.

81
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,000
 Because I was so anxious about taking on a large institution, a large church, and having

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,100
 to maybe grow that church even bigger.

83
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,040
 And God shifted it and He said, "Andrew, forget about the size of things, forget about the

84
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,840
 institution of it.

85
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,520
 What I want you to focus on is every single individual and my desire for them to grow

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,600
 in their relationship with me.

87
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,760
 I want you not to grow a big church, not that there's anything wrong with large churches."

88
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,880
 Again, the Vine over our three services is a relatively large church.

89
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,200
 But I don't want you to focus on trying to grow an institution, I want you to grow people.

90
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,280
 And I have to tell you, that resonated so deeply in me because I sense that that's my

91
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,840
 passion.

92
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,120
 That's everything that I want.

93
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,160
 I want you, and you've heard us say this at the Vine, if you've been coming for any period

94
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,680
 of time, you've probably heard this before.

95
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,200
 Whether you're here for two weeks, for two months, for two years, for two decades, I

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,360
 want you to grow in Christ Jesus.

97
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,840
 I want you to get to the end of a week and feel like because of your connection to the

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,240
 people in this room, because you feel like you're a part of a gathered community in Hong

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,960
 Kong, that you feel like you know Jesus more, you're deeper in connection with Him, you're

100
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,040
 walking more faithfully, you have a boldness to share the gospel like you've never had

101
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,560
 before, you have a mindset to understand justice and the vulnerable and the marginalized and

102
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,600
 wanting to make a difference, that you're looking at your workplace and the sphere of

103
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,000
 influence that Christ has planted you in, and you're saying, "How can I use the gifts

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,120
 and the talents and the spiritual things that God has given me to work out in the very place

105
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
 that I am?"

106
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,680
 Because you've heard this before, church is not 90 minutes on a Sunday, church is the

107
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,800
 gathered group of people wherever that might happen.

108
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,300
 That happens in the workplace.

109
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,320
 It happens in schools and universities.

110
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,460
 It happens with entrepreneurs.

111
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,640
 It happens in families.

112
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:06,960
 It happens in any place that someone who professes the name of Jesus is rooted and present, Jesus

113
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,600
 is there and they can bring heaven to earth in that place.

114
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,740
 And if there's anything that drives the heartbeat of the vine, it is that.

115
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,920
 We love gathering together in these 90 minutes on a Sunday, but this is not the fullness

116
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,940
 of what church is about.

117
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,000
 Church actually comes more alive when you wake up on a Monday and you get dressed and

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,760
 you go into your workplace and you spend the majority of your time with people who don't

119
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,640
 know Jesus.

120
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,240
 I envy you.

121
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,960
 I spend most of my time with Christians.

122
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
 And I have to tell you, no, I won't go there.

123
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,480
 You get to spend most of your time with people who don't believe, and what a beautiful, wonderful

124
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
 thing that is.

125
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,920
 So our vision here at the Vine is simply this, growing big people.

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,700
 Three words, that's it.

127
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,880
 Very easy for everybody to remember, growing big people.

128
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,200
 That's our desire, is that you would mature in your faith and that you would be so infused

129
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,640
 with the gospel, with understanding what that means through the life, death and resurrection

130
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,680
 of Jesus, through the birthing of the church and through the wonder of what it is to live

131
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,920
 reconciled with him, but also then to be in the ministry of reconciliation for others

132
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,640
 in the world that you're longing to grow and mature and deepen that relationship more and

133
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,080
 more as you go through life.

134
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,760
 For me, that's what this is all about.

135
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,640
 And I want you to hear this, we honestly believe here at the Vine that the local church is

136
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,000
 the hope of the world, the local church.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,880
 And again, by that, I don't mean a building or an institution or an organization.

138
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,520
 I don't even mean services.

139
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,760
 I mean you and me.

140
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,320
 I mean our relationships.

141
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
 I mean community.

142
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,400
 I mean the gathered group of God's people together.

143
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,560
 That is the hope of the world.

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,560
 It's the hope of the world because God has always chosen in redemptive history, right

145
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,880
 from the beginning of all things, from Genesis chapter four and then the calling of Abraham

146
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,640
 and the formation of Israel from Genesis chapter 12.

147
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,840
 What it's all been about is that God has said, "I'm going to reveal my character, my nature,

148
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,120
 my truth, my heart, my love through my gathered people."

149
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,040
 I mean that's what Israel was all about in the Old Testament.

150
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,960
 And that's why God gathers them at Mount Sinai and pours out his heart to them in the law

151
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,240
 because he wants them to be this physical representation of his character.

152
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,040
 That's what the gathered church is about.

153
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,400
 It's why Jesus told them to stay in the upper room until he pours out his spirit so that

154
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,080
 they could be filled with that law that is no longer on a tablet of stone, but is now

155
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,380
 written on the softness of their hearts by the spirit of Christ, the same spirit that

156
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,600
 raised Jesus from the dead, now given to them the birthing of the church so that they could

157
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,580
 then go out and represent the character and the heart and the passion and the saving grace

158
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,800
 of Christ Jesus to the world.

159
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
 That's what it's always been about.

160
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,480
 So if you want to know what the answer is to some of the greatest challenges that we're

161
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:14,360
 seeing in the world today, it is you and it is me, it is us, the church, the people of

162
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,200
 Christ.

163
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,360
 And see this is really important.

164
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,180
 The reason why our vision of growing big people is really important is because 91% of people

165
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,560
 in Hong Kong do not know Jesus.

166
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
 You know that?

167
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,640
 That's the latest statistic.

168
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:36,320
 91% of people in our city do not know Jesus, which means we have an awesome responsibility

169
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,240
 and an incredibly exciting...

170
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,280
 What other city would you want to live in than that?

171
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,000
 A city that desperately needs the very thing that sits in your heart, the very thing that

172
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,120
 has captured your life, the very thing that has transformed you and saved you and set

173
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,760
 you free, the very thing that wakes you up in the morning with your heart beating faster

174
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,840
 to say, "I'm so grateful that I know Christ."

175
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:06,440
 91% of the people in our city do not have that experience, but they could through the

176
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:13,720
 church, not by trying to get everybody in here, but by trying to release all of us out

177
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
 there.

178
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,400
 That's the river model vision here at The Vine.

179
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,120
 That's why we're growing big people, but we have this idea of the river model where all

180
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,320
 of us has a spirit influence that we're rooted in, where we get to live out the beauty and

181
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,820
 the wonder of the things that we talk about here on a Sunday.

182
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,920
 And that's important because what Christ wants for His church is that it would be His hands

183
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,500
 and feet in every aspect of society, in every part.

184
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:44,800
 And in this room right now and over our three services, even in the two o'clock, you represent

185
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,980
 the beauty and the wonder of some aspect of Hong Kong society.

186
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,600
 And what a powerful thing it is to think that the church is in the law firms, that the church

187
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,840
 is in the governments, in the corridors of power, that the church is in the police force,

188
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,560
 that the church is in our universities and education institutions, that the church is

189
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,720
 almost everywhere in our society, hopefully bringing the love of Christ to that place.

190
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,720
 See, the reason why this is important as well, the reason why we want to grow big people

191
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,920
 here is because a mature church is not easily shaken.

192
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,800
 And I tell you what, the world is shaking right now.

193
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,400
 With all of the economic challenges and the political challenges around the world, the

194
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,240
 world is more in war today than it has been five years ago, ten years ago.

195
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,600
 The world is more at war, not just physically and violently as we see around in various

196
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,080
 different conflicts, but at war culturally with each other.

197
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,080
 It's never been more like that than ever right now.

198
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,400
 And in the midst of that, wouldn't it be amazing if there was a presence of a group of people

199
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,880
 who, despite the fact that everything else was shaking and everything else seems scary

200
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,760
 and overwhelming, there was a group of people who were rooted in something, grounded in

201
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,600
 something that was so sure and so strong to them, that despite the fact that they may

202
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,000
 also feel a bit of fear at times, that they may also sense that there is this change that's

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 happening.

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,440
 They could say, "There is a rootedness that we can have, and I am not afraid because my

205
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,200
 hope is not here.

206
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
 My hope is in Christ.

207
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,720
 And because my hope is in Christ, I have salvation.

208
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,360
 I have a solid rock on which I'm building my life, and everything else can shake, but

209
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
 there is hope."

210
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,440
 I tell you, when you're living in a culture and a society and a city that is shaking like

211
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,800
 Hong Kong's is, people are looking for those who are secure.

212
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,040
 And they're thinking maybe that security is found in money.

213
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,680
 And when the economy shakes, everybody gets overwhelmed and fearful.

214
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,760
 Or maybe that security is found in some relationship.

215
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,520
 If I could just get married or date somebody or find the hot girl that I've been looking

216
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,040
 for or the stable guy that I want, we think that's where our security will come.

217
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,680
 And the church has the opportunity to stand up in the midst of all of those conversations

218
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,680
 and say that there's only one place where true security comes, and that's outside of

219
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,840
 yourself in the one who's the same yesterday, today, and forever.

220
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,400
 Which is why, when we're growing big people here at the Vine, we're doing it because a

221
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,480
 mature church can offer an alternative vision of life.

222
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,360
 I tell you what, in the conversations that I have, I know I just told you that I spend

223
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,800
 most of my time with Christians, which I do.

224
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,200
 But in the conversations I have with my non-Christian friends and the non-Christian community that

225
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
 I have, I constantly hear this communication.

226
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,120
 It's basically, "I wonder if there's another way to live because the system is not working

227
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
 for us right now."

228
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,720
 I tell you what, post-modernism has failed this world.

229
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,320
 It had this great hope when it started, but it's failed people, and they've realized that.

230
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,960
 Modernism, materialism failed us.

231
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,520
 Actually the extreme polarizations of elements of culture, extreme liberalism is failing.

232
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,840
 Extreme conservatism, the right-wing side of things, which has led to, in history, some

233
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,640
 really bad things, is failing.

234
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,400
 And so in the midst of that, people are looking for an alternative way of life.

235
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,880
 They are wanting, literally, to be awoken to the reality that there is another way to

236
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,200
 live that can bring hope and life and charity and kindness and goodness and actually see

237
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,960
 the world come together more than to be driven apart like it seems at the moment.

238
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,280
 And people are looking for where that alternative life is.

239
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,680
 And if the church remains silent, people are going to look over our heads to something

240
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,240
 else.

241
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,000
 And as we begin to speak up and as we begin to mature, as we begin to grow in our relationship

242
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,280
 with Christ, we begin to hold forth and hold fast the Word of God in the world.

243
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,080
 We begin to say, "This is a new way to live.

244
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,240
 This is a way that you can know peace where, even though the world might be going crazy,

245
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,160
 there's a solidness to shalom, to peace, to reconciliation that you can know right here

246
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
 and right now."

247
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,280
 Could you imagine Hong Kong as a city who, in this shaking time, would look out to a

248
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:51,160
 church that was so rooted in its maturity in Christ that people were like, "I want to

249
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,400
 be a part of that."

250
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
 That's our vision.

251
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,660
 I mean, that's really what Growing Big People is all about.

252
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,840
 I think God is looking for that kind of church.

253
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,160
 And I'm not saying that the Vine is that kind of church.

254
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,600
 I'm saying that's the cool, that's the goal, that's the challenge that Christ has placed

255
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,560
 upon us as a community here.

256
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,520
 I think this is essentially the kind of church that God is looking for.

257
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,600
 Let me read this to you.

258
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,160
 Filled with people who are confident in what they believe, mature in their experience of

259
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,160
 the kingdom and the works of God, literate in their understanding of His Word and its

260
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,400
 narrative, experienced in their healing and their restoration, skilled in their advocacy

261
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,480
 for justice, and planted with hope in the brokenness of the world.

262
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,720
 That's a church I want to be a part of.

263
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,360
 And again, by church, don't think Vine, institution.

264
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,480
 Think a group of people who believe this and have dedicated sacrificially their life to

265
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,960
 living out this.

266
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,360
 I think that's what Christ died for.

267
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,840
 I think Christ did not die for an immature church.

268
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,020
 Christ died for this kind of community.

269
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,640
 And my heart, our heart as a leadership here at the Vine, if you call the Vine your home

270
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,200
 community, this is what we're hoping to go towards.

271
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,860
 This is the goal that we're trying to attain to.

272
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,040
 This is what we're trying to move together in.

273
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,480
 And as we mature individually, we mature communally.

274
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:28,000
 And I believe we take steps towards becoming a church like this that could truly, truly

275
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,920
 change that statistic from 91% who don't know Jesus to whatever percent, hopefully, we can

276
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,760
 get it to where they do.

277
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,960
 Is anyone else excited about that?

278
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
 No.

279
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
 Okay.

280
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,160
 That's great.

281
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,600
 Now what I want to do is I want to show you how Paul, I think, places so much of what

282
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,960
 I've been talking about with you so far into this passage we're looking at today.

283
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,480
 As we continue our series in Ephesians, we come to Ephesians 4, verses 11 to 16.

284
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,800
 And this is Paul's growing big people moment.

285
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,400
 This is him explaining to his church in Ephesus his heart for them to mature and to grow.

286
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:15,080
 And not only does he explain the idea of it, he actually maps out a process in these verses

287
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,000
 by which his church could mature more.

288
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,880
 And I love this because what I'm going to do is, after I read it, is I'm going to break

289
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
 that down for you.

290
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,040
 I'm actually going to show you the process that Paul provides for his church because

291
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,720
 what Paul is trying to do in Ephesus, we're trying to do here at the Vine.

292
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,280
 It is to grow a church of mature believers for a purpose of trying to change the world.

293
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,360
 And that was definitely Paul's heart as a pastor.

294
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,520
 It's our heart here.

295
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,360
 So let me read this to you from Ephesians 4, starting in verse 11.

296
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,020
 It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, some

297
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,420
 to be pastors, and some to be teachers, to prepare God's people for works of service,

298
00:17:53,420 --> 00:18:00,100
 so that the body of Christ may be built up in unity, built up until we reach unity in

299
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,020
 the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, and we become mature, attaining to

300
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,900
 the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

301
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,220
 Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and

302
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,980
 there by every wind of teaching and by the cunningness and craftiness of people in their

303
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,380
 deceitful scheming.

304
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,740
 No, instead, speaking the truth in love.

305
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,100
 We will in all things grow up into Him who is the head, that is, Christ.

306
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,540
 From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds

307
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:37,500
 itself up in love as each part does its work.

308
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,300
 Paul has such a passion for his church in this moment because he wants them to see something

309
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,300
 that I think he felt they were failing to see up until this point.

310
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,340
 He's just spent three chapters talking about what Christ has done in His grace in their

311
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,540
 lives, and we've unpacked that in this series so far.

312
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,960
 But here in chapter four, he starts by saying, "I want you to live a life that is worthy

313
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,300
 of the calling you've received."

314
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,220
 And Susanna beautifully unpacked that for us last week as she challenged us to understand

315
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,140
 how we can walk in kindness and humility and goodness towards one another.

316
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,540
 Now Paul's going to take this idea of what it is to live a life worthy of the calling

317
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,340
 you've received and show you how that works in the church, how there is this process of

318
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:24,060
 living a life that's truly worthy of that calling through maturity in Him.

319
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,860
 And so I want to map this out for you.

320
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,900
 The first thing he does is he says, "Look, there's three things that are central to the

321
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,540
 idea of maturing in a church.

322
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,420
 Any church that is going to seek to mature people, you need to understand that God has

323
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,820
 created three specific elements that work for that.

324
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,260
 The first he talks about, which we've come in the modern church to call the five-fold

325
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,340
 ministry gifts.

326
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,300
 He just speaks about five types of giftings that have been placed in the church to help

327
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
 that church to grow.

328
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:00,320
 He says apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers.

329
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,300
 These are not professional employees.

330
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,520
 These are people within the church themselves that are walking and ministering and living

331
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,980
 in certain gifts that are for the maturity of the church itself.

332
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,900
 Now we don't have time today to unpack what those five different things are and the different

333
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,100
 nuances of each of them.

334
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,260
 It suffice to say that God has taken care of the community of His church by gifting

335
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,420
 it with such a way that there is diversity, there is different ideas of those gifts, they

336
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,300
 bring different things to the table, but seen together in their totality, they're designed

337
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,180
 to help the church to grow.

338
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,540
 They're designed to help the church to mature and to deepen in their faith.

339
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,660
 And so every church should be thinking, how do we have these five things at work amongst

340
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
 us?

341
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,580
 Again, they're not offices or they're not like titles.

342
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,460
 These are gifts that are at work amongst us so that we might be able to do something.

343
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,380
 And I'll explain what that do something is in a moment.

344
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,860
 But notice how Paul writes it.

345
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,980
 He says, "God has given some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be…"

346
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,180
 He doesn't say God is called.

347
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,940
 He doesn't say God is made.

348
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,860
 He says God has given these gifts.

349
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,260
 So the focus is not on the person.

350
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
 Look at me.

351
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,660
 The focus is on God gifting.

352
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:25,020
 In other words, it is a movement of His grace into a church community so that church community

353
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
 can grow.

354
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:32,740
 And because it's a gift, it's given in order to achieve and accomplish something.

355
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,620
 And I'm going to explain about that in just a moment.

356
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,260
 So the first element is there is these gifts that God has placed amongst us.

357
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,380
 The second element comes out in verse 15.

358
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,420
 He says, "Now speaking the truth in love."

359
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:50,160
 So Paul says not only is it important to have these five common gifts at work in your body

360
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,620
 to make it mature, you also need to be speaking the truth in love.

361
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,620
 I love this.

362
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,220
 Paul's saying a mature church is a church that doesn't shy away from the absolute truth

363
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:06,020
 of God, the absolute truth of Scripture, the absolute truth of the gospel and the life,

364
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,380
 death, and resurrection of Jesus.

365
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:14,540
 As a church embeds itself in the truth and shares that truth, speaks that truth, encourages

366
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,180
 that truth amongst them, it then grows and it matures.

367
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,940
 I love this.

368
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
 Speaking the truth.

369
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,020
 Now this is really important because I think in the world today, particularly in our postmodern

370
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,020
 context, there's been an attack on the idea of absolute truth.

371
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,620
 And instead it's all about subjective truth or relative truth.

372
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,180
 And whatever that subjective truth or relative truth is for you, you should embrace that.

373
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,260
 But it will be different for the subjective or relative truth for someone else.

374
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,340
 And you can't judge anybody else's subjective truth.

375
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,720
 And so what we've got now is a culture, even in our time right now, where you'll hear this

376
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,940
 phrase a lot, "Own your truth."

377
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,340
 Just own your truth.

378
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,260
 It's good for you to own your truth, which basically means you can believe whatever you

379
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,260
 want.

380
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,460
 I'm going to believe whatever I want and never the two shall meet.

381
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,780
 And I tell you what, us Christians, we've embraced this.

382
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,220
 I'm being honest.

383
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,860
 We've embraced this.

384
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,500
 This is how I think we so often are when we're around those that don't know Jesus.

385
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,780
 We're like, "Well, I've got my faith and I want to respect their space.

386
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,260
 And I have my faith.

387
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,500
 I have my truth.

388
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
 They have their truth.

389
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,900
 And we're just going to like that."

390
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,220
 I want you to know something really clearly.

391
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,780
 You don't have my truth.

392
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,980
 You have the truth.

393
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,160
 Come on, church.

394
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,640
 You don't have just, "This is my truth and that's something else over there."

395
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,540
 You have the absolute truth.

396
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,040
 The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus is an absolute truth.

397
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,640
 And Paul's saying the church matures when it doesn't shy away from the reality that

398
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,440
 there is an absolute truth.

399
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,560
 That there is something that the world revolves around.

400
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,200
 That there is a creator who's created this world and poured his heart and life into it

401
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,720
 and wants to have relationship with the people that he's created.

402
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,160
 When a church embraces and is willing to speak up for the absolute truth of Scripture, Paul

403
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,760
 says the church grows.

404
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,000
 It matures.

405
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,600
 The people there mature.

406
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,040
 And it's a wonderful thing.

407
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
 Notice this though.

408
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,000
 He qualifies it by saying, "In love."

409
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,560
 Which is another problem because the church over history hasn't done that.

410
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,720
 They've taught the absolute truth, but sometimes not in love.

411
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
 From a posture of judgment.

412
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,520
 From a posture of finger pointing.

413
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,160
 From a posture of, "You're not as good as us and you need to get better, so hear this

414
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
 truth."

415
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:35,480
 Paul says, "No, we don't shy away from the absolute truth that we're rooted in as Christians,

416
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,880
 but we do it, we share it, we speak it in love with one another and with those out there."

417
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
 It's done from a place of love.

418
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,080
 And remember, he's just prayed a prayer to them at the end of chapter three where his

419
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,800
 pastoral prayer was all about, "I want you to be changed inside through your knowledge

420
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
 of the love of God.

421
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,880
 I want you to know the height and the depth and the width and the length of that love.

422
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,480
 And I want that love to so transform you that it will surpass your understanding and it

423
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,400
 will fill you with the fullness of God."

424
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,320
 He's just prayed passionately that they would know love.

425
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,480
 Then he says, "Now speak the truth out of the overflow of the love that's in you."

426
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,560
 When you share the absolute truth of the gospel with someone from a place of love, you share

427
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,560
 it not from a idea of, "I need to judge this person because their behavior is bad."

428
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,760
 You share it from, "Man, I so long for this person to flourish and grow and be just like

429
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
 me, transformed."

430
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:29,480
 Because could you imagine the lawyer they could be if they actually believed in Christ?

431
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,280
 You're looking at it from a completely different perspective because you want the person to

432
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,440
 grow and flourish and be the best that they can be.

433
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,600
 And your heart's somewhat broken that they're not living in the way that God has created

434
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
 them to be.

435
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
 But you're not judging them.

436
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
 You're sharing the truth in a place of love.

437
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,560
 Paul says, "When that happens, you have a mature church.

438
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:51,400
 An immature church shies away from absolute truth."

439
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,680
 And I know that's not a popular thing to say, so I'm going to say it again.

440
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,300
 An immature church shies away from absolute truth.

441
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:05,760
 But a mature church is willing to stand on the truth of Scripture, but do so in love.

442
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,320
 The third thing he says is he says, "You've got to understand that Christ is the head

443
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,020
 of the church and we are his body."

444
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,360
 So he shares about there's an authority structure in the church.

445
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,720
 Not an authority structure that's human made, an authority structure that comes with Christ

446
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
 as the head.

447
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,800
 But the authority is in him.

448
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,360
 He said this at the beginning in Ephesians chapter 1.

449
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,680
 He said, "The will of God is that all things on heaven and earth would come under one person,

450
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
 that is Christ."

451
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,160
 So Christ is the ultimate authority, he says, but he gets, "We are his body."

452
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
 We get to be his body.

453
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,760
 And this is a beautiful thing because as the body of Christ, we get to be different parts.

454
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,400
 Our differences are a good thing.

455
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,120
 Our backgrounds and our talents and our gifts that are different from one another, they're

456
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,200
 all good things.

457
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,000
 As we bring them together in this one body, we build each other up.

458
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 It's a beautiful thing.

459
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 We grow in Christ.

460
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,080
 We mature, he's basically saying.

461
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,960
 And so this idea of being a body means not all of us are the head, not all of us are

462
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,600
 the hand, not all of us are the feet.

463
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,680
 Some of us are this, some of us are that.

464
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,120
 Some of us are even the spleen.

465
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,960
 Nobody wants to be the spleen, but some of us in this room, you're the spleen.

466
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,040
 That's the metaphor he uses in 1 Corinthians 12.

467
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,360
 We're all different parts of the body, but together we make up this wonderful thing.

468
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,880
 So Paul is saying a maturing church happens because there are servants that are there

469
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,440
 to serve, there's revelation that is heard amongst us, and there is a community in which

470
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,120
 is developing in that space.

471
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,680
 So servant-hearted leadership, revelation of God's truth, and a community of people

472
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,000
 working together is part of the journey of maturing the church.

473
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,480
 And Paul's saying if those three things are not at work, you will fail to see a maturing

474
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
 church.

475
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,080
 And if those three things are not at work in your life, you will probably fail to mature

476
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,720
 yourself in the way that Christ would want you to mature.

477
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,840
 Those three things are non-negotiables.

478
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
 Helping so far?

479
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
 Yes.

480
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
 Thanks, Ellison.

481
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,480
 Actually, I just heard everybody at the two say yes.

482
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
 Thanks, two.

483
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
 I appreciate you.

484
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
 All right.

485
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,880
 Now, look what happens next.

486
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,040
 So he's just said, look, there's three elements.

487
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,280
 He said these three elements work towards one goal.

488
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
 Notice this.

489
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,760
 He says, "So that they would prepare God's people for works of service."

490
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,600
 Ah, I love that.

491
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,320
 Notice he doesn't say, "So that they would prepare God's people to come to church on

492
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
 Sunday."

493
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,000
 He doesn't say that they'll prepare God's people to feel better about themselves.

494
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,400
 He says, "These things prepare God's people for what he describes works of service."

495
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,080
 So Paul's vision for a maturing church is not a church that's passive, a church that's

496
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,920
 active.

497
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,880
 His vision for people that are a part of a church is not that they would come in and

498
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,640
 only receive, but that they would be actively doing and giving and working out there somewhere

499
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,200
 in the world.

500
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,280
 His vision for a church that's maturing is not a church that's filled with people who

501
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:58,240
 are just here to consume, but a church that's filled with people that are dying to contribute.

502
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,040
 Because all of these things, this idea of servant leadership, revelation, and community,

503
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,360
 they're all working towards preparing God's people for the works that God has for them

504
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,680
 to do.

505
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,240
 The three things on this side are the things that we should be supplying to you here at

506
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,320
 the Vine as your leadership, and how you should be supplying to one another, but it's to prepare

507
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,720
 you to go and do something.

508
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,680
 I think one way of thinking about it is this, the servants in the church are to prepare

509
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:30,080
 the church so that the church could be the servants to the world.

510
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,040
 Come on church, do you follow that?

511
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,800
 So the servant leadership within the church is to prepare the church to be the servant

512
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,740
 leaders of the world.

513
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,800
 So you could be in your marketplace situation, in the law firm, in the school, in the university,

514
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,880
 wherever it is, the family, whatever, and you're there going, "How do I do this for

515
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
 the people around me?

516
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,960
 How do I serve?

517
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,280
 How do I share the gospel?

518
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,420
 How do I live out the character and the nature of Christ to the people around me?

519
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,320
 Because I have been equipped by my community together to be a work of service to the community

520
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,040
 I'm planted in.

521
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,760
 But my sphere of influence, I'm the pastor to that sphere of influence," you should be

522
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
 thinking.

523
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,120
 "I'm God's hands and feet to that place, and I can make a difference because of my community

524
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,140
 of faith and how we're serving one another and working together.

525
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,520
 We can be living out acts of service wherever it is that you're planted."

526
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,480
 I think that's a glorious vision for church.

527
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,320
 It's not about like, "Hey, let's all come in and contribute everything here," although

528
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,940
 we do need you to contribute things here, right?

529
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
 We need volunteers.

530
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
 We need our helpers.

531
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,240
 We need the worship team.

532
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,720
 Everything that you see pretty much on a Sunday, most of it is run by volunteers.

533
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,040
 Yeah, we need the help here, but really the heart that Paul has for the church is that

534
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,320
 it would be so equipped for the work that it has to do out there.

535
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,200
 And that should inspire you.

536
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,400
 That should fill you with a hunger to want to mature so that you can be a greater representation

537
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,860
 of Christ's hands and feet wherever it is that you might find yourself.

538
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,840
 So Paul says all of this stuff, what it does as we prepare our works of service is that

539
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,720
 it brings unity together.

540
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,000
 We are built up, as the church says, in unity.

541
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 I love that.

542
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,800
 In other words, everybody here, if we were actually living out the call of the gospel

543
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,960
 in whatever sphere of influence we are, our role amongst each other should be to cheer

544
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
 each other on.

545
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,920
 It should be to say, "Wow, did you hear what this person did in the law firm the other

546
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
 week?

547
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
 It was amazing.

548
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,400
 They were able to do this because they had this mindset of what justice was and the heart

549
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,920
 of God and justice, and they did that.

550
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
 We want to cheer you on.

551
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,160
 We want to say, 'That was awesome.

552
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
 That's great.'"

553
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,120
 Or, "Hey, do you know that this person who's the CEO of this massive company, they're really

554
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
 struggling right now.

555
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,200
 They're under a lot of pressure.

556
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,000
 We need to gather around as a church and pray for them and stand with them so that they

557
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,880
 can be all that Christ has called them to be in that place in this season."

558
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,480
 Or, "Hey, you know this single mother who's having to raise two kids and she's struggling

559
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,880
 to pay rent every week?

560
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
 Hey, come on.

561
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,480
 We should be gathering around and building unity together to help her and provide for

562
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,040
 her and do whatever we can to make sure she's the best mom to those kids that she could

563
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,120
 possibly be."

564
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,440
 Could you imagine a church who's doing all of this stuff so that they could see unity

565
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,640
 be built up amongst themselves?

566
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,200
 That's something people would want to be a part of.

567
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,560
 And this unity, Paul says, he said, "We build up this unity in two very specific things."

568
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:23,440
 He said, "The unity is found in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God."

569
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,400
 Faith and the knowledge of the Son of God.

570
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,360
 This is what happens when unity is at work amongst us.

571
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,120
 We have unity in faith and unity in knowledge.

572
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,600
 Paul often brings faith and knowledge together when he's teaching.

573
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,320
 And he does so because it's really important for him because these two things are slightly

574
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,920
 different emphasis for Paul.

575
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,160
 Faith for Paul spoke mostly about our experience with God.

576
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,760
 It spoke about our beliefs and our promises, our understanding the promises of God and

577
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,400
 our trust in Him.

578
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,640
 The faith element was the bits where we don't understand, where we need faith.

579
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,600
 Maybe we haven't got it all worked out in our mind so we have this faith to believe

580
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,160
 or faith to trust or faith to embrace the promises of God, even though perhaps we don't

581
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,960
 fully understand them at times or maybe we haven't felt them at times.

582
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,460
 We have this faith in us, he says, and we have this unity together in faith in the Son

583
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,460
 of God.

584
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,440
 But then he also says, "But it's also a knowledge."

585
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,480
 It's not all just about faith.

586
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,840
 It's also about being rooted in understanding, having wisdom, having good doctrine, understanding

587
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,800
 theology, understanding the Scriptures.

588
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,160
 This side is also important, Paul is saying.

589
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,840
 Our unity, if you're a maturing church, our unity if you're a maturing Christian, is that

590
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,160
 you have feet in both of those camps, that you have a balance between your faith in the

591
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,360
 Son of God and you have a balance with your understanding, your knowledge of the Son of

592
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,360
 God.

593
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,040
 And he's like, you need to get both of those things in balance because if one of those

594
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:53,600
 things dominates more over the other, then you're going to be an immature church that's

595
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,720
 likely to be shaken by every whim of teaching that's going to come your way.

596
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,480
 And we all know this, right?

597
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,800
 We all know those churches or those experiences where it's all built on just some spiritual

598
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,120
 dramatic experience, and yet it seems to lack the rootedness of Scripture.

599
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,480
 And perhaps we've been in other churches at times where it's amazing the doctrinal understanding

600
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,080
 and teaching and yet it seems like it's dead, that it's not alive, that there's no spirit

601
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
 involved.

602
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,840
 And Paul's trying to teach the church where our unity comes, our maturity comes.

603
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,920
 When we take both of those things and we embrace them and walk into them and find balance in

604
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,600
 our lives, here at the Vine we put it this way, we want you to be a spiritually intelligent

605
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
 Christian.

606
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,160
 We want you to be so filled with the Spirit that you have those experiences of Christ.

607
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,560
 You're gifted by the Spirit.

608
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,860
 You know that the same Spirit in you is the one that raised Jesus from the dead.

609
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,120
 You're praying for the sick.

610
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,320
 You're looking for miracles.

611
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,400
 You're expecting for that.

612
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,400
 We want that in you.

613
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,280
 But we also want you to know your Word.

614
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,560
 We want you to be rooted in Scripture.

615
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,420
 We want you to understand theology.

616
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,120
 We want you to know how the Bible works.

617
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,920
 We want you to stand on that absolute truth and have that.

618
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,040
 We want you to have both of those things at work in your life.

619
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,480
 That's maturity, Paul says.

620
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
 That's what it is to grow.

621
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,040
 Are you still with me?

622
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,280
 So all of this reaches to the end of the point where he says this, and so we would become

623
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:16,240
 mature, and notice how he defines maturity, "attaining to the whole measure of the fullness

624
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,800
 of God."

625
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
 The whole measure of the fullness...

626
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
 Yeah, that's a good slide to take a photo of.

627
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
 Yep, everybody's taking a photo of that.

628
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
 That's nice, isn't it?

629
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,680
 Although, ha, ha, ha, ha, there's one more bit, so sorry.

630
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,520
 You're going to have to take a photo again in a few minutes' time.

631
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,080
 But I want you to see, he's saying we become mature, "attaining to the whole measure of

632
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,360
 the fullness of Christ."

633
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,840
 Paul's vision is that you wouldn't miss out on anything that Christ has for you and for

634
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
 the church.

635
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,760
 The fullness of Christ should be found in you and found in the church.

636
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,920
 He's basically saying, look, Christ did not die so that you received a portion of His

637
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,000
 love.

638
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,360
 Christ didn't die so that you would receive a portion of reconciliation, a portion of restoration.

639
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,040
 Paul's like, no, a mature church and a mature person in Christ is someone who understands

640
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,400
 that they are receiving the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

641
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,000
 We don't do the vines so that you would get a half measure.

642
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,800
 I mean, if that was our focus, then we may as well just wrap up and go home.

643
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,680
 We do this because we want you to sense the wholeness of His love, the wholeness of restoration,

644
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,840
 the wholeness of your healing, whatever brokenness that you're with, whatever addiction you're

645
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:34,400
 struggling with, whatever overwhelming fear is in your workplace, whatever it is, divorce

646
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,800
 that you're struggling with in your marriage, a breakdown in a relationship, whatever it

647
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,680
 is, we want the wholeness of Christ for you in those areas so that you would feel fully

648
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,280
 alive in Him, forgiven, redeemed, restored, growing and making a difference so that you

649
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,720
 would have a limp like Jacob did, who wrestled with God because of the hard things and God

650
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,640
 touched him and he walked away touched by the work of God and able to reveal the beauty

651
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,960
 of His brokenness to those ahead and to point people towards the one who healed him.

652
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,520
 And I pray that that is us, that that is what it means to be church.

653
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,120
 That's growing big people.

654
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,200
 And the question you've got to wrestle with here is when you see Paul map out, I mean,

655
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,820
 is that not a beautiful process that he's mapped out?

656
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,600
 When you see Paul map out a process like that, here's the question we think.

657
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,380
 We think that Paul's being mean about people who are infants in Jesus.

658
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,780
 We could read that and think Paul's got a problem with people who are just coming to

659
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,180
 Jesus or don't know much about Jesus.

660
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,940
 And if that's you here in this room, maybe you're new to faith or maybe you're wrestling

661
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,140
 with faith, you're not sure, I want you to hear this.

662
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,980
 That is not what Paul is saying.

663
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,220
 He is not coming against those who are infants in the faith.

664
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,860
 Equally, there are people who are mature in Christ Jesus who think because they've been

665
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:54,780
 Christians for 30, 40 years that they don't have much more to learn about Christ.

666
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,140
 He's coming for those people actually.

667
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,140
 And he's saying both whether you're an infant in Christ or whether you think you're mature

668
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,620
 and you've got it all sorted out.

669
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:07,540
 He's basically saying if you just stay stagnant where you're at, that's not what Christ wants.

670
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,660
 He wants a maturing church, a maturing Christian.

671
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,740
 And so if you're an infant, that's absolutely fine.

672
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,580
 Your heart though should be, I want to learn, I want to grow, I want to deepen, I want to

673
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,580
 get mature.

674
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:24,500
 And if you are a "mature" Christian, you should be challenging yourself and saying, have I

675
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,380
 plateaued, have I thought in arrogance that I know it all?

676
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,620
 Is there more for me to know of Christ?

677
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,620
 Absolutely there is.

678
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,060
 And so whether infant or mature, the heart Paul is saying is that you have a starting

679
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,100
 point right in this process right now.

680
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:43,060
 Whether you've been a Christian two weeks or two minutes or 20, 30, 40 years, there's

681
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,980
 a starting point for you and that's the final part of the slide.

682
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,400
 You can now take a photo of the slide if you want to.

683
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,280
 There is the starting point that we all have.

684
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,500
 And that starting point is what you're being invited into today.

685
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:03,980
 If this is your home church, I hope what I've shared with you today out of Paul's vision,

686
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,660
 remember, this is not actually the Vine's vision as in like we've come up with something

687
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,980
 special.

688
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:13,940
 Our vision is that vision and that vision is Paul's vision for his church, okay?

689
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,980
 This is Paul mapping out what maturity in the church looks like, but that is what we

690
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,660
 align ourselves and that's what we mean when we say we're here to grow big people.

691
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,920
 That's what we're talking about.

692
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,140
 That's everything we do strategically.

693
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,300
 We want that process to be at work in our ministries and how we do things.

694
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,700
 We want that process to be at work in your life and everything you experience.

695
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,420
 We'd love that process to be at work outside the four walls of a 90-minute Sunday service.

696
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,720
 That's our heart and our passion.

697
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,980
 The question you've got to ask yourself is where are you starting on your ever going

698
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,460
 maturity journey today?

699
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,620
 And so for some of you in this room, your starting point might be like, "You know what?

700
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,380
 I need to understand more about the truth.

701
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,800
 You know what, I've shied away a little bit from God's absolute truth.

702
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,080
 Maybe I've been a bit scared about it.

703
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,080
 I need to actually embrace it.

704
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,820
 I need to read my scriptures a bit more.

705
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,300
 I need to talk to somebody about that.

706
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,600
 I need to understand what are the foundations of gospel.

707
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,760
 I need to understand what is doctrine.

708
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,080
 I don't even know what doctrine is or theology.

709
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,460
 I need someone to walk with me.

710
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,860
 Maybe it's to sign up for a BSF class or do a manna class here at the Vine where we do

711
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,200
 Bible teaching with you.

712
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,260
 It could be a whole variety of different things, but you're kind of saying, "That's my starting

713
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,260
 point."

714
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,080
 Or maybe for some of you it's to get into a community group.

715
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,400
 You realize that you've been anonymous here too long and you've been wondering why it

716
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,520
 is that maybe you're not growing as much as you thought.

717
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,160
 Let me tell you this, you will grow far more with eight to nine to ten people around your

718
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,420
 life who know your story and you know their story than you will from attending a lifetime's

719
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,720
 worth of 90 minutes on a Sunday.

720
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,760
 That's where true discipleship takes place.

721
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,400
 Not here, as much as we love what we're doing here.

722
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,600
 I know I've said that a few times today, but we love this, but that's actually not the

723
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,960
 fullness of your discipleship.

724
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,880
 Your discipleship will go to the next level when you commit your life to communing with

725
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
 people.

726
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,240
 So, CGs, community groups, massive.

727
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,620
 Maybe that's your starting point here today.

728
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,920
 Maybe your starting point is to say, "Hey, look, I want to be equipped more for works

729
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,920
 of service.

730
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,920
 I realize I've become stagnant.

731
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,100
 I realize that I basically just live my faith on a Sunday and I don't live my faith much

732
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,100
 outwards.

733
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,560
 I realize that God has gifted me, but I'm not really using those gifts."

734
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,120
 You're thinking, "I want to actually think about what it means for me to serve the city

735
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,480
 of Hong Kong, to serve my bank, to serve that law firm, that educational institution, whatever

736
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,320
 it might be, serve my family.

737
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,200
 I want to learn more about that.

738
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,320
 That's my starting point."

739
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,240
 Or maybe for some of you, it's this faith in the knowledge.

740
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,840
 "I want to get that balance better in my life.

741
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,120
 I've got a little bit too much of the experience.

742
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,200
 I feel like I'm lacking."

743
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,240
 Or, "I feel like I've got too much of this, but I want to learn what are the gifts of

744
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
 the Spirit like.

745
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,040
 I want to have somebody pray for me to receive some of the gifts.

746
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,120
 I want to do more of that."

747
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,920
 And so, maybe it's like you want to get that balance of faith and knowledge better in your

748
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
 life.

749
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,320
 I don't know what it is for you, but my challenge is, if this is your church, this is what we're

750
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,320
 about.

751
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,800
 And I said this at the Aniphothene.

752
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,600
 I want to say this again, and I'm saying it to you at the two as well.

753
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,480
 And I'm not joking this.

754
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
 This is everything that the Vine is about.

755
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,180
 So if this doesn't excite you, or if this is not what you want, I totally respect that,

756
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:05,280
 and I would say, "Go check out some other churches."

757
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,440
 And I mean that because this is who we are, and this is what we're going to pour our time

758
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,080
 and energy and leadership into.

759
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
 This is what.

760
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,480
 And if you align with this, every Sunday when you come in, my heart and my prayer is that

761
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,920
 you'll feel like you're growing.

762
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,240
 You'll feel like you're maturing.

763
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,520
 You'll feel like you're being challenged.

764
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,640
 You'll feel like the truth is being spoken in love.

765
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,600
 You'll feel all of those things, and that will help you to grow.

766
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,520
 And if you align with that, then the starting point is your question today.

767
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,440
 How am I starting in that journey?

768
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,360
 And I pray that this excites you as much as it excites me.

769
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,320
 And this is what's going to continue to be at the forefront of us as we hold forth and

770
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,840
 fast to the Word of God amongst us.

771
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,560
 Can I pray for us?

772
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,520
 Why don't you stand with me, and I'll pray for you.

773
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,960
 I hope people come back next week, though.

774
00:42:52,960 --> 00:43:00,800
 I did kind of mean that, but hopefully you resonate with what we're talking about.

775
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,720
 Things you regret later.

776
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,960
 Okay.

777
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,480
 Father, we just are so grateful that we are here together.

778
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,960
 And I wonder if this is resonating with you.

779
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
 This is your home church.

780
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,280
 Can I just encourage you to just put your hands out as I pray, and I want to just commission

781
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,000
 you into the things that we're talking about.

782
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,080
 And if you're visiting from another church or somewhere else, you can receive, of course,

783
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,880
 receive this as well for whatever context Christ has planted you into.

784
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:33,720
 So as your hands are open, Father, we thank you that you called the vine to grow big people.

785
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:39,320
 Thank you, Lord, that each person here represents a wonderful, created human being that you

786
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,960
 love so much, that the image of God is placed within, and that you're wanting to see flourish.

787
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:52,880
 Father, I thank you that we have amazing doctors and nurses and teachers and educational professors.

788
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,160
 We have entrepreneurs.

789
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,360
 We have people in politicians, people in the government, police.

790
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,280
 Lord, we have all aspects of societies represented across our services.

791
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,920
 Lord, that is such a beautiful thing.

792
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
 Thank you.

793
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,520
 Thank you, Lord, that you've blessed this community with variety and diversity.

794
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:16,760
 Lord, I want to pray that there will be a unity felt amongst us as you build us up for

795
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,120
 works of service.

796
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,840
 Lord, I want to pray for each person here who's saying the vine is their home church.

797
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,960
 I want to pray that this starting point that you're putting on their spirit right now would

798
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,880
 be their next step in deepening their journey with us as a community of faith.

799
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,640
 More than that, deepening their own journey in relationship with you, Lord.

800
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,320
 I pray that we as a church will be able to serve that next step as best as we can, knowing

801
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,960
 that we won't always get it right and that we'll make mistakes along the way.

802
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,160
 Lord, I pray that more than that, the people of this room would love each other, would

803
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,720
 love and encourage and cheer each other on deeply in the spirits of influence and the

804
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,640
 works of service that they are doing.

805
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,560
 Lord, I want to pray that there would be such unity at the vine between experience of you,

806
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,960
 the heart and the faith and the works of the spirit and the power that there is in the

807
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,720
 spirit as well as the depth of your word and the roots of doctrine and good theology.

808
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:17,280
 And Lord, I pray that those two things would come together in a beautiful way, Lord, that

809
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,400
 we would find ourselves deeper in knowledge and in faith of the Son of God.

810
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:27,480
 And Lord, I pray for that whole measure, the whole measure of the whole measure of the

811
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,880
 whole measure of the fullness of Christ over each person.

812
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,680
 And so Lord, today as we respond in worship, Lord, I want to just pray, maybe just you

813
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,200
 take the time as we worship now to think about what is my next step?

814
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,000
 What is my starting point?

815
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,700
 And maybe after the service you want to come forward and have someone pray for you.

816
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,280
 Maybe for some of you that's the foster care situation we were talking about earlier.

817
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,080
 You know, those next steps might be things that you're going to do, making room for God

818
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,360
 by serving the poor and the vulnerable, the marginalized of our city.

819
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,960
 Maybe some of you want to do that as a next step.

820
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,800
 It might be a lot of different things, but take the time to hear from the Holy Spirit.

821
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,160
 And if you'd like prayer, we're going to have a team that will pray for you at the end of

822
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,360
 the service around that as well.

823
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,400
 But as we respond, we do so asking Him to mature us and to grow us into big people.

824
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,760
