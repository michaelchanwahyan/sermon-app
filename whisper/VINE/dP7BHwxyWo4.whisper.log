[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.500]   Amen.
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.960]   - Amen.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.620]   Well, before I start, there is one more thing
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.080]   that Jess forgot to share.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.200]   During her time away, she came back quite different,
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.800]   actually, Jess came back as an engaged woman.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.080]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.920]   Yay!
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.160]   So congratulations to Jess.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.640]   Yeah, there she is.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.260]   Whoa, yeah, there it is, look at it.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.100]   Ah!
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.160]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.000]   So shiny.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.960]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.000]   So big congratulations to Jess and Ken.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.840]   We look forward to welcoming him to our community soon.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.880]   He's moving here, right?
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.800]   Yeah, you did it right.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.640]   Good.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.300]   Good.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.720]   Well, good morning, church,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.640]   and if you're joining us online and overflow,
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.520]   good morning to you as well.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.840]   I'm gonna have a question.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.760]   When you daydream, what do you dream about?
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.960]   Like when you're sitting at your desk pretending to work,
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.560]   you know, and like you're staring at the screen,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.200]   but really your mind's somewhere else.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.360]   What are some things that you find yourself thinking about?
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.160]   You know, imaginations,
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.280]   things that you wish would happen to you.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.120]   Okay, I'm about to give you a little bit more insight
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.480]   into the strange and wonderful mind of Alison.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.320]   Okay, I'm only doing this 'cause this is a safe place,
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.680]   I hope, all right?
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.280]   And if you didn't already think I was weird,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.620]   maybe now you'll know.
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.000]   Most of my daydreams involve some sort of
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.480]   breaking out of obscurity and into the limelight, right?
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.760]   It's kind of weird, okay?
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.960]   And for example, I used to do a lot of running,
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.720]   so I used to imagine myself
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.040]   like running the Hong Kong marathon, okay?
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.680]   And then, you know, I'm running the Hong Kong marathon,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.560]   I'm running, and suddenly, right, I break through the pack,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.520]   and then on TV it's like, "Whoa, who is this guy?
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.880]   "He's so super fast!"
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.320]   You know, I'm like leading the race,
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440]   and I set a world record pace, right?
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.240]   And everyone's like, "Whoa, out of nowhere
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.200]   "comes this guy, his name's Alison," right?
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.440]   And he's such an amazing runner, something like that.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.200]   Or maybe I'm at a concert, you know,
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200]   we're at a John Legend concert, right?
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.640]   And then he's playing on the piano,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.880]   and suddenly he's lost his voice, and he falls sick,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.360]   and he's like, "I'm gonna need someone
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.760]   "to close out the show."
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.960]   Okay, it's like, "You, sir,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.520]   "you look like you're a good singer."
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.000]   Okay, "Say less, John Legend!"
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.420]   Okay, and I get on the piano, and I start playing,
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.880]   I don't even play the piano, right?
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.120]   And then everyone's like, "Whoa, wow,
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.460]   "this guy's even better, right?
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.600]   "Like, our ticket was well worth the money,"
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.120]   something like that, okay?
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.040]   Okay, last one, okay, promise you.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.560]   Right, I'm walking down the road, right,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.880]   and suddenly I come across a dangerous situation, right?
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.960]   And there's these bad guys
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.880]   that have kidnapped a bunch of children.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.720]   And I happen to be in the right place at the right time,
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.760]   and because I've been training martial arts
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.000]   and hand-to-hand combat secretly, right,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.840]   like Liam Neeson in "Taken," I say to them,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.440]   "I have a very particular set of skills,
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.280]   "skills I've acquired over a very long career,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.100]   "skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.040]   "Let these kids go now, and that'll be the end of it.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.520]   "But if you don't, I will find you,
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.760]   "and I will kill you," right?
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.800]   And then, like, you know, I go,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.960]   and I take down all the bad guys and save the day,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.300]   and I was like, "Yeah, what a hero, okay?
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.240]   "Pray for me," right?
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.240]   These are just things that go through my mind
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.340]   when I'm wondering.
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.400]   We come to the story of Elijah today
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.120]   in our "Encounter with God" series.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.440]   And the reason I told you those things
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.560]   is because this is sort of how Elijah burst onto the scene.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.400]   You know, he is a man sort of appearing out of obscurity,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   appearing out of nowhere.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.120]   We're not really given much about his background
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.120]   or who he is, but it's not long before we find out
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.120]   that this isn't just any old person or any normal prophet.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.940]   And we find that Elijah is a guy
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.800]   that you really don't wanna mess with.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.360]   No, he's not perfect, but he is a powerful prophet,
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.360]   able to do amazing things, a force to be reckoned with.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.800]   But it's not because he has any sort of special skills
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.920]   or he's particularly intimidating or anything like that,
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.320]   but rather it's because God is working through him.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.280]   It's because he has these amazing encounters with God
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.760]   and God keeps speaking to him, working through him.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.440]   And through these encounters,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.700]   he hears and obeys what God calls him to do.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.840]   And then throughout history, Elijah,
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.800]   especially for the Jewish people,
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.440]   Elijah is regarded as one of the greatest prophets
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.040]   of all time.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.600]   And today he is still honored and revered and respected.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.360]   In Jewish culture, during the Passover meal,
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.920]   the door is left open at one stage
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.800]   in anticipation that perhaps Elijah would return.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.200]   He is the most mentioned prophet in the New Testament.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.360]   In fact, Elijah was so amazing, he was so great
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   that he didn't, one of the few people,
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.080]   one of two people in scripture,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.480]   maybe even in all history, that didn't experience death.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.140]   He was taken up to heaven in chariots of fire,
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.200]   never having experienced what it means to die.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.560]   So today, as we look at Elijah,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.880]   we're gonna look at a few ways
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.840]   that this prophet encountered God.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.720]   How it shaped him, how it molded him,
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.620]   how it equipped him to do what God had called him to do
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.240]   and what this means for us today
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.360]   as followers of Jesus in today's age.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.080]   So we're gonna look at the Bible and see what it has to say.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.320]   1 Kings 17, one.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.980]   Again, this is all we know about Elijah,
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.820]   right at the beginning.
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.080]   Now Elijah, the Tishbite from Tishbe in Gilead
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.880]   said to Ahab, "As the Lord, the God of Israel lives,
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.720]   "whom I serve, there will neither be dew nor rain
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.600]   "in the next few years, except at my word."
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.240]   Now before we get into the details,
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.680]   it's gonna, I'm gonna give you a little bit of context.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.080]   It might be helpful to see the state of Israel
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.720]   at this moment.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.480]   So after entering into the promised land,
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.360]   we talked about Joshua a few weeks ago.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.520]   Remember entering into the promised land.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.080]   They've established themselves as a kingdom, right?
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.360]   They have these kings and under King David,
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.600]   Israel becomes the most powerful and prosperous
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.340]   and dominant nation in the whole entire world.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.480]   Things are good and God is faithful to the covenant
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.120]   that he's made with his people, right?
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.040]   This will be a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.880]   You'll be prosperous.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.960]   Everything you need will be provided for.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.240]   God is blessing his people.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.560]   And King David dies and his son Solomon
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.600]   takes over the throne and this continues, right?
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.440]   This is like the golden age in Israel's history, right?
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.200]   Solomon is a king known for his wisdom, right?
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.080]   His amazing wisdom, which was given to him by God,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.040]   but also for the riches that even nations and leaders
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.520]   from far away places would come and marvel
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   at just how powerful Israel had become under God's blessing.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.560]   That is, of course, until Solomon's heart
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.640]   turns towards idols, right?
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.520]   And we're told towards the end of his life,
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.320]   the woman, the people that he marries, right,
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.520]   has, the many women that he marries,
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.520]   have turned his heart away from God towards these idols.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.440]   And this violates the commitment
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.440]   that Israel had made with God.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.360]   The first two commandments say this, right?
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.560]   You shall have no other gods before me.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.000]   Second, you shall not make for yourself an image
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.960]   in the form of anything in heaven above
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.200]   or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.240]   You shall not bow down to them or worship them.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.320]   So there's a consequence to their sin.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.240]   And as a consequence, God says the kingdom of Israel
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.920]   is no longer gonna be unified and peaceful as it once was,
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.600]   but it's gonna be torn in two.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.920]   And the peace and prosperity we see comes to an end.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.480]   And from then on, we see Israel
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.200]   with a long and complicated history, right,
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.720]   of going through different kings, different leaders.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.000]   Sadly, most of it involves them constantly being enticed
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.800]   to worship idols and false gods,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.200]   which leads to them being invaded by other countries,
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.040]   taken away into exile.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.960]   They've turned away from the government
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.000]   that they first had with God
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.880]   and started doing evil in the sight of the Lord.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.680]   So God sends prophets and messengers
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.640]   constantly to his people.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.680]   And these prophets warn people, right,
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.840]   messages of correction, messages of consequences
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.320]   in order to let people know,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.040]   hey, we're going in the wrong direction.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.240]   Remember who God is.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.600]   Remember the God that brought you out of Egypt.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.280]   Remember who he is to us.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.440]   Turn your hearts back towards him.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.720]   These are always an invitation, right,
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.440]   to say, come back towards me.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.720]   This is your rightful place,
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.720]   not with these other gods and idols that you've turned to,
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.960]   but with me, the one true God.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.800]   And I'm emphasizing this because when we look
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.160]   at these stories in the Old Testament sometimes,
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.240]   God seems like a grumpy, heartless old man, right,
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.920]   someone who's only interested in punishing his people
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.480]   for the bad thing that they've done.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.640]   But when we look a little bit deeper,
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.000]   we see the motivation behind God's actions.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.960]   And his heart is never just to punish
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.600]   for the sake of punishing,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.920]   but he corrects, he leads people back,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.240]   and yes, there are consequences,
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.880]   but it's always out of love.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.760]   And God's heart is that none of his people should perish.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.200]   And we actually see God is a merciful God.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.640]   And he's not just angry at the way
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.720]   that Israels have turned their hearts away from him,
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.480]   but actually his heart is broken when we turn away from him.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.360]   He doesn't want his people, his children,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.640]   to be worshiping idols because he wants them close to him.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.760]   He wants them safe.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.000]   He knows that the only place,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.120]   the best place for them to be,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.360]   the way they were designed to live
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.320]   is in close relationship to the creator.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.280]   Again, not because he's some great control freak,
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.120]   but because this is truly the way God has called us
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.880]   and designed us and created us to live,
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.680]   in steadfast, in relationship, in obedience to him.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.440]   So God has to let us know, I want you close to me.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.480]   And every time you break that promise,
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.360]   every time you turn away from me,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.920]   there are gonna be consequences,
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.360]   real and serious consequences
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.520]   that you'll have to face in your habitual sin.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.480]   And it's in a moment like this, in Israel's history,
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.080]   that Elijah appears to us.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.680]   Like I said, out of nowhere, he brings up this prophet
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.440]   and speaks a word over the nation of Israel.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.520]   And the current king is a guy called Ahab.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.120]   And like some other kings before him,
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.360]   Ahab had allowed idol worship to run rampant.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   He had married a woman called Jezebel,
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.520]   and Jezebel was a worshiper of the god called Baal.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.640]   And Baal was known as an evil king,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.560]   one of these Canaanite, God, sorry,
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.280]   one of these Canaanite idols that enticed people
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.880]   to do bad and evil things.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.720]   She herself is so against God
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.800]   that she orders the prophets of Yahweh to be put to death.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.000]   All this to say it's not a good time
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.840]   to be a follower of God at this time.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.400]   And so when Elijah steps onto the scene,
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.120]   he has a strong and direct word to King Ahab.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.120]   This is a big deal.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.240]   It's sort of like a turning point.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.120]   It's hoping to be a turning point,
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.640]   once again, in the history of Israel.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.760]   Elijah comes up to the king and says,
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.160]   as the Lord God of Israel lives, like we said just now,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.320]   whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.920]   in the next few years except at my word.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.720]   Now again, like I said before, this sounds kind of harsh.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.040]   Right, you're gonna withhold rain,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.000]   you're gonna make there be a famine,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.680]   and there's gonna be a drought
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.000]   just because people aren't following you.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.640]   But in reality, this is a warning, there's a consequence.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.560]   The Israelites have already known
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.200]   about the consequences of idolatry.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.240]   Back when God was giving the law to the Israelites,
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.720]   he told them, this land that I'm bringing you into,
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.200]   this is the promised land.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.960]   It will be flowing with milk and honey.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.680]   There will be fruitful, there will be rain,
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.400]   the ground will produce grain,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.000]   there's gonna be wine and olive oil,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   all these things for you if you would love the Lord your God
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.400]   and serve him with your whole heart and with all your soul.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.080]   But if you do not, the warning was that
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.360]   God would shut up the heavens so that it will not rain
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.120]   and the ground would yield no produce.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.560]   Deuteronomy chapter 11,
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.520]   if you wanna check it out for yourself.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.040]   And as the Israelites are stuck in this cycle,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.760]   the theological term for this is apostasy.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.360]   Right, and under King Ahab, like we said,
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.240]   it's particularly bad, taking a liking to worshiping Baal.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.520]   And Baal was supposed to be the god of thunder, of lightning.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.600]   He was supposed to be the one in control over the weather.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.360]   Right, Baal was seen as the god of fertility.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.360]   He was supposed to be the god who provided for people
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.800]   through controlling the weather
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.280]   and being able to make the seasons come and go,
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.720]   making the land produce, all that kind of stuff.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.240]   That was supposed to be his role.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.080]   Now, we have to ask ourselves the question though, why?
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.280]   Why were the Israelites so into Baal worship?
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.800]   You would think after all that they'd been through,
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.080]   right, the way that God had brought them out of slavery,
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.040]   out of Egypt, into the promised land,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.080]   the different things that they had experienced
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.800]   and seen firsthand, the power of God at work,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.480]   the stories that had been passed down
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.680]   through the generations, right,
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.280]   they would have been a little bit more loyal to him.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.760]   The attractiveness of Baal worship
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.000]   laid in the fact that people could worship Baal
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.040]   on their own terms.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.120]   They could fulfill the desires, the dark, evil desires
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.880]   through worshiping Baal, right?
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.640]   Baal was an encourager of heavy drinking,
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.520]   of sexual license, the temple prostitutes,
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.280]   both male and female, were a very popular part
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.080]   of what it meant to worship Baal.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.520]   In other words, they could live in sin.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.880]   They could live in immorality.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.720]   They could do whatever they wanted
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.080]   and still call that worship.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.520]   This is the root of our adolatory church,
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.560]   when we put our own desires above
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.040]   how God has called us to live.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.360]   So as we're sitting here, we have to ask ourselves today,
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.560]   where are the idols in our lives?
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.920]   Where have we given up our knowledge of God
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.320]   and how he has called us to live
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.480]   just to satisfy our own wants and desires?
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.800]   And we might not be literally worshiping idols
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.880]   and images of Baal today, but if there's anything,
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.200]   anything at all that has taken your focus away from God
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.220]   and onto yourself and pleasing yourself,
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.680]   that is an idol, just like Baal was for the Israelites.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.120]   And some of us are in this time right now,
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.800]   we're facing dry seas in our life,
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.540]   wondering why we aren't seeing fruit and progress,
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:59.560]   knowing all the while that we haven't given our hearts
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.360]   wholly to God, that we've been following these idols
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.580]   instead of fixing and following in the footsteps of Jesus.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.900]   And so when Elijah pronounces this challenge,
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.600]   this statement, it wasn't just to King Ahab,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.560]   it was to Baal himself.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.260]   This was God was saying, you know what?
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.520]   I am the one, I am truly the one
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.040]   who's in charge of creation.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.620]   I'm the one who created the world in the first place.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.560]   You might think Baal has control over the weather,
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.420]   no, that's me.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.860]   I am the most high God.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.400]   I am the provider, I am the I am.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.420]   I am the creator and idols have no power over me.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.300]   I am the only and one true God.
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.120]   And it's a challenge for us and a reminder for us
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.920]   today as well.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.280]   If we want to see God work in our lives,
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.400]   if we want to bear fruit, if we want life,
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.660]   then we must put down our idols
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.540]   in order to follow God wholeheartedly.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.500]   And we're about to see through these encounters
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.520]   Elijah has with God, three main encounters.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.240]   Each encounter gets increasingly more dramatic
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.640]   and ends up with one of the most awesome displays
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.200]   of power that we see in the Old Testament,
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.000]   displays of his power and his presence.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.800]   All this to prove that there is only one God.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:28.040]   Even Elijah's name itself testifies to this fact.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.580]   Elijah means Yahweh is my God.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.320]   And I hope that this statement is one
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.860]   that we'll be able to walk away with today
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.460]   as we look at this passage, these passages together.
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.880]   So let's look at these encounters
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.120]   because I think they're gonna give us
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.040]   a really clear picture of who God is
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.020]   and why he is the only true God.
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:54.020]   First encounter involves a brook and some ravens.
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.260]   Let me explain.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.560]   So immediately after dropping the mic on a head,
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.480]   so to speak, and announcing this drought,
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.320]   Elijah is commanded to go and hide in a ravine.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.240]   And whilst he's in hiding, whilst he's in this ravine,
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.280]   God provides for him in a miraculous way.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.400]   You know, he's out in the wilderness
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.880]   and sort of like a homage, you know,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.440]   if you read through the Old Testament,
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.480]   you see these patterns of how God works, right?
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.640]   How God looked after his people in Israel,
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.000]   he continues to do the same for Elijah
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.360]   by feeding him in the desert,
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.320]   by providing him food and water,
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.380]   even though there's a drought and famine going on.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.640]   It's an amazing little story.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.800]   This is what God says.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.280]   "Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah,
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.800]   "leave here, turn eastward,
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.280]   "and hide in Kareth ravine, east of the Jordan.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.940]   "You will drink from the brook that I have directed
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.520]   "the ravens to supply you with food there.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.320]   "So he did what the Lord had told him.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.340]   "He went to the Kareth ravine, east of the Jordan,
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.780]   "and stayed there.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.000]   "The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.860]   "and meat and bread in the evening,
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.000]   "and he drank from the brook."
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.240]   So as we saw with the person of Joshua,
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.480]   Elijah has this spirit, has this mindset
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.980]   that is fixed on obeying God,
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.720]   to trust him at all times,
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.000]   even when it didn't make sense.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.680]   Go and hide in the desert?
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.780]   But how am I gonna survive?
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.720]   How am I gonna live?
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.080]   But notice, every time God asks for our obedience,
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.160]   he always shows us his power and ability to protect us
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.800]   and to provide for us and to guide us
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.680]   if we follow his guidance.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.400]   We see this in the middle of a drought.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.560]   Elijah, God leads Elijah to water.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.080]   When everyone is feeling the effects of famine,
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.060]   God brings meat and food to Elijah.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.160]   This is God displaying that in fact,
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.320]   he is the one in control over everything.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.960]   Over his creation, he provides these ravens
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.560]   to bring Elijah bread and meat twice a day.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.760]   This is a clear picture of God's rich providence.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.520]   You have to understand that back in that time,
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.200]   getting to eat meat twice a day was a rich fare,
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.400]   would have been a privilege even in the best of times.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.000]   And here, God is providing above and beyond.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.920]   All this to say, God will always unfailingly
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.800]   take care of those who rely on him.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.840]   And this is a word and a reminder for us.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.500]   Be confident, church, that if God has called you to it
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.280]   in his way, he will see you through
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.660]   if you trust and obey.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:37.600]   And we continue to see God work through Elijah in this way.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.680]   God then moves Elijah on to his next encounter.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.760]   We're told that the water in the brook dries up,
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.640]   so it's time to move on.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.820]   And God says to him, go at once to Zarephath
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.200]   in the region of Sidon and stay there.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.520]   I have directed a widow there to supply you with food.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.660]   So Elijah continues on his journey.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.320]   Like I said, this is a journey that Elijah's taken
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.380]   that's gonna culminate in this amazing encounter with God.
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.860]   This next step he has to take, though,
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.820]   is actually taking him directly into the heart
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.860]   of Baal's territory, of his home turf.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.900]   God is surely and slowly moving Elijah
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.980]   into a direct confrontation with Baal.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.480]   And so surely enough, Elijah gets to his destination
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.600]   and he meets a woman, a widow and her son, struggling on,
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.220]   struggling to survive through this drought and this famine.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.040]   And Elijah asks her for water and some food.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.280]   Now it's strange 'cause she's really in no position
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.320]   to help Elijah.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.040]   So she says to him, as surely as the Lord your God lives,
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   she replied, I don't have any bread,
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.960]   only a handful of flour in a jar
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.180]   and a little olive oil in a jug.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.320]   I'm gathering a few sticks to take home
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.700]   and make a meal for myself and my son
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.380]   that we may eat it and die.
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.400]   Notice her response.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.200]   This woman does not yet have a belief in God.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.520]   She acknowledges, she kind of knows who God is,
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.620]   she's probably heard stories about him,
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.160]   but she says, it's the Lord your God, Elijah,
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.940]   your God, not my God.
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.360]   She was probably a Baal worshiper herself.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.560]   But it seems as though she's already given up hope
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.840]   and she's waiting for death.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.360]   Her so-called God, who was supposed to look after her,
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.840]   who was supposed to be able to provide her with food
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.680]   and all these things, has failed.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.780]   And all is lost.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.480]   Life as she knows it at this moment is over.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.520]   And but this made me think,
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.400]   maybe for some of us here today,
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.280]   we're feeling a little bit like this woman.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.000]   And we're sitting here today, we've heard about God,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.680]   we've heard about who he is,
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.840]   but you would not say yet you had a relationship with God,
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.920]   even though you've heard about him.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.480]   And you might not literally be starving to death,
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.660]   but maybe in your spirit, in your outlook on life,
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.880]   in your hope, it's felt like you've been a season
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.320]   of drought and famine.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.720]   And the things that you've been putting your faith in
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.320]   have failed you.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.640]   And it feels like life has lost all meaning
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.320]   and there's really nothing else now to live for.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.620]   Maybe this is a word for you.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.520]   As these words of Elijah spoke to this widow
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.640]   brought her hope, I pray that if this is you today,
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.200]   you resonate with these words
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.360]   and it will bring you hope as well.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.680]   Elijah says to her, do not be afraid.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.240]   Do not be afraid.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.040]   This is the word of life.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.080]   He's about to tell her God's gonna take care of this.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.080]   So he says to her, this is what the Lord,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.100]   the God of Israel says.
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.440]   The jar of flour will not be used up
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.840]   and the jug of oil will not run dry
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.560]   until the day the Lord sends rain on the land.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.080]   And this is exactly what happens.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.500]   She thought she only had a little left, but God sustains it.
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.740]   The jar of flour does not get used up.
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.720]   The jug of oil does not run dry.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.080]   In keeping word with the words that are spoken by Elijah
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.940]   through the, sorry, through Elijah by the Lord.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:21.240]   If we're in a season today, church,
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.720]   where it feels like the hope, your hope has run dry,
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.800]   if you're in a season where you feel like you're done
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.540]   trusting in other things,
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:33.360]   maybe the answer for you today is to turn to God,
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.120]   to hear him say, do not be afraid,
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.900]   to hear him say, I will give you hope and life again.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.520]   You might feel like I've run out of bread.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:48.480]   The things that have been sustaining my life have run out.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.040]   But Jesus says, I am the bread of life.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.640]   You might think I only have a little handful left.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.480]   There's not much, I'm hanging on by a thread here.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:05.560]   But God says he will bring you to a place of abundance.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.640]   It may seem like there's only
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.120]   this tiny little bit of oil left
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.000]   and once I use it up, that's it.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.100]   I don't know what else I'm gonna hope in.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:17.480]   God says, put your trust in me and your cup will overflow.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:23.200]   God is the only one who's able to sustain your faith.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.600]   He's the only source where as long as you put your hope
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.680]   in him, your hope will never run dry.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   We see that even in the worst of times.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.240]   As we read on in this story, right,
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.680]   God provides for her son and for herself for a while,
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.480]   but things get worse.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.780]   Her son dies whilst Elijah is staying with them.
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.360]   But again, look how God wants to display his power.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.080]   Even in the face of death, God remains sovereign.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.640]   This is God really proving I am the true God.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.520]   I am the only God of life.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.120]   And this woman's son dies and she laments,
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.920]   why did you come here just to kill my son?
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.680]   And so Elijah again prays, oh my Lord,
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.280]   let this boy's life return to him.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.080]   And through Elijah's prayer,
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.480]   God brings the boy back to life.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.800]   And all this is going to show this is God's way
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.080]   of reaching this woman, of encountering this woman,
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.800]   to let her know that he is the true God.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.560]   And she declares it herself with her mouth,
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.360]   now I know that you are man of God
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.920]   and the word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.200]   Church, let me say this again.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.760]   If you feel as though hope in your life is lost today,
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.360]   if you feel that hope in your life even is dead today,
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.120]   if you want to know the true God
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.200]   who is the source of all life and all hope,
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.160]   cry out to him, call on him.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.200]   He is the only one who is able to give you life.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:00.280]   And so after helping out this widow and her son,
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.360]   making sure that they're gonna be okay and taken care of,
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.000]   finally now it's time for Elijah to go
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.840]   and confront the evil King Ahab face to face.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.320]   It's been a long time, the Bible told us,
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.080]   since they had last met.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.160]   After a long time, three years, in the third year,
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.320]   the word of the Lord came to Elijah.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.040]   Go and present yourself to Ahab
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.160]   and I will send rain on the land.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.240]   So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.320]   Now, a little bit more about Ahab.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.160]   It's clear by now to us, to the reader,
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.560]   if you've been reading through the story,
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.920]   that Ahab is not the kind of king,
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.520]   not the kind of leader that was fit
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.800]   to lead the people of God, to lead the nation of Israel.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.560]   If you read a little bit more in the passage 1 Kings 18,
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.280]   it tells us, yes, the land was in time
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.920]   of severe famine and drought,
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.760]   but instead of looking after his people,
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.440]   King Ahab is still more interested
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.200]   in looking after his own things.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.520]   Ahab orders people to go out and look for resources,
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.520]   but not because he wants to help his people.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.440]   He says, well, let's go out, look for grass,
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.040]   look for water, so that the horses and the mules
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.000]   will be kept alive and we don't have
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.580]   to kill any of our own animals.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.760]   Well, this is strange, right,
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.840]   'cause if Ahab was a good leader,
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.400]   he would have been out making sure
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.880]   that people like the people Elijah just helped,
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.520]   the widows and the orphans he had just encountered,
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.760]   will be taken care of.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.600]   This was the call of the Israelite king
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.160]   to look after the widows and the orphans.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.800]   But yet he's far more concerned
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.680]   and worried about his own possessions.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.280]   He is more interested in self-preservation.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.260]   Again, this just goes to prove, right,
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.840]   whatever we worship will end up dictating
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.160]   how we live our lives.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.720]   As Jesus put it, where our treasure is,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.460]   there your heart will be also.
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.520]   And I was reading this part,
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.160]   I felt like God was reminding me
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.840]   to ask ourselves a question,
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.360]   where are our priorities, excuse me?
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.080]   Where do our priorities lie?
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.360]   Do we have our hearts set on the things of God
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.600]   or on the things of man?
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.920]   Because whenever we're chasing idols
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.280]   and things that are not of God,
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.680]   our priorities are gonna be messed up.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.340]   And a good way to check to see
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.720]   if we're giving in to the idols in our lives
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.660]   is to look at our priorities.
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.560]   Right, we do a heart check and a mind check.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.160]   Ask ourselves the tough questions,
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.240]   what are we holding as important?
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.640]   Where do we find ourselves putting our resources,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.880]   our time, our money?
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.240]   What is our mind filled with?
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.680]   What are these goals that we're trying to hit?
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.360]   Because if they're not the things that are on God's heart,
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.080]   then maybe it's time for us to start making some changes.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:56.480]   Making, maybe it's time for us to realign our priorities,
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.780]   to make sure that our hearts are set aligned
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.200]   with what God has on his heart.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.560]   But Ahab is not able to see this.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.160]   Instead, when Elijah comes to him,
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.820]   he sees Elijah as, okay, here's someone
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.860]   that I can blame for all my problems.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:19.280]   As Ahab and Elijah meet, Ahab says to him,
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.980]   is that you, you troubler of Israel?
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.280]   Now I'm not sure, but have you ever been called
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.480]   a troublemaker?
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.520]   Well let me look at it, ask it this way.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.880]   When you hear the term troublemaker, who comes to mind?
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.080]   Don't look at them right now, okay?
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.920]   I mean, I can see a few, a corner of my eye right now.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.760]   Okay, I'm not gonna call you out, Justin, all right?
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.840]   But you know, I'm.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.640]   I used to be called a troublemaker a lot, actually,
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.720]   when I was, believe it or not, when I was at school.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.760]   One of the questions I would hate being asked,
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.440]   and I was asked almost, maybe not every day,
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.400]   but every other day, right?
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.800]   The teachers would say, "Hey, listen, tell me
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.400]   "what you've done wrong today.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.760]   "What trouble have you got into?"
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.440]   Right, and I never knew how to answer,
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.520]   because on any day, I've done multiple things wrong,
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.960]   all right, so I wouldn't wanna say something
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.240]   that the teacher didn't already know
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.560]   and get myself into even more trouble, right?
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.600]   Something they didn't already know about.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.660]   But Ahab, when Ahab calls Elijah a troublemaker,
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.660]   this was an accusation.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.520]   It was an insult.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.880]   Like I said, he was putting the blame on Elijah
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.160]   for the drought and the famine that they were facing.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.280]   This was Ahab's way of saying, "This is your fault, Elijah.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.880]   "You've gone and you've angered Baal,
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.600]   "and because you've angered Baal, this is why this famine,
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.240]   "this is why this drought is happening.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.800]   "This is why there's been no rain,
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.820]   "because you've insulted Baal."
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.000]   And again, this just shows how stubborn
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.640]   and how far away Ahab's heart had become from God,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.920]   how far away he had turned.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.220]   It's been three years that they've been facing this drought.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.600]   During any time in this three years, Ahab knew the law.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.320]   He knew why this was happening.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.840]   He could have repented at any moment.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.720]   He could have turned his heart back toward God.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.480]   He knew full well, I think, that this famine,
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.520]   this drought was due to the idol worship
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.920]   that he and he had led other people to participate in,
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.380]   and yet he refuses to repent and to change.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.860]   Instead, he tries to shift the blame onto Elijah.
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.200]   He points fingers.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.440]   This is easy thing to do, church,
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.580]   and it's also cowardly.
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:42.700]   People who are stuck in sin, who refuse to change,
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.800]   who refuse to take ownership, will always blame everyone
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.400]   and everything else but themselves.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.920]   But again, this just goes to show,
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.760]   for those of us who are obediently following God,
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.440]   if we're standing the light, if we're doing God's will,
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.360]   and if we're being called a troublemaker
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.580]   by those doing evil, you know you're doing something right.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:07.360]   The prophets were often called troublemakers, actually,
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.080]   not just Elijah, but the other prophets as well.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.160]   They were called troublemakers
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.680]   because they went against the status quo of the time.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.840]   They weren't afraid to speak the words of truth
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.500]   and call out sin in people.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.680]   They were called troublemakers
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.840]   because they asked the tough questions.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.600]   How are you looking after people?
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.520]   What are you doing to fulfill this role
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.560]   that God has given to you?
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.760]   They were called troublemakers
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.640]   because they revealed and spoke the truth.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.800]   The disciples were called troublemakers at one point
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.400]   because of their love for Jesus.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.360]   Paul and his friends were called troublemakers
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.640]   because they would not shut up about the gospel.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.200]   Even Jesus himself was being called a rebel and a subverter
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.580]   because he declared the truth about who he was.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:58.220]   In our fight against idolatry, in our fight against evil,
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.160]   we have to be ready, church.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.080]   Anytime we stand up against idolatry,
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.200]   anytime we stand up against injustice,
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200]   anytime we stand up to the principalities
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.720]   and power of this world,
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.860]   anytime we speak the truth over lies,
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.440]   we must be ready to be met with resistance
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.140]   and be labeled as troublemakers of this world.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.220]   But take heart.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.700]   We're not the troublemakers.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.420]   We're the ones who are calling people
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.860]   to turn their hearts back towards God.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:31.300]   And so at this point, God says, enough is enough.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.700]   I'm about to show you that actually,
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.900]   Ahab is the real troublemaker here.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.540]   And so Elijah challenged him to a showdown.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.420]   He says, Elijah says,
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.020]   I have not made trouble for Israel, Elijah replied,
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.340]   but you and your father's family have
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.340]   because you have abandoned the Lord's commands
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.460]   and have followed the Baals.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.860]   Now summon people from all over Israel
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.020]   and meet me on Mount Carmel
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.540]   and bring the 450 prophets of Baal
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:05.420]   and the 450 prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel's table.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.900]   So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.860]   and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:15.020]   This is like the fight of the century being set up here.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.900]   In Ahab's mind, he probably thought,
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:20.460]   well, okay, this is gonna be an easy victory for me.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:24.780]   900 prophets of idols, 900 prophets of Baal
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.220]   versus just one prophet of Yahweh.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:31.420]   On paper, this was not a fair fight.
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.740]   And to Ahab, this was an opportunity
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.900]   to shut this troublemaker up,
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.620]   to put this prophet of God to shame.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.380]   With the whole of Israel watching,
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.860]   I'm gonna humiliate Elijah before these assembled people.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.940]   He's gonna know that he's wrong
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.180]   and then we're gonna kill him.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.700]   That was probably the plan going on in his mind.
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.220]   But as we're about to see,
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.940]   there's gonna be a rude awakening for Ahab.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:03.020]   You see Elijah though, he's not fazed at all.
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.260]   He's not worried about the fact
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.100]   that he's going up against 900 of these prophets of Baal.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.620]   It's almost like he knows what's about to happen.
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.660]   And in the midst of all this,
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:14.940]   I don't want us to miss this, right,
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:19.180]   his main concern is still for God's people.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:22.940]   He has the heart of God towards his people.
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.620]   His main concern is a final warning for them
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.900]   to wake them up, to help them change
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.740]   their hearts and their minds.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.420]   Elijah went before the people and said,
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.460]   "How long will you waver between two opinions?
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.940]   "If the Lord is God, follow him.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.460]   "But if Baal is God, follow him."
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.700]   But the people said nothing.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.260]   It's a significant challenge
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.100]   that Elijah lays down to the people.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.780]   Again, as we've already mentioned, right,
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.420]   the main problem that Israel had
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.940]   was constantly slipping into apostasy.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.500]   Following God in one instance
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:01.260]   and then giving up on him in the next.
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.780]   And it's a pattern that, if we're honest with ourselves,
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.660]   maybe we find ourselves falling into today as well.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.340]   We know who God is, for those of us who do.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.260]   But at times, right, Baal worship,
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.180]   idol worship is still very enticing.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.860]   We have seen God work in our lives,
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.020]   but at times our hearts are still drawn
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.660]   towards these idols that we hold.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.660]   And Elijah's question to the Israelites
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.260]   still stands to us today.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.420]   How long will we waver?
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.460]   Because there's no such thing as being a Christian
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.940]   yet still putting our faith in things that are not of God.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.620]   We cannot claim to be a Christian
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.100]   but still find spirituality and spiritual hope
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:46.380]   in other sources like feng shui or tarot cards
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.940]   or horoscopes and things like that.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.140]   We cannot claim to be following Jesus
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.740]   but yet prioritize our business, our status,
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:58.700]   things of this world over how he has called us to live.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:03.820]   So Elijah tells them, you have to get off the fence.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.500]   Make up your mind.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.140]   Other parts of the Bible says this,
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.100]   no one can be a slave of two masters.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.380]   Jesus tells us if we're not for him,
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.580]   then we're against him.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.940]   Revelation 3:16 says, so because you are lukewarm,
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:25.460]   neither hot or cold, I'm about to spit you out of my mouth.
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:30.780]   But the people said nothing.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:36.260]   Church, let's not be a people who say nothing.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:41.060]   God is not looking for a church that is silent.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.980]   God is not looking for those whose faith tosses and turns.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.500]   God is not looking for people whose faith is hidden
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.500]   while there's injustice in this world,
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.620]   whilst there are still people
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.100]   who don't know the love of Jesus.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.580]   And I pray as this body of Christ, as this community,
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.900]   we will never be a people that stay silent,
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.100]   that we will never be a church that is afraid
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.740]   to cause trouble for the evildoers of this world.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.340]   And I pray that as a church, we'll be loud and bold
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.020]   and active in our faith,
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.420]   because we know that the God we serve
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:16.340]   is the most high or powerful God.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.980]   And we're about to see Elijah prove it.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:23.540]   Elijah said to them, I am only one of the Lord's prophets
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:27.460]   left, but Baal has 450 prophets.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.100]   Get two bulls for us.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.220]   Let Baal's prophets choose one for themselves
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.020]   and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood,
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.940]   but not set fire to it.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.220]   I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood,
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.980]   but not set fire to it.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.020]   Then you call upon the name of your God,
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.020]   and I will call the name of the Lord.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:47.940]   The God who answers by fire, he is God.
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.060]   Then all the people said, what you say is good.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.740]   Elijah said to the prophets of Baal,
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.020]   choose one of the bulls and prepare it first,
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.980]   since there are so many of you.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.380]   Call upon the name of your God, but do not light the fire.
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:04.140]   So they took the bull given them and prepared it.
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.180]   Then they called upon the name of Baal
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.740]   from morning until noon.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.180]   Baal, answer us, they shouted.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:17.460]   Things are made as hard for Yahweh as possible.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.460]   Elijah is one against 400.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.380]   Baal's people get the first choice of the bull.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.620]   The whole thing is set up to try and tip the scales
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.060]   against Elijah.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.700]   And the Baals, they make the first move,
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.940]   so it's like if you're playing a game of badminton
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.780]   or tennis or something, right?
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.740]   If you serve first, it's always your advantage, right?
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.340]   So all the advantage was given to the prophets
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.900]   and the worshipers of Baal.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.220]   Everything was done to tip the balance against them,
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.100]   to make this not into a fair fight.
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.580]   But check this out.
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:50.940]   There was no response.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.660]   No one answered.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:58.420]   And they danced around at the altar they had made.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.340]   At noon, Elijah began to taunt them.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.100]   Shout louder, he said.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.180]   Surely he's God.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.020]   Maybe he's in deep thought or busy or traveling.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:10.180]   Some translation says maybe he's on the toilet, right?
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.820]   Maybe he's sleeping and must be awakened.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.940]   They shouted louder and slashed themselves
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.940]   with swords and spears as was their custom
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.860]   until their blood flowed.
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.060]   Midday passed and they continued their frantic prophesying
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.180]   until the time of evening sacrifice,
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.780]   but there was no response.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:26.940]   No one answered.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.500]   No one paid attention.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.780]   How ironic.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.740]   Now if Baal worship wasn't such an evil practice,
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.580]   you would almost feel sorry for them
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.500]   as what's happening here.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.740]   They tried to humiliate Elijah,
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.420]   but they're the ones being humiliated right now.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.660]   I mean, these prophets put up every trick in the book.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:49.780]   All these tactics were things that were supposed to entice
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.380]   a reaction from Baal.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.100]   The self-mutilation, the frantic prophesying
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:59.100]   were supposed to be tactics to get Baal's attention.
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.420]   But in the end, it's absolutely useless.
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.900]   But this made me think.
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.100]   In the same way for us,
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.940]   the efforts that we put into pleasing and chasing our idols,
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.540]   all the effort we put into the things of this world
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.620]   will always amount to nothing.
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.780]   This is why every time we chase idols,
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.620]   we always end up feeling empty inside.
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.060]   It never works.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.620]   This is why the things of this world will never satisfy us.
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.620]   No matter how much of it we have,
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.380]   we always want more of it.
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.940]   We're never satisfied.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:37.380]   So why are we running around, making so much effort,
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.460]   in some cases even hurting ourselves,
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.780]   to try and please these idols,
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.820]   to try and get much of these things we can
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.780]   to things that will never really be able to respond
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.540]   and to satisfy us?
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.020]   The things of this world, church, will never satisfy.
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:55.500]   They will never be able to answer our prayers.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.220]   Contrast this to Elijah's response.
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:04.140]   He repairs the altar, he arranges the wood,
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.900]   he puts his sacrifice, drenches the whole thing in water.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:11.420]   We're taught it's drenched in water, and he says a prayer.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:17.460]   Elijah says, "Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:21.740]   "let it be known today that you are God in Israel
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.580]   "and that I am your servant
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.700]   "and have done all these things at your command.
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.260]   "Answer me, Lord.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.180]   "Answer me so that these people will know
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.260]   "that you, God, are God,
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.620]   "and that you are turning their hearts back again."
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:41.020]   It's a soft prayer compared to the franticness
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.380]   of the prophets of Baal.
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:46.180]   But there's a really beautiful thing about this prayer
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:50.900]   that really reveals Elijah's pastoral heart
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.820]   and God's heart for his people.
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:57.180]   Because yet, yes, he is frustrated
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.860]   that people have turned to idol worship.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.380]   The double-mindedness of these people
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.900]   has gone against the will of God.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.500]   But notice the prayer.
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.540]   The prayer is not yet, "Punish these people.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.020]   "Kill them right now, God.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.060]   "They deserve death.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.420]   "Look how they've turned away from you."
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.540]   That's not what Elijah says.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.540]   Rather, it's for them to have their eyes opened,
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.980]   to have their hearts restored.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.500]   Let them know you are God
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.860]   so they can turn their hearts back to you.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.500]   Like I said in the beginning,
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.420]   this is always God's heart for his people,
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.580]   for them to be back to him again,
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.140]   for them to be back close to him
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.460]   so that he can love on them
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.820]   and he can provide for them and take care of them
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.300]   in the best way that he knows how.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.940]   God responds so that his children
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.500]   will turn their hearts back to him.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:53.500]   God responds in a way for everyone to see who he is.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.540]   And when God responds, there is no hoax.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.740]   There is no deception.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:05.540]   It's a powerful and direct answer,
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.220]   a true display of his power.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:14.420]   Then the fire of the Lord fell and burned up the sacrifice,
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.660]   the wood, the stones, the soil.
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.260]   Think about how powerful that fire would have to be
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:24.260]   to burn up stones, to lick up the water in the trench.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:28.420]   When the people saw this, they felt prostrate and cried,
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:32.540]   the Lord, he is God, the Lord, he is God.
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.860]   The story ends with a powerful
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.660]   and dramatic encounter with God,
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:42.260]   through God's fire, the all-consuming fire,
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.300]   the holy fire, the fire that leaves people
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.820]   with no doubt that God is the only true God.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.220]   The fire that leaves people with no choice
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.380]   but to bow down and worship him.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:45:00.140]   Church, we spent the past few weeks in this series
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.580]   talking about wanting to encounter God.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.700]   But if we really want a true encounter with God
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.740]   that's gonna be lasting and changes our lives
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:12.100]   and changes our hearts, we have to get rid
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.900]   of the idols in our lives, church.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:18.620]   We have to get away everything that's distracted us
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.660]   from him, who he's called us to be,
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.100]   how he's called us to live, so that him and him alone
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.300]   sits at the highest priority out of everything
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.500]   that we live for.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:33.540]   So we're gonna take a moment right now, church, to pray.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.420]   And I'm gonna pray and ask God to show us
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.180]   where the idols in our lives might be.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:44.860]   And it might be a scary thing to do,
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.300]   but I'm gonna ask also for God to come
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:51.220]   and to burn away everything else that doesn't belong
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:55.180]   in our hearts and our minds, to remove these idols
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.180]   that we might have turned our heart towards.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.420]   And we'll find that God's heart is one of mercy
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.860]   and grace and love.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:06.220]   He's not seeking to punish us, but he's seeking
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:09.500]   for to turn our hearts back towards him
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.060]   because that's the best place for us to be.
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:18.140]   So get yourselves comfortable in whatever way
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:21.020]   you normally talk to God, church.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.180]   Maybe you wanna close your eyes if that helps you focus
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.340]   or something like that.
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:29.780]   And just do a bit of a heart check right now.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:35.340]   Have there been things that have taken priority
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.580]   over God in your lives?
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:40.020]   Have there been things that you've turned to
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:44.260]   for your source of hope and life instead of Jesus?
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.660]   [soft music]
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.940]   It's a deep question.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.300]   Sometimes these things are kind of subtle.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:47:00.740]   But as you pray, just allow the Holy Spirit
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.980]   to bring them up.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.380]   [soft music]
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:21.260]   And one thing that as I was thinking between these services
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.380]   and talking to someone, one of the things
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.740]   that we so often fall victim to as an idol
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.620]   in our society is the praise of man.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.540]   [soft music]
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:37.140]   And we start, we wanna do things and perform
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:43.900]   and reach certain goals because we want other people
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.460]   to see, oh yeah, that person is good, that person is great.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:51.380]   Or we're trying to please other people's expectations.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:05.140]   Jesus reminds us, my opinion of you is the most important.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:13.340]   That's more important to please God rather than man.
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:22.700]   Whatever it is, church, just continue to allow God
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:24.140]   to speak to you about it.
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:30.340]   And when he does, just confess it to him
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.660]   and tell him about it.
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.900]   And then just imagine that fire like Elijah came,
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:40.900]   come down and burn it away, God's holiness, God's presence.
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:47.700]   And for him to turn your heart back towards him again.
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:51.820]   So Father, we pray for our hearts, we pray for our minds.
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.980]   Burn everything else away till there's a pure
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.340]   and true desire just for you and you alone.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.060]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.580]   [soft music]
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:08.160]   (gentle music)
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
