[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   My name, if you don't know, is Andrew George Gardner.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   Andrew George Gardner.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.520]   I can't believe I've just told you my middle name, okay?
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.680]   Andrew was my father's middle name.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.600]   George was his father's first name.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.360]   My name is not random.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.600]   My name is not arbitrary, it wasn't just something that came up.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.360]   My parents just didn't think they were nice-sounding words.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.120]   My name has a meaning.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.600]   It links me to the generations of the men in my family.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.240]   As I walk forward with my name, I carry the character
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.680]   and the lives and the legacy of my late father and his late father.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.720]   And I'm proud of the name that I hold.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.640]   One of the problems with my name, though, is that Andrew means "strong and manly,"
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.520]   so I don't know where my parents got that one from, but...
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.080]   But names matter.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.160]   Names actually carry something in them.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.280]   I don't know if you've ever stopped to think about your name or what your name carries.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.040]   Every single person in this room, your name has a story to it.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.840]   And if you don't know the story of your name, I want to invite you this week,
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.240]   some homework to do, to find the story behind your name.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.520]   I know within the Asian culture, for example, that your name is not random at all.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.320]   Your name came from many, many months of lots of conversation and discussion
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.720]   amongst all your relatives, deciding what you should be under a certain lunar new year
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.520]   and a certain kind of thing, wanting to describe something that was audacious and beautiful,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.560]   written in both Chinese and spoken aloud, so that your name means something.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.560]   Are you with me?
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.320]   Names matter.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.800]   If you were to read my name, Andrew George Gardner, you didn't know anything about me.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.960]   You would know that I'm not Italian.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.240]   Right?
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.440]   You would know I'm not Chinese.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.960]   You would know that I'm not French.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.440]   I mean, there is nothing more English than Andrew George Gardner.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.480]   I mean, you can't even say it without trying to pretend you're English.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.720]   Andrew George Gardner is like the kind of way in which you should say my name.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.640]   There's an old Chinese proverb that says this,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.440]   it says, "The beginning of all wisdom is to call things by their right name."
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.640]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.400]   The beginning of all wisdom is to make sure that you're naming things right,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.240]   that you're describing something with the words in which you're giving it,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.280]   because your words matter, and names have the power to shape a story.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.440]   I was reminded of this just a few years ago
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.600]   when my wife and I were in Thailand in Chiang Mai,
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.320]   and as we're in Chiang Mai, we were invited by an NGO
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.160]   to come to a grand dinner that they were putting on,
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.880]   one of those dinners where you have to dress up and be real smart,
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.920]   and where they put name tags on every chair
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.600]   so that you know exactly where you're to sit.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.400]   And I show up to my table, and there's my name tag,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.920]   and right next to it is somebody else's name tag,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.640]   and when I read that name, fear came over me.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.320]   Let me show you, I took a photo of it.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.360]   Here was the photo.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.960]   So there on the right is boring old Andrew Gardner,
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.000]   and on the left, the name tag read, "HRH Prince Michael."
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.480]   I have no idea who this is,
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.120]   but this man is so important, he doesn't need a last name.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.640]   HRH means "His Royal Highness."
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.960]   Prince means that he's a son of a duke.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.120]   I knew that he was obviously royalty,
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.680]   but I didn't know anything about what kind of royalty this was,
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.840]   which is really embarrassing because I'm English,
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.520]   and he's a part of the English royal family, OK?
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.480]   But I grew up most of my time in Hong Kong,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.280]   like I'm a pretty poor subject when it comes to being English, right?
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.840]   So he shows up, I don't know what to do.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.240]   Do I shake his hand? Do I bow?
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.960]   So I do a shake bow.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.040]   (Laughter)
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.000]   Because I figured I got both covered if I do the shake bow.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.640]   I could tell that he was used to people doing the shake bow.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.560]   He was very gracious to me.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.760]   Turns out that His Royal Highness Prince Michael of Kent
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.720]   is actually the cousin of our late queen,
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.840]   if you're British here, the cousin of your late queen.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.520]   Now, here's the interesting thing.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.440]   I was very honest with him up front.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.840]   I'm like, "Hey, I grew up in Hong Kong.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.760]   I'm English, but I don't know much about royalty.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.840]   Could you tell me about your family?"
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.720]   Oh, you should have seen his eyes.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.400]   His eyes just lit up.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.600]   And he started to tell me all about his family
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   and how his family was carried and the importance of his name.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.040]   He had just been at a wedding.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   Do you know what wedding he'd just been at?
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.960]   Catherine and William's wedding.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.520]   He gave me all the inside goss about that wedding.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.360]   It was awesome!
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.000]   He was telling me these amazing facts about being royal.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.120]   He actually told me a story.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.800]   He said this.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.720]   He said, "You wouldn't know this, but," he said,
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.920]   "every member of my family, including myself,
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.240]   have all been married in the same church for generations.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.240]   In fact, it goes all the way back to the 15th century,
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.920]   married in the same church since the 15th century."
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.120]   To which I replied, "I got married in a chapel in Las Vegas
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.920]   that dates back to the '70s."
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   He didn't find that funny.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.640]   It was a joke, but he didn't find it funny at all.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.920]   We had the most amazing night, but it reminded me
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.280]   of something that I think is so central to our scriptures.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.760]   And that's this, that names matter.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.720]   That names hold character and nature and story and destiny.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.720]   That names that are used in scripture are not random.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.880]   In fact, here's a biblical interpretation technique
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.680]   for every single one of you here.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.720]   And it's this, anytime you come across a name in scripture,
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.920]   you should stop and ask yourself,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.880]   what does this name mean?
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.040]   Because the Bible writers don't throw names in there,
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.720]   whether it's the name of a village or a name of a person.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.960]   By random, they want you to understand something
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.120]   about who they are based on their name.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.800]   Jesus was in the habit of naming things by their right name.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.760]   And if somebody didn't have the right name,
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.400]   he would change it on the spot.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.760]   How weird would that be?
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.680]   Imagine if I did that with you.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.800]   Oh, hi, your name's Frank.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.640]   Nice to meet you.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.000]   I'm gonna call you John.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.320]   He would go up to Simon and say,
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.320]   "Hey, Simon, nice to meet you.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.480]   "You're now gonna be called Peter,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.400]   "because on this rock," Peter means rock,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.160]   "I'm going to build my church."
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.960]   Jesus was in the habit of making sure
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.800]   that people understood the name that was within them
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.320]   and what that name meant.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.000]   And what you see throughout scripture
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.600]   is that there's power in a name.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.520]   Now, what you've also got to understand
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.400]   and what we see in scripture and we see in our humanity
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.200]   is the reality that names can not only shape us for good,
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.760]   they can also shape us for bad.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.840]   In fact, that there's for all of us,
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.440]   names that we carry around that begin to form
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.360]   and shape inside of us,
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.000]   that don't actually release us
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.960]   into a wonderful new trajectory of God or life,
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.320]   but actually names that hold us back
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.680]   and that speak into us
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.800]   and begin to form and shape something in us.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.680]   We all need to realize that actually,
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.840]   so often words spoken over us
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.760]   might seem just kind of normal and surface,
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.160]   but when they're spoken over us,
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.000]   they have the power to come down
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.960]   and actually form and shape within us our core beliefs.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.320]   And so often the actual names
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.000]   that you carry around with you,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.760]   not talking about your legal name,
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.760]   I'm talking about the names
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.560]   that you say over yourself inside of you
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.360]   are formed by other people's perspectives
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.280]   and opinions about you.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.640]   And when people speak over you
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.360]   with their perspectives and their opinions,
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.080]   when they try to say something to you,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.520]   when they try to form and shape your narrative,
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.960]   we often take those words,
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.600]   particularly if they're spoken over somebody
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.360]   in authority of our lives,
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.560]   a teacher or dare I say a pastor,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.080]   or a loved one or a friend or a family member,
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.000]   but these words are spoken,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.600]   we take them down and they begin to shape these names
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   that so often are destructive rather than releasing.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.320]   Give me an example of some.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.080]   When somebody says things like this over you,
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.800]   "Hey, I know you mean well,
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.200]   "but you're not actually really that smart."
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.520]   Or what about if someone says,
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.480]   "Hey, I think if you lost a little bit of weight,
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.280]   "somebody might actually like you."
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.560]   What about a word like,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.120]   "Hey, you did your best,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.400]   "but there are just other people who are better than you."
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.360]   Or how about this,
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.880]   "I wish you could be more like your sister."
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.440]   You will always be deserted.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.720]   Everyone is going to desert you.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.440]   People say phrases like this and speak stuff over us,
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.760]   and perhaps people have spoken stuff like this over you,
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.400]   and they go down and they begin to shape
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.520]   and form something in us.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.760]   And what we do with the words people say
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.840]   is that we create names and we begin to label ourselves.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.040]   We begin to speak about things in our inner being.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.120]   So the idea of, "Hey, you're not very smart,"
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.760]   gets internalized like this, "I am an idiot."
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.040]   If somebody says over you,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.760]   "Hey, you should lose a little bit of weight."
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.800]   "I am unattractive."
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.920]   Somebody says over you,
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.360]   "Hey, there are other people better than you."
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.040]   "I am inadequate."
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.560]   "You should be more like your sister."
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.280]   "I'm a failure."
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.440]   Everyone's going to desert you.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.080]   "I'm alone."
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.600]   Look at this, idiot, unattractive, inadequate, failure, alone.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   And these become the names that we begin to name ourselves.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.480]   And we got to understand
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.880]   that what we name ourselves has power.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.680]   What we name ourselves begins to shape and structure
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.560]   our trajectory and our future.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.800]   It begins to actually form and shape our opinions
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.000]   about ourselves and about the world.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.400]   And those names that we carry deep inside of us
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.800]   begin to actually come out in our decisions,
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.640]   come out in the things we say,
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.120]   come out in how we begin to think and label ourselves.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.080]   And we begin to walk in a way
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.200]   that is way not the way God wants us to walk.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.880]   And I want to point this out to you
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.920]   because I think this is actually
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.040]   one of the most important strategies
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.560]   that the enemy has against God's people.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.480]   Because if the enemy can do anything,
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.360]   it's that he wants you to think of yourself
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.480]   less than how God thinks of you.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.320]   He wants you to label yourself in a way
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.760]   that God would never label you.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.880]   And he wants you to do that
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.160]   because he knows that if he can get you to feel that way,
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.040]   he's gonna stop the trajectory of your life in Christ Jesus.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.120]   And if Satan wants anything, he wants a defeated church.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.880]   And when this stuff happens in us,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.880]   I have a phrase for it in the spirit.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.880]   It's this idea of the slavery of the soul.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.960]   And if you're anything like me here today,
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.680]   you're wrestling somewhat with the slavery of the soul
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.600]   by the names that you have come to label yourself.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:08.400]   The greatest struggle that I think we have as human beings
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.360]   is this struggle between this difference
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.920]   that is inside of us,
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.360]   a difference that actually chains us to bondage
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.600]   and slavery in our inner person.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.780]   And that difference is this.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.600]   The difference between who we really are
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.840]   and who we've come to believe we are.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.520]   That difference will tear you apart.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.760]   So many of us get lost
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.080]   between who we really are in Christ Jesus
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.080]   and who we've come to believe we are in our brokenness.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.120]   Every single one of us in this room,
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.240]   every single one of us has come to believe
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.440]   that you are less than how Jesus sees you to be.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.260]   Every single one of us.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.660]   That's the work of the enemy.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.140]   Now, I wanna say something right up front here
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.520]   that I believe will be encouragement to you.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.460]   Every single one of us in this room
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.280]   is a broken and complicated person.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.260]   And here's the good news.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.900]   The Bible is full of broken and complicated people.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.560]   In fact, I would actually say it like this.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.280]   God actually targets broken and complicated people
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.800]   to use them for His glory, His purposes, and His promises.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.120]   God actually has a habit
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.800]   of trying to find the most broken and complicated people
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.720]   and saying, "I can use these ones to bring my purposes
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.680]   "and my promises, my redemption, my salvation in the world."
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.820]   I mean, you just need to scan through the pages of the Bible
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.580]   to see how God targets people like this.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.080]   Noah, called by God to actually be a deliverer of humanity
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.800]   by building an ark, was a drunk.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.280]   Abraham, called by God to leave his family
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.080]   and start a new family that would become the nation of Israel
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.540]   was a habitual liar.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.960]   Moses, called by God to go and deliver his people
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.480]   out of slavery in the broken Egypt
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.760]   and take them into the Promised Land, he was a murderer.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.100]   David, who the Bible describes was after God's own heart,
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.780]   was an adulterer and a murderer.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.060]   Peter, who God comes and says,
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.680]   "You're gonna be the one who would build my church,"
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.520]   Peter was a betrayer of his best friend.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.260]   And the hard thing was his best friend was Jesus.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:29.700]   God is in the habit of taking broken and hurting people
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.160]   and complicated people
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.760]   and doing amazing things through them.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.520]   And if you're feeling somewhat broken
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.000]   and complicated in the room today,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.600]   well, that's good news for you.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.160]   Your complication doesn't disqualify you
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.560]   from God's ordination.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.480]   Come on, church, I know you're here somewhere.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.780]   Your complication does not disqualify you
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.480]   from God's ordination, from God's using you
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.280]   and His purposes and His promises in this world.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   Your brokenness and your complications
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.120]   is not an issue for God.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.400]   What it is, is an issue for you,
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.040]   an issue for me.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.640]   See, God's not put off by my brokenness
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.960]   and my complications, but I am.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.440]   I'm the one who struggles in that brokenness.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.640]   I'm the one who's come to allow that brokenness
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.400]   to define me more than how God defines me.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.580]   I'm the one who's been under the struggle
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.360]   of some of those names that have come inside of me
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.400]   that have formed and shaped me into the man that I am today.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.640]   Oh, it's not a problem to God
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.900]   because He looks down at me and He says,
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.560]   "This is my son whom I love.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.960]   With him, I am well pleased."
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.200]   I'm the one who says, "I don't love.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.280]   I'm not pleased.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.280]   I'm broken.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.280]   I'm a failure."
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.000]   Are you with me?
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.380]   The names that you carry have great power over you.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:53.160]   And this is exactly what was happening for Israel.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.240]   In this section of scripture
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.920]   that we've been looking at during this whole series,
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.680]   Isaiah 40 to 66,
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.480]   what was happening for Israel was that they were in a place
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.200]   where they had come to believe these new names
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.880]   that they were calling themselves
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.000]   out of their brokenness and hurt.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.760]   I mean, 70 years in exile had been a tough time.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.040]   And God had shown up now and said,
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.480]   "Hey, I'm doing a new thing.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.240]   Will you not perceive it?"
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.640]   And the problem for Israel was
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.320]   that they were struggling to perceive it.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.880]   They were struggling to see the new thing
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.120]   because they were actually on a trajectory
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.880]   of embracing the brokenness that was inside of them.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.200]   They were allowing that to form and shape
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.840]   how they thought about their identity,
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.400]   how they thought about their nature,
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.160]   and how they thought about their future.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.280]   So when God turns up and says, "I'm doing a new thing,"
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.920]   Israel were kind of like, "Yeah, but not us."
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.000]   In fact, if you look at this passage from 40 to 66,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.120]   you get a sense of where Israel were.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.320]   They were angry at God.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.000]   They were upset at Him.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.880]   They had seen their city destroyed
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.800]   and their temple pulled down.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.600]   And they were wondering, where was God?
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.080]   They felt abandoned by God.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.520]   They felt like He had left them alone,
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.640]   given up on them, turned His back on them.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.480]   And in that place of abandonment,
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.080]   they felt dried up inside.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.120]   They felt like it was over for them.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.320]   They felt their future was bleak.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.520]   This is really important to know,
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.320]   that the names that we give ourselves
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.600]   have the power to determine our destiny.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.360]   And here's Israel going, "I've been abandoned.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.040]   "I'm an orphan.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.840]   "I've got no future.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.360]   "There's no good thing for me ahead of me at all."
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.220]   And they're in this trajectory towards a destiny
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.800]   that was not God's destiny.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.960]   And He shows up and says, "I've got a new thing for you.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.320]   "I'm doing a new thing.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.480]   "Can you perceive it?"
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.840]   And He's like, "There's no way they're gonna perceive it
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.360]   "because they're allowing the names inside of them
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.480]   "to determine where they're heading."
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:52.840]   God says, "Let me speak to you again.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.840]   "Some of you in this room,
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.480]   "some of you watching online right now,
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.160]   "it's been years that you've been carrying around a name
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.320]   "that you've been given yourself,
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.940]   "that you have formed in yourself.
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.880]   "I'm a failure.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.920]   "No one's gonna love me.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.400]   "I can't attract anyone, whatever it might be.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.100]   "And you've been carrying that around for years.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.260]   "And for years, that has been determining your decisions.
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:26.320]   "And I'm here today to liberate you from years
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.080]   "of what the enemy has done in you
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.280]   "because you are not the sum total
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.360]   "of the worst thing you have done.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.920]   "You are not the name
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.100]   "that you are currently holding in your heart.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.720]   "There's a new name for you."
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.960]   And I wonder whether we would open our hearts today
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.680]   to hear what it is that the Lord wants to say
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.600]   to so many of us
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.560]   who know that there is a difference
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.920]   between who God says I am
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.200]   to who I have come to believe I am
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.720]   through my brokenness and my complications.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.560]   Are you with me?
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:09.300]   I wanna show you how God does this for Israel.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.120]   In chapter of 62,
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.480]   in this incredible section of scripture in Isaiah,
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.720]   he says this,
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.980]   "For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.760]   "For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.540]   "till her righteousness shines out like the dawn,
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.380]   "her salvation like a blazing torch.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.880]   "I want you to hear right up front
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.520]   "the passion that God has in this moment for his people.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.000]   "He knows that they're on a trajectory of a destiny
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.220]   "that he doesn't have for them.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.160]   "He's stepping in to change how they perceive themselves.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.320]   "And he starts by saying,
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.340]   "I see what's going on in your life
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.660]   "and I will not remain silent.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.840]   "I haven't given up on you.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.960]   "I'm not distant from you.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.680]   "I see it, I care about it.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.120]   "I will not remain quiet.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.500]   "I will not remain silent
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.160]   "because I have a new destiny for you,
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.680]   "a new future for you,
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.820]   "where it's like salvation, like a blazing torch.
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.660]   "It's like the nations glorifying me through you.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.200]   "I see all of this stuff in your future
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.100]   "and I'm not gonna remain silent
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.300]   "of the fact that you're not on that trajectory.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.800]   "I care for you.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.420]   "I love you.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.980]   "I'm here for you."
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.660]   One of the things you could do is take that passage
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.220]   and put your name in it.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.980]   For Sydney's sake, I will not keep silent.
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.540]   For Sydney's sake, I will not remain quiet
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.780]   till his righteousness shines out like the dawn
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.880]   and his salvation like a blazing torch.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.360]   For Andrew's sake, I'm not gonna remain silent
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.240]   until those names that he has put inside of him,
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.160]   the names that have been spoken over him,
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.160]   which is causing him to live out an identity
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.520]   that is not Christ, until that is changed,
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.100]   I will not remain silent.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.760]   You need to know that the Lord wants to liberate you
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.520]   from any of these names that you're holding.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.960]   Notice what he says next in verse two and three.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.640]   He says, "The nations will see your righteousness
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.840]   "and all the kings your glory,
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.700]   "and you will be called by a new name
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.980]   "that the mouth of the Lord will bestow.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.660]   "You will be a crown of splendor in the Lord's hand,
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.620]   "a crown or a royal diadem in the hand of your God."
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.460]   I love this moment.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.660]   He says, "There's a new name for you.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.840]   "I see the old names that are tearing you apart.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.720]   "I see the difference that is in you
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.300]   "between who you really are
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.380]   "and who you've come to believe you are
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.420]   "through the broken names that you've adopted
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.360]   "and that you've taken onto your nature.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.780]   "I see that I have a new name for you,
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.680]   "and it's a name that you need to hear
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.600]   "because that name is going to change something,
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.720]   "shift something, turn something in your life.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.780]   "That name is gonna move your destiny
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.560]   "from one thing to the next.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.900]   "I've got something on my heart for you.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.560]   "I know you intimately.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.380]   "I wanna come and change what it is
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.000]   "that's happening in your life right now.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.780]   "I see what the enemy has done, and it moves my heart.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.580]   "Hear my voice, let me speak.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.300]   "I've got a new name for you."
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.260]   And notice what he says here,
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.500]   'cause I think this is so key.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.880]   He says, "I've got a new name for you
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.900]   "that the mouth of the Lord will bestow."
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.040]   Why is that important?
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.660]   It's important because the majority of names
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.860]   that we have, that we embrace,
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.640]   are names put there from the mouths of others.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.900]   Names put there from the mouths of those around us.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.820]   Maybe my ex-spouse said some things that caused me to,
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.180]   (groans)
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.060]   and believe some things about me that are a lie.
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.860]   Maybe that colleague or that boss pulled me down
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.300]   because they wanted to get the promotion.
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.780]   And that name, that thing they said about me,
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.840]   oh, I've begun to believe it.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.780]   The names that will be destructive in your life
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:37.620]   will come always from some other voice other than God.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.340]   And when God looks upon you and says,
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.660]   "We're gonna change something here,"
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.820]   it's his mouth, it's his voice.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.220]   Not a voice from anyone else,
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.660]   not a voice from your pastor,
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.980]   not a voice from the preacher,
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.380]   not a voice from a good friend.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.860]   It's gonna be the voice of God
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.660]   that is gonna change it for you.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.780]   (congregation applauding)
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.340]   It's gonna be his voice
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.020]   that will shift something in your life.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.380]   And I love the fact that you come to the Vine
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.420]   and listen to me and the other pastors preach,
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.400]   and we hope we share things that'll help you,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.860]   but it is God's voice that will change you, not mine.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.980]   It's his mouth that speaks.
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.340]   And my prayer for you today,
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.540]   both in this time now and in the week ahead,
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.220]   is that you will hear the voice of God
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.740]   speak a new name over you
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.540]   that will change everything for you.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.140]   Notice what he says next, verse four.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:44.300]   I love what God does here.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.700]   He starts out by saying,
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.540]   "Let me name to you the names
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.140]   that are currently inside you.
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.180]   Let me speak out about how you've named yourself.
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.460]   Here's how you've called yourself, Israel.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.660]   You've called yourself abandoned and desolate."
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.300]   God is really clear
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.860]   that he wants them to understand where they are,
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.220]   that they feel that way,
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.900]   abandoned by God and desolate.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.460]   And I think those two names, abandoned and desolate,
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.820]   are not just for Israel,
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.100]   but I think they sum up all of the strategy
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.700]   of the enemy to hold us back
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.300]   from the person that we truly are.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.060]   If the enemy wants you to have anything,
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.140]   it's for you to feel alone.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.060]   It's for you to feel abandoned,
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.260]   abandoned by your friends,
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.580]   abandoned by your church,
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.500]   abandoned by God.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.940]   And when we are abandoned,
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.340]   when we feel like we are alone,
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.940]   we dry up inside.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.060]   The word desolate there,
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.940]   speaking about like a desert that's dry inside.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.540]   We dry up, the joy is gone,
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.340]   the life and vitality is gone.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.060]   We think we're no good to anybody.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.860]   We think we've got nothing to offer this world.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.420]   If we are abandoned,
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.540]   we find ourselves without joy.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.580]   When we're abandoned or deserted or given up on,
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.060]   it dries us out inside.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.300]   And God is very specific here
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.140]   because he wants Israel not to be shamed.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.300]   God's not shaming Israel by doing this.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.380]   God's doing something very powerful.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:09.700]   He's saying, "You need to know where you're starting.
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.500]   You need to be honest
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.420]   about the names that the enemy has spoken to you.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.580]   Before I give you a new name,
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.980]   let me uproot the old names.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.060]   Let me tell you that old name."
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.860]   In order for God to give Israel a new destiny,
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.260]   he had to first invite them to be honest
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.460]   about their current one.
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.300]   Come on, church.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.020]   Not to shame them,
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.140]   not to embarrass them
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.620]   because he really wants to help them.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.980]   And that help's gonna start when Israel goes,
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.100]   "Oh man, I've embraced some names.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.300]   I've called myself abandoned.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.940]   I've called myself desolate.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.420]   And that has begun to shape my thinking about God
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.620]   and my thinking about others
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.100]   and my thinking about my future.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.220]   And this is where I'm at, God."
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.940]   This is my 10th year as senior pastor here at the Vine.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.020]   And over these past 10 years,
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.980]   I've had to go through a very important
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.860]   and challenging journey
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.020]   of owning the names that I have named myself,
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.340]   of wrestling with the things
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.260]   that I feel the enemy has placed in me,
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.340]   that I've regurgitated and embraced
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.940]   and made an identity of.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.700]   And I've had to wrestle with the Holy Spirit
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.660]   in a place of deep honesty about my broken names
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:45.180]   in order for me to receive a new name from him.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.580]   I wanna just share some of the names
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:52.300]   that I've carried and still carry at times.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.740]   The first would be forsaken.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:59.060]   I've called myself forsaken and I felt forsaken.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.540]   This happened when in my early 30s,
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.140]   I found out that I wasn't able
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.820]   to biologically father children.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.900]   And when I found out that I couldn't do
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.900]   the very one thing that I had my heart set on,
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.180]   I wanted a family, I wanted to build a family.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.980]   And when I discovered I couldn't do it,
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.700]   I was so angry at God
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.860]   because God had given me the dream for a family,
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.180]   but then it created me in such a way
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.180]   that it was impossible for me to do it.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.860]   And I felt like he was laughing at me.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.740]   So I felt abandoned.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.620]   I felt like I was forsaken.
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.980]   And that became a part of my identity.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.300]   Betrayer would be another name.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:40.460]   My wife, in that moment, I felt like I had betrayed her.
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.340]   I felt like I had betrayed her dreams and her hopes.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.380]   I felt like I had stopped her
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.140]   from having the one thing she had always wanted,
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.140]   which was to be pregnant.
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.900]   I felt like I had betrayed her trust in me
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.500]   and that I wasn't enough for her.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.940]   Failure.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:03.900]   If only you could be in my house on a Sunday evening
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.500]   after I preach three or four times on a Sunday,
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.580]   and you would come to understand
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.260]   how I've named myself failure.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.260]   It's a regular ritual for me to get home after a big day
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:18.500]   and say, "Honey, man, I was bad today.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.220]   "I didn't even know if anyone was listening.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.820]   "People were getting up and going to the toilet
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.180]   "and doing all this stuff."
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.180]   There were people asleep on the front row.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.860]   No shame, no shame, I'm just being honest.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.380]   And I'd get home and I'd say to her on a regular basis,
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.860]   "Am I doing anything that's helping anyone?
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.460]   "Maybe I should do something else."
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.300]   My wife would always go, "Oh gosh, here he goes again."
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.900]   And then she'd pass me a gin and tonic.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.740]   "Take this, everything will be fine."
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.100]   Hurter.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:55.340]   Hurter is a name I've embraced recently.
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.060]   Being in leadership is a difficult thing.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.500]   Many of us in this room are in leadership.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.180]   Leadership's hard and it's difficult and challenging.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.500]   And I've taken on the identity of someone who hurts somebody
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.220]   because I've made mistakes in leadership
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.900]   and that has hurt people.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.740]   People on my staff and people in the congregation,
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.340]   particularly during some challenging times
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.500]   over the last three or four years
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.780]   when we were dealing with stuff in our city
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.460]   that we didn't know how to deal with.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.180]   I know that I've hurt people in how I've led here.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.060]   And I've taken on that as part of my persona and identity
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.180]   that I'm a hurter of people.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.900]   Liar.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.900]   By the way, this is a really bad list
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.780]   of things for your senior pastor to have.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.540]   I hope you come back next week.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.220]   But liar.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.060]   Not that I go out and try to lie on a regular basis,
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.020]   but I know that sometimes there's a very thin line
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.620]   between the person I'm projecting to be
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.980]   and the person I really am.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.580]   And I'm not just talking about my Instagram posts.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.940]   But I think for all of us,
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.500]   often there's that fine line, isn't there,
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.980]   between what we want people to think about ourselves,
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.420]   how we want other people to label us,
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.540]   and if they really knew us, like really knew us,
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.780]   they would understand that the story is very different.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.620]   And over the past 10 years, I've had to wrestle with these
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.860]   'cause I realized these are names
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.780]   that have come to form and shape me.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.380]   And I think that you would be able
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.220]   to write your own list here
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.980]   of some of the things that you're carrying.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.180]   Israel starts from the point of God saying,
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.780]   "Know the names that you are carrying."
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.460]   'Cause it's from that point that He can now speak.
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.060]   Notice what He says next here in verses four and five.
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.300]   He says, "I know that you've called yourself abandoned.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.060]   "Your name will no longer be desolate,
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.700]   "for you will be called Hephzibah,
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.060]   "and your land will be called Beulah."
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.580]   Hephzibah means my delight is in her.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.820]   Beulah means the land is married
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.020]   or there is a marriage that takes place.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.300]   I want you to see what God does here
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.460]   'cause it's super powerful.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.820]   He steps into this horrible moment for Israel
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.300]   where they're dealing with the reality
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.060]   of how they've begun to name themselves.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.740]   And God says, "I've got a new name for you,
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.660]   "and my name for you is the absolute opposite
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.860]   "of how you're naming yourself right now.
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.220]   "You need to know that what I speak over you
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.620]   "is the complete opposite of it.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:07.440]   "You feel abandoned, but you're actually married.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.340]   "You think you've been given up on,
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.060]   "but actually your name is Beulah.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.780]   "I married you, I love you, I'm here with you,
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.580]   "I'm walking with you, I'm intimate with you.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.780]   "Like the intimacy of husband and wife and marriage
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.020]   "is my heart towards you, my people.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.100]   "Oh, you feel desolate, you feel dry inside?
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.860]   "I understand that, I get that,
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.780]   "but I name you like this idea of Hephzibah,
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.340]   "which is my delight is in you.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.940]   "I have a delight in you, I love you, I see you.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.320]   "You're not dried up and given up on.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.720]   "There's no joy left, I've got delight,
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.900]   "and I want you to know my delight in you."
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.820]   So he names Israel the absolute opposite
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.780]   of what they were naming themselves.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.460]   And this is always a work of the spirit of God in church.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.060]   He always comes up to you who are carrying broken names,
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.580]   names that say something about you that is not true.
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.740]   And God says, "You're not that, you're actually this.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.600]   "You're not this broken stuff here.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.380]   "I want you to know how I see you,
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.860]   "the way I wanted you to be,
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.540]   "and the way that you were created to be in Christ Jesus.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.820]   "Even though there's a difference
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.660]   "between who you really are in Christ
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.500]   "and who you've come to believe in your brokenness,
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.980]   "I'm not gonna give you a name here,
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.700]   "I'm gonna give you a name here,
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.380]   "and this name is gonna uproot that name."
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.620]   Abandoned, married.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.980]   Desolate, total delight.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:26.380]   And God is doing this 'cause he so cares for his people.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:32.700]   And he wants his people to know the goodness of a God
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.100]   who changes everything.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.860]   And I want you to see something here
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.460]   that's really important.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.860]   God does not name us based on our past actions,
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.740]   our present actions, or our future actions.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.180]   Praise God.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.060]   He names us on Jesus's past actions,
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.260]   Jesus's present actions, and Jesus's future actions.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.940]   That's the way God names his people.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.700]   In other words, he doesn't name you because of you.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.900]   He names you because of him.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.060]   He names you of his son, Jesus.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.660]   Like how my name is Andrew George,
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.020]   connected to the men in my family.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.100]   God sees you as his family,
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.740]   and he wants to connect you to his son, Christ Jesus,
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.580]   his one and only son.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:19.060]   And so when he sees you, and when he speaks names over you,
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.060]   he names you in the generations of his family,
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.740]   right down to Jesus Christ.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.940]   And he says, "You carry Jesus's name.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.900]   "You carry my son's name.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.960]   "You may not feel like you're righteous,
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.180]   "but you're righteous.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.820]   "You may not feel holy, you're holy.
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.180]   "You may not feel like you have grace.
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.360]   "I have graced you.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.180]   "These are the names for you."
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.020]   And he's calling his people to walk in the power
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.500]   of a new name, so that they would be in the trajectory
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.800]   and the destiny that he has for them.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.300]   But I want you to hear this.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.180]   I want you to hear something really important.
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.780]   Just because you have a new name,
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.800]   and therefore a new future,
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.900]   does not mean immediately you have a new nature.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.220]   Come on, church, that's really good.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.660]   Someone should write that down.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.180]   Just because you have a new name and a new future
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.300]   does not mean you immediately have a new nature.
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.020]   And when God names us, what he's doing
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.460]   is he's declaring the starting point of a process.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.220]   He's declaring a starting point of a new journey,
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.260]   a starting point of a new identity,
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.440]   a starting point of a new time in him.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.100]   When he says you are holy, he's not necessarily saying
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.580]   you're holy in this moment, but you're holy in Christ Jesus.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.620]   You're holy through the blood of Jesus.
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.300]   And you're on a trajectory and a destiny and a growth
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.780]   of becoming more and more like Christ Jesus.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.980]   The Vine's whole vision statement
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.340]   is that we are growing big people here.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.820]   Ephesians 4, Paul says, we become more and more
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.620]   like the image of Christ.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.980]   That's a journey that we're on.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.500]   It's the journey of sanctification.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.540]   But because Jesus is the alpha and the omega,
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.340]   the beginning and the end, at the start of a new journey,
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.880]   he declares the outcome right at the beginning.
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:13.780]   You're holy, you're righteous, you're forgiven,
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.500]   you're filled with grace.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.460]   Notice how he says it here in Isaiah 42,
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.300]   the same sort of section of scripture,
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.660]   just back a couple of chapters.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.260]   He says, I am the Lord, that is my name.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.460]   I will not give my glory to another.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.140]   See, the form of things have taken place
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:32.020]   and new things now I declare over you.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:36.700]   Before they spring into being, I announce them to you.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.500]   Before they even happen, I'm gonna declare them.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.000]   I'm gonna make the ends your beginning.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.740]   Before it even takes place,
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.940]   before you even grow into this new identity,
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.340]   I declare it over you because I'm saying
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.180]   this is now who you are.
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.780]   Uproot the broken names.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.860]   You are not a failure, you are my son.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:06.740]   My daughter's name is Mia Lynn Gardner.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.320]   What a beautiful name.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.500]   Her last name, Gardner, funnily enough, is my last name.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.100]   And it links her to incredible English heritage
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.380]   that goes all the way back to Prince Michael of Kent.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.700]   Well, it doesn't, but hey.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:29.900]   Lynn is my wife's mother's first name.
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.900]   And we named her that because we wanted her name
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.460]   to take her back to her New Zealand family
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.420]   and the years and years of heritage and legacy she has
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.700]   from those from New Zealand.
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:45.100]   Mia is Latin for mine.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:49.260]   It was Chris and I who had struggled to have children
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:53.540]   say over this girl, she is mine.
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:56.340]   Could you imagine what it would be like for Mia
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.420]   who has been adopted?
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.080]   Mia who was once in an institution,
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   who didn't actually have a family,
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.740]   for us to come along and say,
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.420]   we know what your name is right now,
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.860]   but we're giving you a new name.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.340]   We're actually declaring the end right here
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.180]   at the beginning.
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.700]   Your name is Mia because you're mine.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.460]   You're no longer abandoned.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.240]   You're no longer left alone.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.100]   You're no longer gonna be in an institution.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.180]   You have a family and that family has heritage and legacy,
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.380]   importance and name, and you are a child.
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.140]   And every time we say your name, Mia,
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.780]   it's like we're re-declaring that you are mine,
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.220]   that you are not abandoned anymore.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.140]   Every time Mia says her name,
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.040]   it's her way also of aligning to the new destiny
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:37.880]   that she's in.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.940]   It's her way of saying these parents are mine.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.320]   This family is mine.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.700]   These people are mine.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:47.060]   We broke that wrong identity over her
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.020]   and gave her a new name.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.200]   In fact, in her crib, I wanna show you a photo.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.060]   This is her crib at the institution where she was.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.820]   We put a sign up saying, my new name is Mia.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.700]   Because I am someone's now.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:06.660]   What are the names that you're carrying around you
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.580]   that are not of God,
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.060]   that is your brokenness speaking to you
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.820]   and forming who you think you are
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.960]   when actually God has something for you?
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.760]   I know I've gone a bit longer, but I really,
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.580]   this is a very important word for me to share.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.140]   I hope you understand that.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.220]   And it's important for us as a church to be with.
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:28.460]   And I wanna just take two more minutes
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.580]   to finish with one more scripture.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.740]   Is that okay?
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.100]   'Cause I wanna give you a practical way
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.640]   that you can begin to rename yourself this week.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.420]   A practical way for you to hear the mouth of God
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.060]   say something new over you that has the power
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.180]   to uproot whatever failure, I'm not good enough,
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.180]   I'm not attractive, I'm not whatever it might be
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.980]   that's going on in your life.
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.600]   This is taken from Revelations chapter two,
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.960]   Jesus speaking to the church at the end of all things.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.040]   Notice what he says.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.040]   He says, "Those who have ears to hear,
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.720]   let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.480]   To those who have overcome,
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.820]   I will give some of the hidden manna.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.960]   I will also give them a white stone
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.560]   with a new name written on it,
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.280]   known only to them who receives it."
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.640]   I love this idea that Jesus would say
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.880]   at the end of all things,
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.080]   he's going to give us a white stone.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.920]   It's a stone because it is indestructible,
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.560]   symbolizing eternity, and it's white
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.040]   because it's the righteousness and the glory of Christ,
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.800]   his salvation and cleanliness in us.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.720]   And he says, "I'm gonna give you a white stone,
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.040]   and on that white stone, I'm gonna write a name on it,
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.220]   and this is a new name that I have for you.
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.800]   It's unique to you, I'm not giving it to anybody else.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.640]   This is a name that you need to know."
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.020]   Why is it unique to us?
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.240]   Because every single one of us
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.160]   has uniquely been formed by the enemy,
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.260]   uniquely shaped by the broken words spoken into our lives
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.800]   over however many years it is that we've been alive.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.080]   And so the unique name that comes from God
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.680]   is the opposite of how the enemy has tried to form us.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   And at the end of all things,
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.000]   he's going to give us that name that will reject,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.720]   turn away, uproot all of that brokenness,
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.320]   and say, "You have overcome.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.020]   You can come into eternity with me.
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:13.280]   Know this unique name that I give you now
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.240]   for the destiny that you have, eternity in me."
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.400]   Here's the practical thing I want you to do.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.880]   Every single one of you, hopefully, as you came in today,
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.520]   were given a white stone.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.920]   You're probably like, "What is that about?"
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.120]   If you didn't get one on the way out,
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.560]   you can grab one on the way out.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.880]   But these white stones,
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.200]   I want you to do something very practical this week.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.840]   I want you to put this somewhere
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.640]   where you're gonna see it every day.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.760]   It might be by your computer at work.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.760]   That's a great place to put it.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.040]   No one's gonna come by your desk and go,
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.680]   "Why do you have a white stone on your,
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.680]   like, white stones just will be invisible
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.000]   to everybody else."
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.880]   But you'll put it on your desk,
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.040]   or maybe you'll put it by your mirror in your bathroom,
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.840]   or maybe you'll put it on your living room,
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.120]   like a cupboard or a sideboard or something like that.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.480]   But as you put the white stone there,
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.400]   here's what you're doing.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.840]   You're reminding yourself that you carry names
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.040]   that you don't want to carry anymore.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.500]   Remember, the starting point for Israel
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.640]   was that very thought,
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.760]   "Oh, I'm carrying some honest names
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.680]   that I don't want anymore."
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.040]   The white stone is a reminder to you
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.400]   that you carry those names,
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.240]   and it's an invitation to you to be honest about them.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.640]   I've been honest about mine
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.360]   in front of 700 people here today.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.440]   Would you be honest about yours before Jesus?
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.060]   And as you're honest about your name,
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:32.320]   the white stones are a reminder to you
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.300]   that you have a new name.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.860]   And as well as letting God know the names,
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.980]   the broken names that you're carrying,
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:42.200]   may you then open your ears to hear the new names
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.640]   that He wants to give you that day,
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.360]   and say, "You're not a failure.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.880]   You're my child, and I love you.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.280]   And with you, I am well pleased."
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.940]   If we're gonna see the new thing that God is doing in us,
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.040]   we need to recognize that there's a broken identity
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.760]   that all of us battle with,
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.880]   that there is this difference
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   between who we are in Christ Jesus
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.560]   and who we've come to believe we are through our brokenness,
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.360]   and God can change the trajectory.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.020]   I pray you take this word and really, really take it to heart
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.580]   and allow the Holy Spirit to do some beautiful work in you.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.700]   Would you stand with me?
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:18.940]   And I wanna pray for you.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.980]   And maybe if you're comfortable, you can open your hands.
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:30.660]   And I know, again, we've gone a little bit longer,
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.660]   but I want you just to take some time now
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.780]   not to rush this bit.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.020]   This bit's the most important part, actually,
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.680]   as we spend some time with Christ Jesus,
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.980]   as we spend some time with the Holy Spirit,
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.060]   as we think about the white stone in our hands,
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:52.140]   as we're honest about some of the names
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.300]   that we know we hold,
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:42:00.380]   and as we listen afresh to the truth of God,
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.560]   speak over the lies of the enemy.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.260]   You are not forsaken.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.520]   You are not a betrayer.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.780]   You are not a failure.
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.300]   You are not a herder of people.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.560]   You are not a liar.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.020]   You are not what your teacher said about you.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.380]   You are not what that person said.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:23.000]   You are not what your ex-whatever said to you.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.860]   You are not what those test results might say to you.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.100]   You are and always will be only what Jesus Christ
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:29.940]   says to you.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.100]   Through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus,
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.240]   he names you my son, my daughter.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.320]   With you, I am well pleased.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.800]   Lord, I pray you would uproot today and this week
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.360]   names that have long held us captive
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.560]   to the slavery of our soul,
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.840]   and I pray, Lord, you would release us
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:53.140]   to a new season of hope, a new season of life.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.060]   Lord, I pray that you would bring a name
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.680]   that is the opposite of the name
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.440]   that the people in this room are carrying.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.920]   Lord, I pray that it would free them
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.160]   from the weight of burden, the weight of expectancy,
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.040]   the weight of feeling like a failure.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.720]   Lord, I pray you would release people
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.480]   into a new destiny that is only shaped by you,
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.860]   that your mouth would bestow the name they need to hear.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.420]   Father, we need this for our city.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.340]   We need this for us.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.800]   We need this for our workplaces, for our families.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.960]   Release your church to a new name, Lord.
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.240]   Take some time.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.420]   We're gonna have a prayer team in a moment
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.860]   available for you, and we'll stand and we'll pray with you.
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.440]   If you would like prayer in a moment
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.900]   after the service finishes, please come forward for prayer,
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:43.780]   'cause I know for some of you,
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.280]   this is important to take the time to do this,
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.620]   but for all of us, let's now just take a moment
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.700]   to respond in worship, and allow this worship time
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.060]   to be a time for you to ask the Holy Spirit,
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.420]   what are some of these names I'm carrying, Lord?
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.300]   What are some of the things
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.400]   that you want me to lay before you today?
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.980]   (gentle music)
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.400]   (soft music)
