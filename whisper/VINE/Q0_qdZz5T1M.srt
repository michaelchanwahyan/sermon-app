1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
 Amen, amen, have a seat, have a seat.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,440
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,300
 If you've just joined the Vine

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,440
 or only been a part of us for a little while,

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,700
 we're so glad that you are here with us.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,540
 We're in a series on the Holy Spirit.

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,660
 We've been opening the scriptures

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,120
 around the Spirit each week.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,820
 And I wanna share out of a passage

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,520
 of the Apostle Paul writing to the church in Ephesus.

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,340
 And Paul was a prolific man of prayer,

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,540
 loved to pray for people, loved to pray for his church.

13
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,780
 He was deeply pastoral.

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,380
 And in the book of Ephesians,

15
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,980
 he actually prays a number of times.

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,020
 And often when Paul prays,

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,900
 he's not just kind of like offering a prayer.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,260
 He's not just like Lord Jesus, amen kind of thing.

19
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,020
 He's actually trying to communicate

20
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,060
 and teach something to the church.

21
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,140
 His prayers are some of the deepest theological things

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,860
 that are found in his word.

23
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,620
 You can unpack them and get a sense

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,140
 of how he wants to pastor his church.

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,700
 And in the prayer I'm gonna read you here this morning,

26
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,740
 he says something about the Spirit.

27
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,020
 And what he says about the Spirit

28
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,580
 is one of these paradoxes that we're gonna be unpacking

29
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,420
 throughout our series,

30
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,860
 these both and elements of the Spirit.

31
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,020
 And this one is particularly key

32
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,900
 because this one draws us

33
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,500
 into a deeper knowledge of God himself.

34
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
 Let me read this to you from Ephesians 1,

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,720
 starting in verse 15.

36
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,860
 He says, "For this reason,

37
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,260
 ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus

38
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,540
 and your love for all the saints,

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,620
 I have not stopped giving thanks for you,

40
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,700
 remembering you in my prayers."

41
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,340
 And here's what I pray.

42
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,620
 "I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,

43
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,340
 the glorious Father, may give to you the Spirit,"

44
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,580
 or in other translations,

45
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,580
 "that the Spirit would give to you wisdom and revelation

46
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,100
 so that you may know him better."

47
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,980
 Father, our prayer this morning as we gather in this room

48
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,140
 in the overflow online is that that would happen in us,

49
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,700
 that as you open your scriptures to us,

50
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,820
 as you speak a fresh word to us,

51
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,580
 that we would come to know you deeper, better.

52
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,420
 And Lord, I believe that you have a personal thing

53
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,800
 that you wanna say to every person

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,680
 in this room here this morning.

55
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,860
 And just as Emma has so beautifully prepared us,

56
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,940
 as we've brought that sacrifice of praise to you,

57
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,980
 as we've entered your gates with thanksgiving in our hearts,

58
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,020
 Lord, we pray now that you would reveal

59
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,580
 the innermost sort of passions and love

60
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,640
 that you have in your heart for each person in this room.

61
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,620
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

62
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,460
 Everyone says.

63
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,500
 Amen.

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,880
 So a number of years ago, my wife and I, Christine,

65
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,580
 we were in Bible school in Auckland, in New Zealand.

66
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,180
 And my wife's from New Zealand,

67
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,420
 so when we decided to go to Bible school,

68
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,120
 we looked at lots of places we could have gone to,

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,180
 we decided New Zealand was the place.

70
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,020
 Auckland was the Bible school that we wanted to go to.

71
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,380
 And it was a great place, we loved it.

72
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,820
 But we always wanted to get out of Auckland

73
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,340
 and explore New Zealand.

74
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,820
 So on one particular long weekend,

75
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,980
 we decided we're gonna take a four-hour drive

76
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,080
 up to the north of New Zealand.

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,260
 Now, the further you go north in New Zealand,

78
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,580
 the less people there are.

79
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,300
 There's not a lot of people in New Zealand in general, okay?

80
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,860
 But the further north you go, the less people there are.

81
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,620
 And a friend of ours had a house in a place called Russell,

82
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,540
 which is kind of northeast on the North Island.

83
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,540
 And so from where we were in Auckland to get there,

84
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,060
 it's about four hours.

85
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,460
 We had lectures all day, so we had to stay,

86
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,540
 but we decided to leave at around about six o'clock

87
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,380
 at night.

88
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,660
 About three hours in, around about nine o'clock,

89
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,820
 we knew that we would enter into this village.

90
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,540
 And we had seen on the map that this village

91
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,060
 was the last largest populated area

92
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,340
 before we would end up where we were gonna go.

93
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,740
 And so if we needed to eat,

94
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,800
 if we were gonna eat some food,

95
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,180
 we needed to stop in this particular village.

96
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,060
 On the map, it looked like a decent-sized village.

97
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,820
 And I've come to learn that New Zealand

98
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,560
 kind of exaggerates the size of their towns on maps

99
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,360
 to make themselves feel a bit better.

100
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,980
 And so we arrive at this town at like nine o'clock at night,

101
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,160
 and it literally was like way smaller

102
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,700
 than we were predicting.

103
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,740
 It only had like one little road

104
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,720
 where there were some restaurants.

105
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,620
 And we were there, like I say, about nine o'clock.

106
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,900
 And so most of the restaurants there were shut.

107
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,060
 In fact, there was only one restaurant

108
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,300
 that was open at that particular time

109
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,860
 on that particular night, only one restaurant.

110
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,660
 I wonder if you could imagine with me

111
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,860
 what type of restaurant it was

112
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,260
 that was open at nine o'clock at night

113
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,900
 in the middle of nowhere in New Zealand.

114
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,980
 Anyone get it?

115
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,980
 It was a Chinese takeaway restaurant.

116
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,600
 Yes, it was.

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,060
 And not just a Chinese takeaway restaurant.

118
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,060
 No, no, no, no, no.

119
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,460
 It was a Hong Kong-style Chinese takeaway.

120
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,060
 I could tell right away,

121
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,140
 this looked like a dai pai dong from Mongkok or something.

122
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,540
 Like it just reeked Hong Kong.

123
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,480
 And of course, we were homesick at the time.

124
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,540
 And I was like, oh my gosh, this is so amazing.

125
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,100
 There's a Hong Kong Chinese restaurant.

126
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,060
 It's open.

127
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,060
 And it kind of, in the front of its door,

128
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,920
 it had like the beads that kind of go down

129
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,500
 to keep the flies out and stuff.

130
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,500
 And I said to Chris, I said, I'm gonna go in there

131
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,380
 and I'm gonna whip out my best Cantonese.

132
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,500
 You know, like I haven't spoken Cantonese for a while.

133
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,540
 This is gonna be awesome.

134
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,500
 And so sure enough, I was like,

135
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,900
 and I jumped into this restaurant.

136
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,900
 I'm like, (speaking in foreign language)

137
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,460
 (audience laughing)

138
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,380
 (speaking in foreign language)

139
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,820
 So, thank you, thank you, thank you.

140
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,500
 So, so I whip out my amazing,

141
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,700
 immaculate, perfectly pronounced Cantonese.

142
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,500
 The man behind the counter, he's like 80 years old.

143
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,260
 He's like the kind of guy when you go into a restaurant here

144
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,780
 has like a cigarette hanging out of their mouth, you know,

145
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,660
 like with the ash that's like, you know,

146
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,720
 gonna fall into the thing.

147
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,380
 Like he's 80 years old, the oldest Chinese guy

148
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,220
 I think I've seen in a while.

149
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,180
 He's like so wrinkled and stuff.

150
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,020
 But as he hears my Cantonese, his face,

151
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,100
 he starts to smile, like the smile,

152
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,580
 literally years of youth enter his face.

153
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,620
 It's like he suddenly becomes a new man.

154
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,540
 He's so excited that there's somebody in his restaurant,

155
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,380
 speaking Cantonese.

156
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,220
 It's almost like him and his wife must've decided

157
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,900
 they're gonna plant a restaurant

158
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,100
 in the middle of this Chinese village

159
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,140
 or this village in New Zealand.

160
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,940
 And they get there and there's like no Chinese

161
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,180
 for miles around, right?

162
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,500
 He's never heard Cantonese for years.

163
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,980
 Here's this white guy speaking Cantonese in his restaurant.

164
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,860
 He thinks this is the greatest thing

165
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,980
 that has ever happened to him.

166
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,420
 So he starts speaking Cantonese back at me.

167
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,700
 And I tell you, he was like,

168
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,180
 (speaking in foreign language)

169
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,580
 (audience laughing)

170
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,580
 Little does he know that I've exhausted

171
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,660
 every piece of Cantonese I have ever spoken.

172
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,500
 But he doesn't know that.

173
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,180
 He's just going, (speaking in foreign language)

174
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,180
 I'm like, hi, hi, hi.

175
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,500
 (audience laughing)

176
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,300
 Pretending like I know what's going on, right?

177
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,780
 At one point he tells a joke.

178
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,660
 I'm assuming 'cause he laughs, I'm like.

179
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,100
 (laughing)

180
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,580
 At one point I know he asked me a question

181
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,020
 because at the end of what he was saying,

182
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,340
 he like, ah, you know, it's like,

183
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,780
 (speaking in foreign language)

184
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,180
 And then he pauses and looks at me and I'm like.

185
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,020
 (audience laughing)

186
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,300
 And then he just keeps going, you know.

187
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,020
 This guy, like years washed off him

188
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,500
 'cause somebody had entered in and spoken

189
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,700
 just a little bit, a little utterance

190
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,100
 of the native language that was in his heart.

191
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,100
 Every human being is made in the image of God.

192
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,100
 And every human being has the same singular heart language

193
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,380
 embedded in their soul.

194
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,540
 And it's the heart language of the Spirit of God.

195
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,220
 And whether they know it or not,

196
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,060
 whether they believe in God or not,

197
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,340
 every single human being has a longing,

198
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,980
 a crying, a desperation deep within their soul

199
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,100
 to connect with the living God.

200
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,180
 And the Spirit of God speaks.

201
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,700
 And when the Spirit of God speaks into the person

202
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,780
 whose heart has long not heard the very language

203
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,540
 that brings them alive, they can't help but be changed.

204
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,460
 I mean, that guy in that restaurant that night

205
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,860
 hearing Cantonese changed him.

206
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,700
 He kind of came alive.

207
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,220
 But I tell you what, when the Spirit of God speaks,

208
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,380
 when the Spirit of God speaks a word in season,

209
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,700
 when the Spirit of God says something

210
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,020
 or brings something in the scriptures alive to us,

211
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,100
 it literally comes and changes and transforms us.

212
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,660
 The work of the Spirit of God,

213
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,260
 the voice of the Spirit in our lives

214
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,980
 is designed to change us, to heal our hearts,

215
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,460
 to make us anew.

216
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,160
 What I was teaching us in week one

217
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,820
 about going from disorder to order,

218
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,820
 that's the purpose of the reason why the Spirit speaks.

219
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,620
 I mean, think about that for a moment.

220
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,620
 The very reason that the Spirit speaks

221
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,020
 is so that He can move His people

222
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,540
 from a place of disorder into a place of order.

223
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,300
 The Spirit communicates in order to change us.

224
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,780
 He changes us by communicating to us.

225
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,940
 That make sense?

226
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,080
 And when that voice comes,

227
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,300
 when we hear it deep within ourselves,

228
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,620
 everything shifts, everything begins to change.

229
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,880
 And like I said in week one,

230
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,820
 it's because the Holy Spirit is a person.

231
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,980
 And because the Holy Spirit is a person,

232
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,880
 He longs to be in relationship with us,

233
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,260
 that connection that we can have with the Spirit.

234
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,660
 We saw in week one that there was this idea

235
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,980
 of the fellowship of the Spirit.

236
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,120
 So our connection point to the Spirit

237
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,300
 is found in this kind of reciprocal relationship

238
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,060
 we can have in communication,

239
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,860
 Him communicating to us so that we are changed

240
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,260
 and us communicating with Him

241
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,220
 and deepening our relationship with God.

242
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,600
 And the reason why this is all taking place

243
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,500
 is because God longs to bring into all of us

244
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,020
 clarity and focus.

245
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,300
 He loves to bring into all of us wholeness.

246
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,680
 It's that order that the Spirit of God

247
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,820
 is moving us towards.

248
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,020
 He wants you to be whole, to be clear about life,

249
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,660
 to move out of confusion.

250
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,180
 When the Spirit speaks, it's never to bring confusion.

251
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,340
 It's always to turn confusion on its head.

252
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,660
 The Spirit always wants to bring clarity

253
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,940
 and refreshment and newness and wholeness to you.

254
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,700
 That doesn't mean though,

255
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,060
 that every time the Spirit speaks,

256
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,440
 it's gonna be something you're gonna wanna hear.

257
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,820
 So often when the Spirit speaks,

258
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,260
 the Spirit actually does the contrary.

259
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,300
 He actually says something that we don't want to hear,

260
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,620
 but we need to hear.

261
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,060
 Doesn't mean always that the Spirit

262
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,700
 has such nice things to say.

263
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,120
 Sometimes the word comes from the Spirit

264
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,180
 that actually shapes and changes

265
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,060
 'cause He needs to disrupt the disorder

266
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,900
 in order to bring the order.

267
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,740
 But no matter how it happens,

268
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,580
 the Spirit's word changes all.

269
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,340
 If I was to summarize it, I would put it like this.

270
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,420
 The Spirit's goal is to communicate to you

271
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,780
 so that you would receive clarity, wisdom, and understanding

272
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,380
 so that you would be strengthened, comforted, and changed.

273
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,060
 That's a good slide to take a photo of

274
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,660
 if you wanna take a slide photo.

275
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,020
 This idea that He wants to bring clarity and wisdom

276
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,940
 and understanding into us so that we would be strengthened,

277
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,020
 comforted, and changed is the work of the Spirit.

278
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,100
 It's that native language that sits within all of us.

279
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,900
 And when we hear the Spirit,

280
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,620
 something within us begins to shift.

281
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,940
 Something within us begins to change.

282
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,260
 And why do we change?

283
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,220
 Because the Spirit leads us to the person of Jesus.

284
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,540
 Remember, it's Jesus that changes everything.

285
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,920
 And the Spirit's role is to illuminate Jesus,

286
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,860
 to help us to see Jesus clearer and better

287
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,740
 so that in Jesus, we can be transformed and renewed.

288
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,580
 In the same way that Jesus's role is to reveal the Father,

289
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,220
 the Spirit's role is to reveal Jesus.

290
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,260
 You following?

291
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,480
 So it's the Spirit speaks to us in that native language

292
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,860
 that all of our souls are crying out for

293
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,880
 so that we would see Jesus more clearly

294
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,820
 so that we would ultimately come to know the Father.

295
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,200
 The Spirit into Jesus, Jesus into the Father,

296
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,200
 the triune Godhead at work because God's voice is at work.

297
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,560
 This is why when Paul picks up this prayer for the church,

298
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,000
 he wants to help them to understand

299
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,840
 how the Spirit connects us to Jesus

300
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,000
 so that we can know the Father.

301
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And he mentions this next kind of and/or paradox

302
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,600
 that we're looking at,

303
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,520
 or the both/and paradox that we're looking at in this series.

304
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,960
 And it's the idea of teaching and revelation.

305
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,460
 Let me read this to you from Ephesians 1, verse 17 again.

306
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,180
 I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,

307
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,260
 the glorious Father,

308
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,340
 may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation,

309
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,380
 or in other translations,

310
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,980
 the spirit that brings wisdom and revelation

311
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,360
 so that you may know Him better.

312
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,620
 Now, that's not the Spirit of God.

313
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,780
 Now, before I break this down

314
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,940
 into its individual parts,

315
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,760
 let me step you back for a moment,

316
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,400
 and you need to see the whole.

317
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,200
 It's so beautiful what Paul is saying here.

318
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,520
 He's praying to the church.

319
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,300
 His desire for them is to know God more.

320
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,940
 He wants them to know God better,

321
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,680
 and he understands that the only way

322
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,240
 that they're gonna know God better

323
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,080
 is through the work of the Spirit

324
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,280
 in teaching and revelation.

325
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,060
 That teaching and revelation provides for us,

326
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,440
 as Paul writes it here, wisdom and revelation,

327
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
 it provides for us the pathway

328
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,420
 to be able to get to know Jesus better.

329
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,920
 An analogy might be to think of this

330
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,240
 a little bit like Zacchaeus in Luke chapter 19.

331
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,480
 You'll be perhaps familiar with the story of Zacchaeus.

332
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,920
 Zacchaeus, we're told in the Scriptures, was a short person,

333
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
 and because he was short,

334
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,460
 he didn't have the stature to see over the crowd

335
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,680
 in order to capture a good glimpse of Jesus.

336
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,440
 And on this one particular day, Jesus is walking by,

337
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,900
 but Zacchaeus, being small,

338
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,680
 can't see Him properly through the crowd.

339
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,280
 And so Zacchaeus does a smart thing.

340
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,280
 He runs ahead, finds a tree, he climbs up this tree

341
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,800
 so he can get a clear view of Jesus.

342
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,240
 And then Jesus and him lock eyes together,

343
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,720
 and Zacchaeus invites Jesus to his house,

344
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,980
 and Jesus transforms not just Zacchaeus' life,

345
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,400
 but his whole family life.

346
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,520
 It's a beautiful part of Scripture.

347
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,840
 I think that's analogous

348
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,640
 to what Paul is trying to communicate here.

349
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,360
 Every single one of us, if you will,

350
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,300
 we're short in stature

351
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,480
 when it comes to being able to see Jesus.

352
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,440
 Our sin, our brokenness, and our flesh

353
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,320
 does not work to help us to see Jesus more clearly.

354
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,880
 Our sin is a little bit like a crowd in front of us,

355
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,320
 a crowd that's taller than we are,

356
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,120
 so that we're not able to be able to connect and see Jesus.

357
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,340
 But God has provided for us a way

358
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,800
 that we can move up above that sin,

359
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,040
 above that brokenness, to deal with it, if you will.

360
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,760
 It's a tree of His teaching

361
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,960
 and revelation by the Spirit.

362
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
 And as we go up that tree,

363
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,820
 we actually get a clearer view of who Jesus is.

364
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,720
 That's what Paul says here.

365
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,840
 I hope that the Spirit comes

366
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,920
 to bring you wisdom and revelation

367
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,760
 so you will see Him better, know Him better,

368
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,580
 engage with Him better,

369
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,240
 so that you can lift yourself out of the crowd

370
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,840
 towards the vision of Jesus, who changes everything.

371
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,840
 So I wonder whether here this morning

372
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,240
 we might have some time to climb that tree together.

373
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,680
 I wanna unpack for you what this wisdom and revelation,

374
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,380
 teaching and revelation,

375
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,320
 this two sides of this both-and paradox of the Spirit

376
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,920
 is all about for you.

377
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,600
 Paul begins with this idea of wisdom.

378
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,160
 He uses the word wisdom here.

379
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,740
 He's actually talking about this process

380
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,400
 of the Spirit teaching.

381
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,220
 I'll connect the two of them together in a moment.

382
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,320
 But he starts out by saying,

383
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,480
 look, He's gonna bring a spirit of wisdom

384
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,080
 so you can know Him better.

385
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,120
 The Greek word that Paul chooses here for wisdom,

386
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,760
 somewhat unique in this part of the Scriptures,

387
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,920
 and it's a word that has a lot of different things

388
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,680
 that come together to help you understand it.

389
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,000
 But essentially it means to illuminate,

390
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,080
 to make clear, to bring understanding, to give clarity.

391
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,760
 So the idea of wisdom is to take something,

392
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,720
 now this is really important, listen to this,

393
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,960
 take something that is already known

394
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,280
 and help us to understand it, illuminate,

395
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,440
 shine a light on something that is already present,

396
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,360
 already known, and help us to understand it

397
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,840
 so we can then embrace it for our lives.

398
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,040
 This is the concept that Paul's trying to communicate

399
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,240
 about how the Spirit works in us.

400
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,720
 It brings us understanding, illumination,

401
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,560
 teaching of what has already been given to us.

402
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,400
 Now this is really important that you notice

403
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,020
 that what it's emphasizing

404
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,360
 is something that's already been given.

405
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,880
 The teaching side is like, hey, I've given you something,

406
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,700
 whether that's my presence in the world

407
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,320
 or particularly of course the Scriptures themselves,

408
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,720
 the Word of God contained for us in the Bible.

409
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,560
 And he's like, my Spirit will help you and teach you

410
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,760
 so that he will illuminate

411
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,960
 so that you will come to a better understanding,

412
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,880
 so that you will come to see Jesus more clearly.

413
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,680
 The reality is these are just words on a page

414
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
 without the work of the Spirit in our lives.

415
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,560
 And words on a page have never changed or transformed anyone.

416
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,080
 They might have given somebody some knowledge of something,

417
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,920
 some understanding of it, but it's not transformative.

418
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,580
 And what Paul's saying is my prayer is

419
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,480
 that the Spirit will come to teach you,

420
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,520
 to illuminate, to reveal, to strengthen,

421
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,080
 to help you to see more clearly

422
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,480
 the very thing that he's already given you.

423
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,400
 That make sense?

424
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,240
 Now Jesus himself actually taught this.

425
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,360
 Let me show you Jesus speaking to the disciples

426
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,080
 in chapter 14 of John.

427
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,160
 He puts it this way.

428
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,280
 He says, "But the counselor or the advocate,

429
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,480
 the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,

430
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,040
 will," notice this, "teach you all things

431
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,380
 and remind you of everything I've said to you."

432
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,340
 So this is Jesus kind of taking the same concept

433
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,560
 that Paul's speaking about.

434
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
 And Jesus is saying, look,

435
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,600
 here's what you need to understand.

436
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,620
 The Spirit is gonna come

437
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,800
 and the Spirit will teach you all things,

438
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,840
 illuminate all things,

439
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,440
 and remind you of the things that I've already said to you.

440
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,920
 In other words, there's already stuff out there.

441
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,320
 There's my word that I've already communicated,

442
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,520
 whether that's to you directly, audibly,

443
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,120
 or whether it's written down in the Scriptures.

444
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,760
 For them, it was of course the Old Testament.

445
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,840
 He said, "In all of that, the Spirit will illuminate it

446
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,680
 so you will know me better."

447
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,480
 So he will remind you of all of the things

448
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,680
 that I have said to you.

449
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,960
 This is how you begin to climb the tree.

450
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,740
 Anyone here ever opened the Bible and fallen asleep?

451
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,000
 Come on, church, let me see the hands, be honest.

452
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,800
 That's pretty much every single one of us, I know.

453
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,880
 I've been a Christian for 30 years, I understand, okay?

454
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,060
 Even as a pastor, I open the Word sometimes

455
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,960
 and I'm tempted to fall asleep.

456
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,400
 Here's a trick.

457
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,320
 If you ever wanna stay awake reading the Scriptures,

458
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,360
 here's a trick.

459
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,260
 When you open the Scriptures, before you read it,

460
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,040
 just pray a simple prayer.

461
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,820
 Holy Spirit, would you teach me?

462
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,560
 I invite you to teach me your Word

463
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,800
 so I could become more like Christ Jesus.

464
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,340
 If you pray that every single time you open God's Word,

465
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,900
 you are aligning yourself to the Spirit of God.

466
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,180
 You are aligning yourself to the very thing

467
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,940
 that the Spirit was designed to do

468
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,120
 and that is to illuminate what has already been given,

469
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,860
 to teach you, equip you in what has already been given.

470
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,940
 That make sense?

471
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,580
 So that's an important prayer to pray

472
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,100
 when you're coming to read Scripture.

473
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,460
 Now, this all then brings us back

474
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,420
 to why Paul writes wisdom here

475
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,040
 rather than the word teaching,

476
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,100
 because the whole point is to make us

477
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,020
 more and more like Christ Jesus.

478
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,020
 Notice what he says.

479
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,860
 He says, "So that you would gain wisdom

480
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,220
 "so that you may know Him better."

481
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,620
 Wisdom is this Hebrew concept

482
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,780
 that is beyond just knowing something.

483
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,540
 When the Hebrews spoke about wisdom,

484
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,380
 what it was was it was a lifestyle,

485
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,620
 not just a mental information thing.

486
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,860
 In other words, for Paul, his prayer is

487
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,340
 when the Spirit teaches us,

488
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,020
 it doesn't just give us right information,

489
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,540
 it also leads us towards right application.

490
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,700
 And this is really important for Paul

491
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,480
 because he wants you to understand

492
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,180
 that you are a fool, the opposite of wisdom,

493
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,140
 if you allow the Spirit to give you understanding

494
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,500
 and you do nothing with it.

495
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,900
 That if you get illuminated in the Scriptures,

496
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,460
 you learn something about God

497
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,860
 and you learn something about His characters and His ways,

498
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,100
 and you walk away and don't change.

499
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,060
 He's like, "You're a fool if that's what you think."

500
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,780
 Now, the Spirit is here to bring wisdom,

501
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,900
 and wisdom, the wise, are ones who not only

502
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,720
 are illuminated by the Spirit,

503
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,220
 but then decide to put that into practice in their lives,

504
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,720
 decide to live differently, act differently,

505
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,580
 think differently, under the power and the leading

506
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,000
 and the guiding of the Spirit.

507
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,420
 Those are the ones that have actually been taught

508
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,380
 by the Spirit, Paul is saying.

509
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,860
 And my prayer is that you would receive the Spirit

510
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,240
 that teaches you to wisdom,

511
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,840
 not teaches you to foolishness, teaches you to wisdom.

512
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,100
 So, the first part of this paradox

513
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,100
 is that the Spirit teaches us the things

514
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,540
 that are already there and helps us to be illuminated,

515
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,160
 to understand, so we can apply that into our lives.

516
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,300
 But then there's the second side of this paradox,

517
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,120
 the word he uses here is revelation.

518
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,720
 Think of it this way, the Spirit does not just illuminate

519
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,740
 the word that's already received.

520
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,720
 The Spirit also reveals the word that is yet to come.

521
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,680
 This idea of revelation, the other side

522
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,900
 of the Spirit's work here, is literally the Greek word

523
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,620
 for revelation that Paul uses here,

524
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,300
 is literally translated like this,

525
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,380
 to kind of disclose or to reveal something

526
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,680
 that was previously unknown.

527
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,300
 So, notice this, guys, where teaching

528
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,040
 was about taking what was known

529
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,340
 and helping it to be understood and applied.

530
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,840
 That make sense, follow that?

531
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,940
 Revelation is taking the things

532
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,880
 that are not previously known and bringing them to us.

533
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,420
 So, there are both of these moments at work.

534
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,700
 And it's really important that you understand

535
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,460
 that these never contradict themselves.

536
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,180
 They're all from the same source, and that's the Father.

537
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,020
 And when the Father works in this world,

538
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,660
 he works by illuminating the things he's already given,

539
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,060
 and he brings a fresh revelation, a fresh perspective,

540
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,980
 a fresh idea of perhaps things

541
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,860
 that we had never even thought about before.

542
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,500
 And both of those things work together,

543
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,820
 never contradict each other.

544
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,660
 In fact, that's how we test whether revelation

545
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,540
 is really from the God or not.

546
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,180
 'Cause let's face it, sometimes we can hear

547
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,020
 some pretty weird things.

548
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
 Sometimes we can eat a really spicy curry

549
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,460
 and have a crazy thought afterwards

550
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,700
 and think that that might be Jesus.

551
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,420
 The way that we take revelation

552
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,060
 and know that it is from him is we link it to Scripture.

553
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,700
 It will never contradict it, it will always work together.

554
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,180
 But you need to know that it's not just about

555
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,320
 discovering the word that's here,

556
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,540
 there's also the spoken word of God in the here and now.

557
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,740
 And those things are beautiful

558
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,460
 because they're both the work of the Spirit,

559
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,700
 and they both help us, the tree, to climb

560
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,080
 to be able to see Jesus more clearly.

561
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,580
 I mean, just step back from this for a moment

562
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,340
 and reflect on this.

563
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,420
 We don't have a God who decided to speak

564
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,800
 to a bunch of people 2,000 years ago and then went silent.

565
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,700
 We do have a God who spoke to a bunch of people

566
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,340
 2,000 years ago, captured in the word of God,

567
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,660
 which is a rich depository of grace and goodness

568
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,680
 and life eternal.

569
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,660
 But we also have a God who's still speaking today,

570
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,500
 a God whose voice is still at work

571
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,860
 so that those souls who are crying out for connection

572
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,260
 come alive, so that like that man in the restaurant

573
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,460
 whose literally ears has dropped off his face

574
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,540
 when he heard that language,

575
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,980
 so people can still be caught up in the wonder

576
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,180
 of a God who speaks in this moment.

577
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,400
 And when God speaks, he opens up for us

578
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,540
 this idea of things that might be going on in our lives,

579
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,660
 maybe things that nobody else knows, only God knows.

580
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,700
 And God brings a word or a picture

581
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,780
 or even illuminates a Scripture

582
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,780
 that helps to transform something within us.

583
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,460
 And we're like, so many times when people

584
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,580
 like listen to people speak here at the Vine,

585
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,420
 oftentimes when I'm talking to them afterwards,

586
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,100
 they're like, well, it was just like that person

587
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
 was speaking directly to me.

588
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,540
 And I'm like, yes, that's the Holy Spirit at work for you,

589
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,780
 bringing a revelation of something he wants you

590
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,500
 to be aware of that you previously were not aware of.

591
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,180
 It's a wonder when he does that.

592
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,940
 Paul, writing just to the church in Corinth,

593
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,740
 unpacks this concept a little bit more.

594
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,700
 So I wanna dig into this just a little bit more for you.

595
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,220
 So this is 1 Corinthians 2, starting in verse 6.

596
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,060
 He writes to the church, he says,

597
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,940
 "We do, however, speak a message of wisdom

598
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,780
 amongst the mature."

599
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,240
 There again, he talks about wisdom,

600
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,980
 the teaching and the application of God's word,

601
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,380
 "But not the wisdom of this age or the rulers of this age

602
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,520
 who are coming to nothing."

603
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,300
 So Paul wants you to know that there is not just

604
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,500
 God's wisdom, there's also the wisdom of this age.

605
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,100
 And I tell you what, you will always battle as a Christian

606
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,140
 between which of those two things you apply to your life.

607
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,560
 And if you're anything like me, you apply that one,

608
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,900
 sometimes almost as much as you apply this one.

609
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,300
 This one being the word of God, by the way,

610
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,380
 the wisdom of God.

611
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,220
 Do you know what I'm saying?

612
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,320
 I think we wrestle with this, don't we?

613
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,220
 The wisdom of the world, which seems so tempting

614
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,420
 and seems so seductive to us, and God's wisdom.

615
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,260
 Paul says, "There is wisdom out there,

616
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,220
 the wisdom of the world,

617
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,180
 but we have a different wisdom," he says,

618
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,660
 "one that's been spoken amongst the mature."

619
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,380
 Verse 7, "No, we speak of God's mystery,

620
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,460
 God's wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden,

621
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,140
 so therefore it wasn't known before,

622
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,980
 that God has destined for our glory before time began.

623
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,220
 None of the rulers of this age understood it,

624
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,460
 for if they had, they would have not have crucified

625
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,560
 the Lord of glory.

626
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,900
 However, here's what's been written in the scriptures.

627
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,020
 "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived

628
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,340
 what God has prepared for those who love Him."

629
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,900
 You need to know in this room today that if you love Jesus,

630
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,460
 God has a lot prepared for you.

631
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,540
 He's prepared things for you, 'cause He loves you.

632
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,900
 Things that He's set aside,

633
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,960
 things that He's prepared in His written word

634
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,460
 that are to be illuminated and brought alive in your life,

635
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,780
 and things that He's prepared that He wants to say to you

636
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,680
 directly and personally by His Spirit.

637
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
 How does this happen?

638
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,680
 Notice verse 10, "But God has revealed it to us," by what?

639
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,500
 By His Spirit.

640
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,420
 "The Spirit searches all things,

641
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,260
 even the deep things of God.

642
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,940
 For who among people know the thoughts of a person

643
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,060
 except that person's spirit within them?

644
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,980
 In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God,"

645
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,060
 here it is, "except the Spirit of God.

646
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,560
 We have not received the Spirit of this world,

647
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,500
 but the Spirit who is from God,

648
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,960
 that we may understand what God has freely given to us.

649
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,260
 That is what we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom,

650
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,620
 but in words taught by the Spirit."

651
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,180
 Notice this, "Explaining spiritual realities

652
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,940
 by Spirit-taught words."

653
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,540
 That's revelation, my friends.

654
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,940
 I don't know about you, but that's what I want in my life.

655
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,540
 I wanna look out on this world

656
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:59,060
 and not see physical reality, but spiritual reality.

657
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,700
 I wanna see spiritual reality in my life.

658
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,740
 I want the Holy Spirit to explain

659
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,900
 spiritual realities within me

660
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,860
 and spiritual realities in my city of Hong Kong

661
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,940
 with Spirit-taught words,

662
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,820
 not from the wisdom of this world,

663
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,540
 but the wisdom that can only come

664
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,420
 from the one who is still speaking today.

665
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,420
 When we hear Spirit-taught words,

666
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,780
 it brings us into spiritual reality.

667
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,580
 So Paul is saying, look,

668
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,140
 you need to sit with this tension of the both and and.

669
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,220
 It's not just the word, it's all about the word.

670
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,540
 And it's not just revelation.

671
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,500
 It's both of these things working together.

672
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,620
 The word that is illuminated by the Spirit

673
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,380
 to great understanding and application

674
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,900
 and the revelation of the spiritual realities

675
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,620
 of this world and of our lives

676
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,380
 by Spirit-taught words that can only come from God

677
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
 because only the Spirit searches

678
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,260
 the innermost realms of God.

679
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,220
 This was happening in the gatherings

680
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,380
 that Paul's early church was in in those days.

681
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,420
 This was happening all over the place.

682
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,900
 In fact, actually in Corinth, it was happening so much

683
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,260
 that there was kind of disorder happening in the church.

684
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,100
 And remember, the Spirit is here to take disorder to order.

685
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,420
 So Paul writes to the church about this disorder

686
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,740
 that's happening in their gatherings

687
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,980
 because there's so many kind of things happening,

688
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,620
 particularly the abuse of tongues,

689
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,020
 which maybe we'll get to in another week here.

690
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,980
 But in this moment, he writes to them to understand,

691
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,660
 look, there needs to be order,

692
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,140
 and there can be order if you quieten down

693
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,700
 and open your ears to hear what the Spirit says.

694
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,700
 Let me show you this in 1 Corinthians 14, verses one to three.

695
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,460
 He says, "Follow the way of love

696
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,260
 "and eagerly desire spiritual gifts."

697
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,180
 Pastor Ellison's gonna preach on spiritual gifts

698
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,700
 in a few weeks' time, "especially the gift of prophecy.

699
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,300
 "For anyone who speaks in a tongue

700
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,540
 "does not speak to people but to God.

701
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,660
 "Indeed, no one understands that person.

702
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,060
 "They utter mysteries within their spirit.

703
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,820
 "But everyone who prophesies speaks to people

704
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,260
 "for their strengthening, encouragement, and comfort."

705
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,380
 I love this, Paul's saying,

706
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,260
 "This is why I want you to eagerly desire prophecy

707
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,280
 "in your midst, because when the Spirit speaks,

708
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,660
 "revelation comes, it is for the strengthening,

709
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,100
 "it is for the encouragement,

710
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,020
 "and it is for the comfort of the church."

711
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,180
 And he's like, why would you not want that?

712
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,860
 Like he's like, embrace prophecy amongst you.

713
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,780
 Embrace the work of the Spirit amongst you.

714
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,740
 'Cause yes, he's gonna illuminate and teach you

715
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,500
 and apply the Word so good,

716
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,740
 but he's also gonna bring that life-changing moment Word

717
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,020
 that speaks in your life.

718
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,180
 And you're like, how did the Spirit know

719
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,820
 about that work thing that's going on?

720
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,580
 Because I haven't told anyone about it.

721
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,940
 And suddenly this Word comes,

722
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,380
 spiritual realities by Spirit-taught words

723
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,260
 that changes everything for us.

724
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,940
 And like that restaurant and that guy,

725
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,780
 everything drops off us and we become the people

726
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,660
 that we were created to be.

727
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,740
 Understanding, revelation, teaching, God's Word,

728
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,900
 coming together and making us into the people

729
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,340
 that we were designed to be, disorder into order.

730
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,180
 Over our time together, hopefully today,

731
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,660
 I've done the best that I can in the teaching part,

732
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,420
 helping to illuminate the scriptures

733
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,780
 so that we can both know and apply God better.

734
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,360
 But we wanna now take some time on the revelation part.

735
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,280
 And during our service at our pre-service part time

736
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,400
 and during our worship time,

737
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,680
 our pastors and our prayer ministers here at the Vine,

738
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,880
 they've been praying and asking

739
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,720
 for specifically Spirit-taught words,

740
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,320
 revelation, prophetic words that are spoken to us

741
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,040
 so that we can speak them to you

742
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,600
 so that we can begin to listen

743
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,640
 to the Word of God that way together.

744
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,560
 I'm so excited about this.

745
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,760
 Would you stand with me?

746
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:56,520
 And as you stand, I want you to do two things.

747
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,560
 Number one, everybody look at me.

748
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,200
 Is everybody looking at me?

749
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,800
 Good looking, right?

750
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,960
 Okay, you're looking at me because here's the thing.

751
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,100
 Do not leave.

752
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,840
 Hear from your pastor.

753
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,680
 Do not leave.

754
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,640
 The Lord has something He wants to say to you, amen?

755
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,480
 That's the first thing.

756
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,480
 Second thing, I wanna encourage you just to open your hands.

757
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,600
 Because as we open our hands,

758
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,800
 we're in a posture of receiving before the Holy Spirit.

759
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,280
 And I wanna pray for us,

760
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,460
 and then we're gonna listen to some Spirit-taught words.

761
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:39,600
 Holy Spirit, we thank you for the teaching and revelation

762
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,520
 that you have poured out on your church

763
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,820
 so that we could climb that tree and see you clearly.

764
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:51,320
 And Lord, in this moment, we ask you to speak.

765
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,960
 Holy Spirit, would you speak?

766
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,520
 Lord, I believe that you have a word

767
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,480
 for a lot of people in this room.

768
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:06,060
 A word that doesn't come from human wisdom, human strength,

769
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,240
 but a word that comes from your Spirit.

770
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,020
 So Lord, we pray that you would speak.

771
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,520
 And that in these words that are about to be spoken,

772
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,540
 many people here would come alive.

773
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,680
 So just keep yourself in a posture of receiving

774
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,480
 and I'm gonna make space now for any of the pastors,

775
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,000
 prayer ministers who have a word,

776
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,400
 for people in this room to come forward and share that word.

777
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,980
 (gentle music)

778
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,640
 (bells ringing)

779
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,300
 (bells ringing)

780
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:54,300
