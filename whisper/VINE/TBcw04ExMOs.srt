1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 But we also have sweatshirts and t-shirts and bracelets and things like that,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,880
 also sporting my little branches of Hope Colors bracelet,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,560
 but we've got other stuff as well.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,400
 But beyond the bits and bobs that you can support us with,

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,760
 really what we're really hoping for is for people

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,080
 to walk alongside us in the long-term.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,560
 We really encourage you to scan the QR code, come check us out.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,520
 There's different volunteering opportunities,

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,400
 especially when we have events and initiatives.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,120
 Summer school is a great example.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,800
 We always need volunteers to run summer school.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,680
 We've got a football tournament coming up at the end of October,

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,240
 which needs hundreds of volunteers.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,040
 So, please do consider supporting us with your time and your effort.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,920
 But we also have a number of financial support initiatives

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,280
 with which we are providing continuous support to the community on a monthly basis.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,960
 So, if it's on your heart, we would also love for you to

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,160
 prayerfully consider becoming a monthly donor.

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,160
 There's a number of initiatives that you can support.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,840
 One of them is for accommodation and utility support.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,920
 There's education support.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,480
 There's a number of different ways that you can support us on a monthly basis.

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,480
 And honestly, it doesn't matter how much or how little you want to give.

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,800
 I mean, give from where your heart is at.

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,640
 But what I can guarantee you is that that goes straight to the community.

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,800
 So, really a great way of walking alongside of them.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,960
 Anyway, I've taken enough of your time.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,760
 Sorry?

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,720
 It doesn't work. Oh, my goodness.

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,600
 You have a bunch of QR codes over here.

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,960
 So, do come and check us out afterwards at the booth.

32
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,480
 See, this was just a ploy, right?

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,320
 To get you to come to the booth and scan us.

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,960
 Marketing 101, you know.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,120
 But yeah, no, sorry for that.

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,240
 But do come check us out.

37
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,000
 Otherwise, we're very easy to find.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,600
 You can just go to branchesofhope.org.hk to get our website.

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,720
 We're also on Instagram, Facebook, all the regular social.

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,120
 So, you know, do come check us out.

41
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,400
 And thank you again for giving us this platform.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,440
 Appreciate it.

43
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,240
 [ Applause ]

44
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,280
 Sorry, just one thing I forgot.

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
 I've been holding it the whole time.

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,280
 This is our prayer guide that we've brought out just for Branch of Hope Sunday in Wan Chai.

47
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,400
 This is actually really, really exciting because it allows you to, you know,

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,240
 in addition to these things, really walk alongside the community in prayer, right?

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,880
 It's a six-week prayer guide.

50
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,960
 We have three prayers for each of those weeks.

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,920
 Each week has a different theme, a different topic.

52
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,640
 So if you want to really explore this topic, if you want to really, you know,

53
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,640
 offer your prayers for the communities that we serve, I really encourage you to pick

54
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,240
 up one of these guys.

55
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,840
 You can make a little donation if you like for the prayer guide booklet.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,240
 And, you know, this is a great resource for community groups or even by yourself to go through.

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,800
 So, yeah, just check these guys out.

58
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,960
 Thank you.

59
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,280
 - Thank you, Alex.

60
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,200
 Now, Branches of Hope is one of the mission organizations our church partners with.

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,640
 But the other mission organization that we partner with is YWAM Shanti,

62
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,240
 and they're needing our help in their back-to-school drive.

63
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,160
 Now, you can help out in a couple of ways.

64
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,800
 One of the ways is that there are a list of items that you see on the screen right now.

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,440
 Those are items that they need.

66
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,840
 So if you have any of these items at home and you would love...that are in good quality,

67
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,880
 and you would love to share with kids who may need them, these are some of the items

68
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,120
 that you can share.

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,920
 The other thing that you can do to help with this event is you can act as a volunteer.

70
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,480
 So this back-to-school drive happens on August the 27th from 10 to 5.

71
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,440
 So how this works is there will be different time slots where you can serve that day,

72
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,520
 and you can also help distribute some of these items that are donated to kids who

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,320
 need it for their school.

74
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,080
 So if you want to sign up, you can contact Rebecca with that number on the screen right

75
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,240
 now, and you can do that to volunteer or to donate your items there.

76
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,520
 So last year, I had the opportunity to serve at this day, and I thought it was a great

77
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,720
 way to kind of celebrate coming back from school and also to distribute some of these

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,280
 things to kids who need these things.

79
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,640
 Sound good?

80
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
 Good.

81
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:26,240
 Now, moving on to more giving, we also want to move into a time of worship with our giving

82
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,880
 of our finances and our resources.

83
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,240
 So there are now buckets that are going around the room that you may give physically, and

84
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,040
 there are also digital ways that you may give appearing on the screen behind me right now.

85
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,800
 We want to thank you for partnering with us and for your generosity for this church.

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,760
 And yeah, worship is also our way of declaring that we trust in Jesus over our trust in our

87
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,920
 own resources.

88
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,560
 So when the buckets are passed around, I will be back up here to pray for the offering.

89
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:15,480
 Wonderful.

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,480
 Let us pray for the offering.

91
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:26,160
 Father, you have blessed us with much financial blessings, relational blessings, spiritual

92
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
 blessings.

93
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,480
 Lord, we thank you for these things.

94
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,560
 And Jesus, as you have given to us abundantly, we want to humbly bring these back to you

95
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,880
 today.

96
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,080
 You give us out of the overflow of your blessings, and Jesus may we also give out of the overflow

97
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,400
 of our blessings that we have received from you so that we may in turn bless others as

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,480
 well for the further rents of your kingdom here on earth as it is in heaven.

99
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
 And we thank you, Jesus.

100
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,400
 We pray this in your name.

101
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
 Amen.

102
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
 Great.

103
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
 Wonderful.

104
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,280
 Now, right now, I'd like to invite up Pastor Tim for the final time before he goes up for

105
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,000
 his sabbatical.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,880
 That's welcome, Pastor Tim.

107
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,920
 You've heard of practice what you preach, and last time Tim was here, he preached on

108
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
 rest.

109
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,000
 And so, yeah, he's about to go on a bit of a rest.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,360
 Hey, Tim?

111
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,560
 Yeah, so why don't we all stretch our hands and pray for Tim as he closes this sermon

112
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,960
 series, Stewarding Our Lives.

113
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,120
 Father, we are grateful for Tim.

114
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,960
 We're grateful for all the hard work, all the things that he puts into this church,

115
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,320
 all the things that, yeah, we may not notice as your normal person, but Lord, you see everything

116
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,840
 that Tim does, you see everything that he has placed upon this church, and therefore

117
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,080
 now, Jesus, I pray that as he delivers this message, as he closes this series of Stewarding

118
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,040
 Our Lives, Lord, that he may go off into just deep rest with you, Jesus, that he can meet

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,800
 you with you face to face in this rest, Lord, and that as he delivers this final message,

120
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,080
 it's been an important series for many of us as we look into how work is our worship

121
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
 to you.

122
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,000
 And Lord, Jesus, I pray that today as we continue to look into this, Lord, may our

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,960
 work truly be glorifying to you as a form of our worship to you, Jesus.

124
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
 I pray this in your name, Jesus.

125
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
 Amen.

126
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
 Amen.

127
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
 Thank you, Benedict.

128
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
 Let's give Benedict a hand.

129
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
 Yeah.

130
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
 All right.

131
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:40,880
 Well, as Benedict says, final message in the Stewarding Our Lives series, and I'm wondering,

132
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,320
 I don't know about you, but if you've been in church around for a while, it is likely,

133
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:54,880
 it is possible that you've heard of this concept of bringing glory to God through your work.

134
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,040
 So I'm just kind of curious who has heard somebody talk about that.

135
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
 All right.

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,600
 So some people, not everyone.

137
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
 Okay.

138
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
 Good to know.

139
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:09,860
 Now, for me, when I heard this the first time, or as I've heard this a few times in church,

140
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:19,960
 because I was thinking about my work experience, I wasn't quite sure how my work and how, like

141
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,040
 living for God's glory, how that fits together.

142
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,320
 Now, I have to say this was also pre-pastor.

143
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
 Okay.

144
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,480
 But what I really was struggling, like, okay, here's this, I work, but how does it really

145
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,240
 relate to bringing God glory?

146
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,680
 Like, you know, how do these two fit together?

147
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,780
 Because to me, they don't seem like they fit together.

148
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,840
 So for example, there was a season where I was a loan officer.

149
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,800
 Yes, Mr. Officer.

150
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,100
 I really am excited about that name, that title.

151
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,880
 And so what I had to do in that job was, well, for one, sell mortgages to people, but that

152
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:09,200
 involved sitting 1.5 hours on average on the phone, waiting for a phone call to come in.

153
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,680
 Waiting for a warm lead to come in.

154
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,480
 Now, a warm lead is different than cold calling.

155
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,920
 Basically what it involves is somebody already has done the cold calling, and then you get

156
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,640
 the person they found that is looking for a mortgage, that wants to get qualified to

157
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,600
 purchase a home in X amount of price.

158
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,940
 And so waiting for 1.5 hours, like how does that connect with giving glory to God through

159
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,320
 my work?

160
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,640
 Now perhaps when you think about your job, you're also wondering about some of the things

161
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,880
 that you do and how they might connect.

162
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,760
 Maybe it's not waiting for 1.5 hours for a phone call like it was for me.

163
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,460
 But maybe as a parent, you're like, okay, it's 8 a.m. in the morning.

164
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,080
 This is the third time I'm changing my children's clothes.

165
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,080
 Where's the glorifying God in that?

166
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,520
 Or maybe you have another pointless meeting that is on your agenda for the day.

167
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,000
 And you're like, oh, my gosh, here we go again.

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,120
 There's this famous book, it's called Death by Meeting.

169
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,160
 Has anyone ever heard of that?

170
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,760
 Has anyone ever felt that?

171
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,320
 I think we felt that, right?

172
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,120
 I felt that for sure.

173
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,420
 And then it might be maybe there's also this complicated person at work that's just making

174
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,500
 life really difficult.

175
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,400
 And so when you think about your work, it's like, where is God in this work?

176
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,440
 And again, how does this concept of glorifying God and work, how does that all fit together?

177
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:46,800
 Now today in this message, I want to explore with you how we can give God glory through

178
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,120
 our everyday work.

179
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,120
 And I want to explore with you what does that look like?

180
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,360
 How do you actually do that?

181
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,320
 So that's what we're going to unpack in this last message from the sermon series.

182
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,520
 Now I hope that the stewarding our life sermon series has been helpful for you.

183
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,760
 So according to Benedict, it's been helpful for him.

184
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,480
 So that's good.

185
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,200
 But really, our heart has been as we go through these different topics of our work, our calling,

186
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:23,560
 our struggles with work, idolatry in work, restorative justice through work, rest, that

187
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:33,200
 this one life that God has given us, that we can more intentionally, more faithfully

188
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,280
 live that out and pursue that as followers of Jesus.

189
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,280
 And so that's been my prayer and my hope for you.

190
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:47,040
 That this doesn't stop with us talking about it here, but that God is taking you deeper

191
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,640
 into his purposes for you in your everyday life.

192
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
 Amen?

193
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
 Amen.

194
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
 All right.

195
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,240
 So we are today in the book of first Corinthians.

196
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,080
 Today the context is a little bit complicated, so I need a little bit time to set it up for

197
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
 you.

198
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
 Okay.

199
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,760
 So Paul wrote a letter, the apostle Paul wrote a letter to the Corinthian church.

200
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,720
 He planted the church and he received the letter while not being in Corinth anymore.

201
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,360
 And in that letter, the Corinthians, he asked Paul questions that he then in part addresses

202
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,860
 through the letter of first Corinthians.

203
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:30,100
 And so one of those questions has to do with food offered to idols.

204
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,640
 So we have to take a step back and think about like, why did the Corinthians ask a question

205
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,200
 about food offered to idols?

206
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,240
 Well, they lived in a polytheistic environment.

207
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,280
 They lived in a culture, in a town where idol worship was rampant.

208
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,340
 And if you think about their lives, their family life, their social life, all of that

209
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,920
 - their work life as well - involved food.

210
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,440
 But they're also the first generation of Christians, so they don't have Christians who have gone

211
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,160
 before them to give them guidance on what to do.

212
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,720
 And they're actually disagreeing amongst each other on how to think about this.

213
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,580
 And so Paul pastorally speaks into that, and it's actually for a very prolonged time because

214
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:23,160
 it starts in chapter 8 verse 1 and runs all the way to chapter 11 verse 1.

215
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
 Let me read all of it.

216
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
 No, I'm just kidding.

217
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
 Not going to read that much.

218
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:34,680
 But what I want to do is I want to take you to the ending of his argument, where he talks

219
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,320
 about what it means to follow Jesus in this area of your life.

220
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,840
 But at the end of the argument, he also expands it and widens it where it actually applies

221
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,000
 to more.

222
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,760
 So let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 10, starting verse 31, and it says this.

223
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:57,680
 So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.

224
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,420
 Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks, or the church of God, even as I try

225
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,160
 to please everyone in every way.

226
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:14,500
 For I'm not seeking my own good, but the good of many so that they may be saved.

227
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,160
 Follow my example as I follow the example of Christ.

228
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,600
 So let me unpack this for us.

229
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:31,280
 So first we see in verse 31 that Paul talks about, so whatever you eat or drink or whatever

230
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,040
 you do, do it all for the glory of God.

231
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:42,040
 Now eating and drinking is like the most mundane everyday thing, you know, for most of us,

232
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,540
 where it's part of our everyday life.

233
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,980
 And so Paul is talking about everyday life things, but then he expands it, he even says,

234
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:56,020
 or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.

235
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:03,580
 So that means that all our big moments in our day, all our small moments in our day,

236
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:10,740
 everything extraordinary in our day, everything very seemingly very minor are meant and our

237
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:17,740
 possibilities where we can live for the glory of God.

238
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,820
 Now this is different than we often think about it, because a lot of times you think

239
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:29,860
 about it's the big things, the spectacular things where we can live for the glory of

240
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:36,700
 God, you know, when we have an influence on all of society or things like that.

241
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:43,420
 But God, through Paul here, is calling the Corinthian church and everything you do, whatever

242
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,500
 you do, do it for the glory of God.

243
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,460
 And so this really challenges our thinking, because that's not how a lot of us think about

244
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,940
 our daily work.

245
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,820
 That's not how a lot of us think about waiting 1.5 hours on the phone for a phone call to

246
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,580
 be put through.

247
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:10,100
 That's not how a lot of us think about seemingly pointless meetings, right?

248
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:16,100
 And so what Paul is saying to the Corinthians and what he's showing them is that our everyday

249
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:23,340
 life, as boring as it might seem, can be an arena where we can live in such a way that

250
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:28,900
 it brings God glory.

251
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,700
 It means our everyday moments can be a place of worship.

252
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:39,460
 Our everyday moments can be a place where we can experience God's presence, God's power

253
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,900
 at work in our lives.

254
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,220
 Wow.

255
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:49,460
 It's not, again, not usually how we think about those little moments, but this is what

256
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,280
 Paul is saying here.

257
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,060
 So Paul is reframing how they think about these things, and he's also reframing that

258
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,820
 for us.

259
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,300
 But now we need to talk about another part, because it says, "for the glory of God."

260
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,620
 This is also a phrase that people use a lot, but what does that actually mean?

261
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,900
 What does glory of God, what is this actually referring to?

262
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:20,620
 The word that Paul is using here in Greek is "doksa," which means glory and splendor,

263
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,700
 but really underlying his concept is the Hebrew term "kavod."

264
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:35,300
 And kavod means heaviness, weighty, burden, riches, reputation, importance, glory, splendor,

265
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,740
 distinction, honor.

266
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:44,420
 And the idea behind kavod is that it's something important.

267
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,420
 It is weighty.

268
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,580
 It is significant.

269
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:57,100
 And what that means is that God is so awesome because he is creator.

270
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,500
 He's so awesome because of all that he does.

271
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,620
 And when we stand in his presence, there's an impact.

272
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
 We can feel it.

273
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:13,620
 And in Israel, when the temple was built, God, when he filled the temple with his glory,

274
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,200
 with his presence.

275
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,520
 So glory also has to do with God's presence.

276
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,980
 And when we experience God's presence, it is just something that just puts us in awe

277
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,460
 and it's beautiful.

278
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:39,740
 And so when we live for the glory of God, we're showcasing more fully who God is.

279
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,380
 We're making his presence known.

280
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,940
 But I want to actually take you to another verse in the Old Testament from Habakkuk.

281
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,180
 I only know how to say it in German.

282
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,500
 I won't even try in English.

283
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,860
 And Habakkuk, the prophet is saying that the world is heading to a time when there will

284
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,820
 be knowledge of the glory of the Lord.

285
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,220
 So Habakkuk 2, verse 14 says this, "For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of

286
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,980
 the glory of the Lord as waters covers the sea."

287
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,380
 Now what this means is that right now at this point in time, even though God's glory is

288
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:22,320
 everywhere, God is present everywhere, but we are not perceiving it.

289
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,420
 People are not seeing it.

290
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,060
 They're not experiencing it.

291
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,820
 They're not aware of it.

292
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:32,420
 But one day, every person will have knowledge of the glory of the Lord.

293
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
 They will see it.

294
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
 They will perceive it.

295
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,220
 They will experience it.

296
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,380
 St. Benedict talked about the already, but not yet.

297
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:47,020
 You know, so one day everyone will notice when Jesus comes again, when the kingdom is

298
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:54,920
 fully established, his glory, his presence, his beauty, his salvation will be fully known

299
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,180
 and fully visible to everyone.

300
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,740
 To everyone.

301
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:09,420
 Now bringing this back to Paul talking about, "Or whatever you do, do it for the glory of

302
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,540
 God."

303
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:20,620
 So what Paul is talking about here is that we are meant to make visible the things that

304
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,300
 are invisible right now to people, the glory of God.

305
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:29,780
 We're meant to make visible, we're meant to make God visible by how we do our work, how

306
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:35,660
 we relate to others, what we say, and how we conduct our lives.

307
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:46,340
 Know that when we image God, when we live out who we created us to be, we showcase who

308
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,140
 God is, his character, his beauty, his presence.

309
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:58,020
 Our lives, they point beyond us and they point towards God.

310
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:05,260
 And then the earth is starting to be filled more and more with the knowledge of the glory

311
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,820
 of God.

312
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:14,120
 And so when we're talking about bringing God glory in our work, it means we're showcasing

313
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
 who God is.

314
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,060
 We're making him known.

315
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:24,660
 We're making his beauty, his presence more visible to people.

316
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,900
 Because that's what that means.

317
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:36,580
 But Paul, he further characterizes this in verse 33.

318
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,500
 Let me show you.

319
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:47,420
 He says this, "For I'm not seeking my own good, but the good of many so that they may

320
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,660
 be saved."

321
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:59,460
 So bringing God glory has also to do with seeking the good of others, with not just

322
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:06,220
 being focused on ourselves and our own self-interest, but putting the interests of others, having

323
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:12,140
 that impervi, putting that above ourselves for their sake.

324
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:18,820
 That is also a way that people see the beauty, the wonder, and experience the presence of

325
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,020
 God when we do that.

326
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,420
 And Paul modeled that with his life.

327
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,580
 He put others while being first murdered.

328
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,460
 Paul gets this from God, from Jesus.

329
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:40,900
 Philippians 2, right, it talks about that Jesus humbled himself, that he who had all

330
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:50,060
 the glory took on human nature, died on the cross for our sins so that we can be brought

331
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,700
 into the family of God.

332
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,700
 So he humbled himself and he thought of our well-being, of your and mine well-being so

333
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,500
 that we can be forgiven, that we can experience a relationship with God, that we can experience

334
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,340
 restoration, wholeness, healing.

335
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,340
 And he had that in view.

336
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,740
 And so Paul is following his examples.

337
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:26,640
 He wants us to follow his example so that we showcase the beauty of who God is.

338
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:34,660
 And so we do that when you live for God's glory, you live for the good of others.

339
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,900
 So we need to keep others in mind.

340
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,740
 And the Corinthians were not doing that.

341
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,980
 So Paul actually calls them out earlier on that, some of them, where they put their own

342
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,980
 interests first and it impacted others negatively.

343
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,620
 But let's continue.

344
00:23:49,620 --> 00:24:01,140
 He further unpacks how our actions can enhance or also undermine other people's perception

345
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,420
 of who God is.

346
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:09,060
 So in verse 32 and 33 says this, "Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks, or

347
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:15,460
 the church of God, even as I try to please everyone in every way."

348
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,580
 So Paul is not suggesting, when he talks about pleasing everyone in every way, he's not a

349
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,000
 pushover, he's not a doormat that you walk over and can do whatever to.

350
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,140
 But what he's saying is he does not want to act in such a way that anything stands in

351
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:39,420
 the way hinders anyone from coming to know who Jesus is.

352
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:46,020
 From hearing the gospel message, he doesn't want to erect unnecessary barriers.

353
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,340
 He doesn't want that to stand in the way, so he does anything that he can because he's

354
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:56,380
 thinking of others for that not to happen.

355
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,900
 And so our actions and our choices, they can influence whether people are open to the gospel

356
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,940
 message or they can create obstacles.

357
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:11,940
 So how we conduct our work, how we carry ourselves out, it can open up and spark interest and

358
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:18,260
 point towards God, towards his beauty, towards who he is, or it can undermine that.

359
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:27,820
 And sadly, we all have experienced and we all have also done it to one degree or another

360
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:36,700
 where we've hurt others, where we have not enhanced the beauty of who God is through

361
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,660
 our actions.

362
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:47,180
 But Paul is calling us by the grace of God, by his mercy, to continue and to progress

363
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:54,260
 in more and more and more consistently enhancing who God is, showcasing who God is.

364
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:00,380
 And thank God that his grace is so much bigger than our failures, that even though barriers

365
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:10,380
 might have been erect, he can still overcome them because of who he is.

366
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:20,720
 And then finally, Paul is saying, "Imitate me," in verse 11, "as I have imitated Christ."

367
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,620
 So it's again, follow the example of the self-giving love of Jesus.

368
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:32,540
 That is really how you make God's glory known, how you make God visible when you follow that

369
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,980
 pattern.

370
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:42,500
 But it really also speaks to me, could we say, "Follow my example"?

371
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:51,380
 Follow my example at work that I'm currently living out.

372
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,180
 So maybe today there's also a call like, "Wow, what example am I giving?"

373
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,180
 And it's Jesus actually asking me to give a different example than I'm giving right

374
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,700
 now.

375
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,280
 But this brings us all back to how can we bring God's glory through everyday life?

376
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,820
 What does that actually look like?

377
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:14,940
 First we need to see that our daily work can be a place to live for the glory of God.

378
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,820
 A lot of times we have very dismissive attitudes actually towards our work.

379
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,420
 It's a necessary evil to endure.

380
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,140
 You know, I'm just trying to get out of here.

381
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,860
 It's a means to an end, just got to make a living.

382
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,860
 That's it.

383
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
 I don't care about my job.

384
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,260
 You know, it's just a means to an end.

385
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,980
 But if we approach our work in this way, then how can we do whatever we do for the glory

386
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,600
 of God?

387
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,900
 You can't.

388
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,100
 So we need a different mindset.

389
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
 We need a switch.

390
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:54,660
 And so the first thing, if we want to start living that way, we need a switch in our mind.

391
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:01,180
 That our workplace is a place where God is present, where God is at work, and where we

392
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,640
 can give him glory.

393
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,820
 No matter how mundane it seems, no matter how frustrating it is, no matter how difficult

394
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:14,600
 it is, you know, it is a place where God is at work and where we can give him glory through

395
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,240
 how we engage in that place.

396
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,380
 So that's the first thing.

397
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:26,560
 Now the second thing is we glorify God through what we do and how we do it.

398
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:37,500
 Now what we do, of course there are a few jobs that don't glorify God.

399
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,140
 For example, if you're a loan shark and you're giving out predatory loans to people who are

400
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:47,140
 in need and then they're not able to pay them back and you just keep them in debt perpetually,

401
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,560
 you know, if you're in that type of job, you need a quickie job.

402
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:57,140
 And so you need to discern, is your job a type of job that brings God glory just in

403
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,500
 its very own nature?

404
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,600
 But in the first message of the series, we talked about, you know, that we are created

405
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,400
 in the image of God.

406
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,740
 And that part of what it means to be created in the image of God means to be cultivators,

407
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:17,520
 needs to be workers, that co-labor with God, that do creative work like God does creative

408
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,660
 work that create culture, that do beautiful things, that make pieces of art, that organize

409
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:30,380
 things that are not organized, that advance his project.

410
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:40,300
 And when we focus on contributing to the flourishing of the world in general and the people specifically,

411
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,860
 you know, that brings God's glory.

412
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:48,700
 And it doesn't matter if your job is a loan officer or if it's a pastor or whatever it

413
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:57,660
 may be, just by doing your job and serving people through it, you know, you are bringing

414
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,840
 God glory.

415
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,020
 So that's the first thing.

416
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:07,860
 But then the second thing, and I think this signifies how we do our work.

417
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:15,340
 So when I was a loan officer, I could have like, "Ugh, hour and a half," you know, and

418
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,900
 then complain to my next, not next door, I guess, next best neighbor.

419
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:25,300
 And we could just chit-chat the whole time and just see how miserable, you know, the

420
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,340
 work is.

421
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,860
 But if I choose to have a positive attitude about what I do, it's okay, I'm waiting, maybe

422
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,540
 I can do some paperwork, I can do some other things.

423
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,780
 I encourage my co-workers when we do chit-chat, you know, try to listen to them, lift them

424
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,020
 up, encourage them.

425
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
 I work hard.

426
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,100
 You know, Christians really should be known for people who work hard, who do excellent

427
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:57,900
 work, that every employer wants to hire Christians because of how they carry themselves.

428
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:05,500
 And so when we do that, when we really seek to honor God through how we manage all these

429
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:11,900
 little details, how we deal with conflict in the work, you know, we give God glory.

430
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:19,900
 And God, his beauty and who he is, is revealed to those around us.

431
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,140
 We are making God visible in our workplace.

432
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:32,860
 Now, I want to invite up Esther, so let's give Esther a warm welcome.

433
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:40,620
 So Esther has been a part of our church community since we planted, and her husband Enoch is

434
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,220
 also one of the elders here, and she has two beautiful children.

435
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,400
 And so we're so grateful to have you here today, and she's going to be sharing with

436
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:53,740
 us about her processing, her thinking about the glory of God and what that means through

437
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
 our work.

438
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
 So thank you.

439
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,740
 Thank you, Tim.

440
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,740
 Thank you for inviting me.

441
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,940
 So hi, everyone.

442
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,780
 So when I first started working, I was quite eager to serve God.

443
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:11,180
 And that several years, I keep asking, "Hey, God, what can I do for you?

444
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,900
 And how can I bring glory to your name?"

445
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:21,740
 And for me, myself, I love art, and I heard about there is a one-year ministry program

446
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,820
 that using art to help people building God's community.

447
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,180
 So I jumped in at the chance.

448
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:36,540
 So it sounds very exciting, but at the same time, saying yes was not easy for me.

449
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:44,100
 For that time, I had to quit my job and quite a steady income, and my boyfriend, not quitting

450
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
 him, just leaving him.

451
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,140
 He's now my husband.

452
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:52,700
 And everything familiar.

453
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:58,900
 And I remember I still need to raise my own salary for that whole year.

454
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:04,140
 And so I remember once I arrived, I was quite struggled.

455
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:11,580
 It was like speaking different language and feeling out of place and even small things

456
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,340
 like cockroaches.

457
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:19,860
 I have to face it alone, so I feel stretched in every way.

458
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:26,980
 So at the end of that year, I sat down with a mentor to reflect the whole experience.

459
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,400
 And during our prayer, I had a very clear vision that God gave me.

460
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:39,780
 And he said, I saw myself sitting on his shoulder, and he was so big.

461
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,660
 And just like he was standing there and showing me the city.

462
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,820
 We were looking out over the city.

463
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,820
 And it felt like God showing me.

464
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,460
 He even like hold me and show me, this is what I did.

465
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,580
 And what he had been doing all along, like his work and his glory.

466
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,140
 And then I was so excited.

467
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,580
 Like in that picture, I was so excited.

468
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,940
 I was very joyful.

469
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:16,780
 And I sense him saying that, even if you do nothing, I still love you.

470
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,940
 So to be honest, I think this is comforting for everyone.

471
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,980
 But at that time, I was upset.

472
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,300
 Hey, I thought, what do you mean?

473
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:33,140
 Like I have given up so much to be here.

474
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:40,460
 But over time, I realized God was not trying to dismiss my effort, but he was inviting

475
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:48,220
 me to slow down, to notice and to appreciate what he was already doing.

476
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:55,620
 He wanted me to witness his work and just focus, but not just focusing on my work, like

477
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,980
 it's his work.

478
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:04,540
 So fast forward to this summer, now I'm working as a therapist.

479
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:12,100
 And when I know that I'm invited to share, and I think God reminded of this story, like

480
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:18,980
 one of my former teenage clients, and I have her consent to share her, like just part of

481
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,500
 her story.

482
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,180
 And she had been struggled for a year with self-harm.

483
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:32,340
 And she went through deep emotional struggles and breakdowns because of an abusive home

484
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:37,780
 and how she spent years unable to attend school.

485
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:44,900
 So this year on DSE result day, you know, usually it's the mid of July.

486
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,980
 For your information, DSE is the Hong Kong public exam that helping you to get into the

487
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,300
 universities.

488
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:59,700
 And I didn't expect anything from her, but she surprisingly sent me a message that she

489
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:05,300
 told me she doesn't even like able to attend school.

490
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:12,340
 She even attend all the exams and complete the prep-tech examination with every subject

491
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,620
 passed.

492
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,060
 And she's so proud of herself.

493
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,740
 Yeah, I really want to give her a hand.

494
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,220
 She's so proud of herself finding strength to live again.

495
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,500
 That's what exact wording she said to me.

496
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,540
 And when I received her message, I was deeply moved.

497
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:38,180
 And because I witnessed her journey, like at that moment, I feel like, oh, I have a

498
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:45,300
 glimpse of the precious, beautiful strength of God had placed in her, like shining through

499
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:51,060
 all the brokenness she had faced and perhaps she's still facing.

500
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:58,540
 And that moment brought me to pause and simply be in awe of God's glory.

501
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:05,740
 And on that result day, there are so many people looking for top grades, like big achievement.

502
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:13,300
 I think those are also glory, but sometimes I think God's glory also shines through in

503
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:19,180
 this ordinary, like in this quiet moment of hope and strength.

504
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:25,900
 So yeah, I think in the whole process, I'm remind glorifying God is just doing, about

505
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,940
 doing more, achieving higher.

506
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,340
 I think there's no comparison is needed.

507
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,580
 Everyone is different.

508
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:40,420
 And sometimes it's just about pausing long enough to recognize God's presence and His

509
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,140
 work in every day.

510
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:48,780
 So I hope we can all catch a glimpse of His glory even in the ordinary.

511
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,780
 Thank you.

512
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,780
 Wonderful.

513
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:58,940
 Thank you so much for sharing Esther.

514
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:05,140
 I want to pick up on one of the things that Esther said.

515
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,140
 And, you know, it's easy.

516
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,220
 She was sharing about her own experience of trying to give God glory and then God, you

517
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,940
 know, putting her on her shoulder and showing her.

518
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,460
 And that He just wanted her to see what He was doing.

519
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:27,100
 Like now, of course, she can glorify God, but at that moment, He just also wanted her

520
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:34,540
 to enjoy the work that God was already doing and to behold His beauty and not to miss that

521
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:39,500
 herself as we're striving, you know, and are so focused on giving God glory.

522
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:46,620
 And I think that's really important that, yes, whatever you do, do it for the glory

523
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,020
 of God, but don't miss God in it.

524
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
 Right?

525
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,420
 See what He's doing, experience His presence, see His beauty, celebrate it, see it in other

526
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,980
 people's lives.

527
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:07,700
 And it was interesting as I was thinking about giving God glory, I really have come to believe

528
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:13,140
 that a lot of times it's actually in the small, everyday, mundane things that we glorify God

529
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,140
 the most.

530
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,620
 And I want to explain that a little bit.

531
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,500
 First of all, there usually is no other agenda.

532
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:26,740
 Like we're not trying to build a reputation for ourselves when it's a small, mundane thing.

533
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,660
 We're just doing it because we love God and we're loving the people around us.

534
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:39,380
 And so there's a pureness in that, in these small, everyday moments when we choose to

535
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:46,340
 give God glory, when we choose to do work well, when we choose to be patient with somebody.

536
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:54,660
 You know, these little things, they really honor Him and give Him praise.

537
00:39:54,660 --> 00:40:03,740
 And I was praying about myself, like, "God, how have I given you glory through my work?"

538
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,080
 And beforehand, I'll be honest, I thought about, I'll probably say something about the

539
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:14,100
 church plant, maybe about a sermon that especially seemed to have hit home.

540
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:19,580
 But actually, as I was praying, the things that the Holy Spirit brought to my mind were

541
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,820
 the behind the scene moments.

542
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:30,020
 It's like when I chose to obey God when nobody was watching, that He was glorified through

543
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,020
 that.

544
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:37,860
 I had to think of one particular instance.

545
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:48,940
 And I'm not going to share much detail about this, but basically, I was entitled to something.

546
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,380
 And I was praying over that, whether or not to do that.

547
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:59,100
 And as I was praying, God spoke to me about that if I do that, it would impact other people

548
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,940
 negatively, even though I wasn't entitled to it.

549
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,700
 And I had people in my life cheering me on, "Oh, you should do it.

550
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,580
 It's yours."

551
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:16,620
 But I chose not to do it, which was very hard and came also at quite a high cost.

552
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,340
 And only a few people know what this was about.

553
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,780
 Some Christians, some not Christian.

554
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:29,460
 But that was the moment where I really felt God's joy and delight over me, that I glorified

555
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,540
 Him through what I did.

556
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:39,940
 And it wasn't those behind the scenes, small moments, that He shapes us and molds us into

557
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:46,780
 people who reflect His character, who broadcast His beauty, who make visible through how we

558
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:52,140
 love, how we treat others, how we live our lives.

559
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,340
 And that's what those everyday moments are.

560
00:41:54,340 --> 00:42:01,700
 If you're not giving God glory in those everyday little moments, you're missing out on this

561
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,820
 work that God wants to do in you and through you.

562
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:10,900
 You're missing out on who God wants you to be and who He wants to shape you to be.

563
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,380
 You're missing out on growing big people.

564
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:20,820
 On imaging Him more fully, His character, His likeness.

565
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,340
 And so as I was thinking about bringing God glory through our work, I really felt like

566
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:30,460
 that this was God's invitation to us here today as a church.

567
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:38,980
 That He is inviting you or calling you back to give God glory in those small, everyday,

568
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:46,260
 mundane moments that maybe don't seem big, but that God will work through it, that He

569
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:53,220
 will make Himself known, that the knowledge of the glory of God will increase because

570
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:59,940
 you everyday faithfully are choosing to bring Him glory, whether somebody's watching or

571
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,940
 not.

572
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
 And guess what?

573
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:07,500
 When those supposedly big moments come, because of what you've been doing, you're that type

574
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,100
 of person who will bring God glory.

575
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,640
 Because that's the trajectory you're on.

576
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,900
 And that's what He is calling to and inviting you to.

577
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,420
 I want to invite the worship team to come up.

578
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:29,580
 I had the, sorry, I need to blow my nose.

579
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,460
 Yeah, I do.

580
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:42,380
 I had to sense that some of us, maybe like Esther, we had this gung-ho phase in our lives.

581
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,380
 We're like, "I'm going to live and work for the glory of God."

582
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:53,180
 But for whatever reason, that somehow got lost along the way.

583
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:58,980
 And I just sensed that today God wants to invite you to renew your heart, to restore

584
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:08,140
 your heart, to not be cynical, to not underestimate what He wants to do through small and mundane

585
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,140
 moments.

586
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:13,980
 So I want to invite you to stand.

587
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:21,420
 And I would love to pray for you.

588
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:28,380
 And if that's a desire of your heart, you're like, "Lord, I just want to give you glory

589
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,860
 through those small, mundane, everyday moments."

590
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,900
 Just as a symbol of that, it's like, "Here I am again," or, "Here I am for the first

591
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,900
 time.

592
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,900
 I never thought about it."

593
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,740
 I just want to invite you to stretch out your hand before you.

594
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,620
 I would love to pray over you.

595
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:57,180
 Jesus, I thank you so much that you have created us and that you've called us to be people

596
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:08,980
 who love like you love, who showcase your character so that others who don't know you

597
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:15,780
 can just see how beautiful, how amazing, how incredible you are.

598
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:22,980
 And I thank you for every heart right now that is expressing, "Lord, I want to serve

599
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,460
 you."

600
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,100
 I don't care if it's like the big moments or if it's the small moments.

601
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,880
 I just want to bring you glory.

602
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,020
 I just want to honor you, whether people are watching or not.

603
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:47,020
 And Lord, and so I pray that you will powerfully make yourself visible in everyone's life,

604
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,740
 that we can see you in our workplace.

605
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:54,620
 Maybe we can see you in those places that we felt like are just mundane and dumb and

606
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:59,860
 we just want to get away from them, but that they actually are places where you are at

607
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:04,980
 work, at work in our lives and at work in other people's lives.

608
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,580
 And so Lord, so we surrender and we say, "Holy Spirit, come.

609
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,020
 Will you fill our hearts?

610
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,900
 Will you renew our hearts?

611
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,900
 We've grown old.

612
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,420
 We've grown cynical.

613
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,220
 We've given up.

614
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,220
 Will you restore us?

615
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:24,820
 Will you do a new thing?"

616
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:31,820
 And Lord, I pray now over everyone that as we go out this week, as we choose to bring

617
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:38,380
 you glory in the small little things every day, that because of that, you will make yourself

618
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,740
 known, that you will shine brightly through this community, that more people will come

619
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:51,060
 to knowledge of your glory because you have faithful followers of you just loving you

620
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:56,180
 in the little things, loving you in the behind the scenes things.

621
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:02,460
 And so we offer our lives to you, Jesus, we say, "Use us for your glory."

622
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,980
 And church, we all say to this in Jesus' name, amen.

623
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,980
 Amen.

624
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,500
 Thank you.

625
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
