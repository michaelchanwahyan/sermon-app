1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
 Hello everybody, good morning. I'm so happy to be here to share with what God has put into my heart today.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,500
 And first of all, I'd like to show you one of my most treasured letters that I have received.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,500
 This letter is from my late father, who wrote to me when I was around 14 years old.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,500
 He moved back to Hong Kong six months before my mother and I could move back to Hong Kong

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
 because he needed to start work early.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,500
 And so at that time, my mom and I were in New Zealand, and he was back in Hong Kong.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 So at the beginning of the letter, he talked about how summer was like in Hong Kong

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,000
 and what he did during the day and the routine stuff.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,500
 But towards the end of the letter, he would often tell me what to do

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,000
 and what you need to do to help my mom out and all those things.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,500
 It is because that he has us in mind when he was writing the letter.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,500
 And I'm sure that when you are writing, I don't know if you've been writing letters now,

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
 but when you're writing a lengthy email or a letter,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 you especially want to pour out all you want to do and all you have at the very end.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
 And so this is the heart of this letter.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
 If you just take the last part of my dad's letter out,

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,500
 you would just see him telling me to turn off the lights, close the window, and be alert.

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
 And it's all the things that you need to do.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,000
 But actually, the heart of the letter is that he wants us to be safe, and he misses us,

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 and he wants us to be there with him.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And so this is what the letter of Galatians is like as well.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 If you just take apart the letter part, the last part of the Galatians,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,500
 you would see that all is full of things that Paul would like us to do,

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500
 remind us about the rules and all those things.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,000
 But actually, what he said in the beginning set a tone,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,500
 set the heart of what this letter is about.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,000
 And so at the very end, he's pouring his heart out,

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 because it is towards the end of the letter.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 He wants to make sure that everyone in the church understands

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 and is able to do what his reminders are.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,500
 And so we're reading the last part of the letter today.

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,000
 And Paul began by the letter, the whole letter,

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 by straightening up what is the true gospel.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 The gospel, as known as the good news,

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 is not about what you do to become a Jew so that you could be accepted in Christ.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 The good news is that Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 and becoming a curse for us.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 So in Christ Jesus, you're all children of God through faith.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And all of you who are baptized into Christ have clothed yourself in Christ.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And it is for freedom that God has set you free.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And because you are his sons, God sent the spirit of his son into our lives.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And isn't that powerful?

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 When we believe in Jesus, we have the Holy Spirit inside of us.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 The Holy Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is living inside of you.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 He who leads you to the truth, who empowers you to do good work,

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 and heals and transforms your life is living inside of you.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And what does that look like?

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Well, Pastor Tim last week told us that it would look like a fruit tree.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 It does sound like a little bit funny to talk about, "Oh, it looks like a fruit tree."

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 But think about it.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 If you see apples on a tree, you know that it's an apple tree.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 If you see bananas on a tree, you know that it is a banana tree.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And when people see that what you do is full of love,

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 that you have peace and you make peace,

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 and that there's faithfulness and gentleness in the way that you connect with people,

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 they know that there is something inside of you that is different,

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 and that is the Holy Spirit in you.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 We do things in love.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 We treat others with gentleness and are faithful.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 We do all of that not because we want to earn brownie points.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 We do all of that because we are transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit,

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 which leads us to live a godly life.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And so what does that look like when a group of Spirit-led people come together?

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 This is what we're focusing on today in Galatians chapter 6.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 So let us read those first together.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 In Galatians chapter 6, verse 1, it says,

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin,

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently."

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Thank you for reading.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 It's inevitable in a group to work together and be together without conflict,

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 especially we know that we are full of faults, full of weaknesses, right?

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Paul knows that well.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And so instead of saying, "Brothers and sisters, those who live by the Spirit,

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 you need to correct the others," he uses the word "restore."

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 The word "restore" means to put back in order or to repair.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 It is the word that uses for setting a fractured bone.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 We have to put the broken one back together like a doctor would do.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 So recently I've noticed that I have pain in a lot of areas because--

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 well, if you've noticed carefully in the letter, you could guess I'm not a teenager anymore.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 But I've noticed that I have pains in my arms, and I was wondering,

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 "Why was my arm hurting?"

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So instead of telling my arm, "Don't hurt anymore,"

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 I need to find out why my arm is hurting, what kind of pain is it telling me.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Is it a muscle pain? Is it a joint pain? Is it a pain because I was carrying a lot of stuff?

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 The way to restore my body, first of all, is to listen and to notice the pain

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 and then to understand what causes it and then to provide treatment.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And so when Paul said that if someone is caught in sin,

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 if we notice that someone in our community is not acting right,

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 we should restore that person.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 He's saying that if this community is spirit-led,

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 we are not to cut off that person from our community.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 We're not to condemn them and say, "You're not acting right.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 You can't be in this community anymore."

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 But what we need to do is we need to listen to their pain

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 and understand what causes it and to give it treatment.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Let me give you an example.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 When I was a teacher, I came across a very bright kid.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 He knows everything very quickly and he understands things very quickly,

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 but he's also the first person to point out where my mistakes are.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 He's always the first person to go, "Hey, that is not fair,"

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 and he would laugh at the person who is making those mistakes.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 It was not a very good behavior. We don't desire it.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 But I want to investigate what causes that.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And so I asked the parents, like, you know,

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 "What happened to this person? What happened to this kid?"

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And I did a little bit of observation.

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And I noticed that the way that he acts is not because he's a naughty kid.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 It was because he was lonely.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 He did not know how to connect with his classmate.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 When he said, "It's not fair," when he said that,

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 "Oh, he did something wrong," he noticed that his other classmate

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 would join him to laugh at that person

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 or to do something that is not right or to, you know, act out together.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And in that way, he felt that he was connected.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And so the way that he was doing, the things that he was saying

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 was not because he was a naughty kid.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 It was his cry of loneliness.

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 It is sometimes true for us too.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 When there is a hurt or a pain, we want to give it a quick fix.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Maybe we want to scroll our phone for 3 or 4 hours at night.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Maybe we want to go shopping.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Maybe we want to watch something that we're not supposed to watch or read.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 We do all of us to numb that pain away,

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 to hide that thing that's hurting us.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 And we do that so that we don't have to face the pain or the loneliness

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 or the trouble that was troubling us.

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 So back to my student.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Instead of telling him off, I started to praise him

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 for the slightest thing that he did well.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Maybe he just tucked his feet under his desk,

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 and I go, "That's a very considerate thing to do."

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Maybe he was just trying to do things that was easy for himself,

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 but I would make sure that he understands,

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 "I notice that you're doing well today, and I praise you for it."

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I started to give him class chores

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 that requires him to connect with other students.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And in doing so, he noticed that, "Oh, the way that I am doing now,

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 the way that I'm connecting with my classmates now,

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 it's a good thing.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I'm still connecting. I can make friends.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And yet I'm helping the school as well."

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And so not only he stopped those undesirable behavior,

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 he helped me to lead the class to cooperate with me.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 So as we gather in church,

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 do we make an effort to notice those that are in need?

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Do we notice those who are hurting in our community?

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And who can we connect with to restore?

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 And the fact is, sometimes we are the one who needs to be restored.

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 No one can be sure that they can stay strong and perfect forever.

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 We need a loving community,

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 a community that we can trust to give us direction

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 and to tell us the truth that sets us free.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 So not only are we to reach out,

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 it is equally important for us to let people in.

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And I know how challenging it is

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 to stay behind a little bit longer after service.

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I know it is tiring and draining to start all those small talks

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 at the beginning of a relationship or a friendship.

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 I know that because I've experienced it before.

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Before I come to this church, before I go to any churches,

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I went to a church in Fanling,

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 and it took me three years to let me feel at ease at that community.

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Three years. That's 52 weeks times three.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 It was hard. I mean, to step into a church where I know no one

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 and I feel like I don't belong,

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 and to know that maybe that person doesn't want to talk to me,

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 maybe I was not good enough to talk to that person.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 It was very tough for me to reach out and to talk to those people.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 So I know how challenging it is.

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 However, Paul encouraged us to connect,

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 how our body connects together.

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 As we live a spirit-led life, we are to be connected

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 so that if we fall into sin, we have people that know us,

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 we have people that we trust to hear the cries of our heart

175
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 and to be restored.

176
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 So I encourage you to stay behind at the church today.

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 There's a bring-your-own-lunch today that is a fantastic opportunity

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 for us just to eat, share a meal, and talk to people

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 that is in the same community as you are.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 A spirit-led life leads you to a spirit-led community.

181
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 In some ways, you can't be loving on your own.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 God doesn't give you love so that you can love the four walls of the church.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 But He gives you love so that you could pour into the people

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 that are sitting next to you.

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 You can pour into the body of Christ.

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Therefore, that's why in the second verse, Paul continues his thought

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 by saying that, "Carry each other's burden, and in this way,

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 you will fulfill the law of Christ.

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 If anyone thinks there's something when there are not,

190
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 they deceive themselves."

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And what is the law of Christ?

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 In Galatians 5:14, Paul said, "For the entire law is fulfilled

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 in keeping this one commandment."

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Love your neighbor as yourself.

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Love your neighbor as yourself.

196
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And I hope that when you come into church today,

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 you know who your neighbors are.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 In the story of the Good Samaritans, Jesus has told us who our neighbors are.

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 The neighbors are the person that sits next to you.

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 The neighbor is the person God opens your eyes to notice.

201
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Your neighbor is the one that God has put into your heart and say,

202
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 "I remember this person.

203
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I know God has placed me in this church for a reason and for a matter

204
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 because there's someone that God wants me to love on, to connect with.

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 That this person sitting next to me is not a chore for me to connect with him.

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 It is because God has put this person next to me in my life

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 so that when I'm in need, when I have burdens in my heart,

208
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 when I'm carrying heavy stuff, I can reach out to someone that I know."

209
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 God wants you to open up your heart and to let people in.

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 And I said that I was an introvert.

211
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 It took me three years to feel at ease at that church, and I finally did.

212
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And it's not because of a miracle.

213
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 It's not because suddenly I wake up one day and go, "God, I'm ready now.

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Finally, I feel I'm happy.

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 I feel like an extrovert, and I can go and connect at this church."

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 No, it was because I was in that community,

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 and the people sitting next to me, my peers, they were relentless,

218
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 and they were persistent.

219
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 No matter how many times I've rejected them and said no to meals and gatherings,

220
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 they still invite me.

221
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 They still come up to me and say, "Jun, I want you to be here.

222
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 I know that you'll feel loved here.

223
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Don't leave. Don't go to the door. Stay away from the door."

224
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And that has helped me to be connected.

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 They saw me, and they reached out to me.

226
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And so I was in that church for over 10 years when God led me to the Vine.

227
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I was a different person then.

228
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I was able to go to a new church alone and start to make friends

229
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 because I know that I'm loved back at my family church.

230
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I still remember the day when I set foot in the Vine Church in Wan Chai.

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 In a room full of people, I felt like I'm ready to head back out again.

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 But the love I've received reminded me that I am worthy,

233
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 that there will be people who wanted to be friends with me.

234
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And with that thought in mind, I stayed.

235
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And when you see me now talking and reaching out to people,

236
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 it's not because I can.

237
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 It was because the spirit that gives me joy, the strength, and the boldness

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 helped me through it.

239
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 And don't wait for that feeling to come.

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Because when we say in the Galatian that we believe and we trust in the God

241
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 that loves you and sees you, that you've got to trust that He will provide you

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 with the people that reaches out to you.

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And so you need to step out before you have the feeling.

244
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And that is the trust and faith that God is calling us to be in.

245
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And so let's read verse 2 and verse 5 together.

246
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 "Carry others' burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves.

248
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Each one should test their own actions, then they can take pride in themselves

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 alone, without comparing themselves to someone else,

250
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 for each one should carry their own load."

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Paul assumes that the Galatians will have burdens.

252
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Burdens are unavoidable.

253
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 They may come in the form of mental illnesses or physical illnesses,

254
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 financial crisis, addictions, or family issues.

255
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 But one thing for sure, no one will escape the feeling of weight of such problem.

256
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Because Jesus said, "You will have suffering in this world."

257
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Paul not only assumes that we have burdens, but that we cannot carry all of our own burden.

258
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Certainly, we must first cast our burdens onto our God,

259
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 because He knows it and He will sustain us.

260
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And of course, Jesus bore our burdens on the cross when He died for us in our place.

261
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 But we are also instructed to share our trials and struggles with other believers.

262
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 The ministry of burden-bearing is not just a suggestion that you can,

263
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 if you don't want it, you don't have to.

264
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 It's not a suggestion.

265
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 It is not reserved for pastors.

266
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 To be an obedient Christian, operating under the control of the Spirit,

267
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 you must help others carry their burdens.

268
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And this is what it meant to love, and this is what it meant to be church.

269
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 I think it needs no explanation when we want to help others with carrying burdens.

270
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 We can think of many ways to help, as small as setting the room up for church events,

271
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 or a meal for people who need time to rest and heal,

272
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 running errands for single parents, and all of these are important and necessary.

273
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 But there are also intangible ways that we can carry each other's burden.

274
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 When I was in Australia, I had to share a room with three other girls.

275
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 One of the girls had a hard time keeping her room tidy.

276
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 A lot of parents could run a song with that.

277
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 My daughter is like that too.

278
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 My spouse is like that too.

279
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 But actually, that was a little bit extreme.

280
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Her room was messy to the point that we can't walk in her room.

281
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And it was a burden.

282
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 It was a burden for her, and we could go, "Hey, you know, tidy up your room and just leave it at that."

283
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 But many years later, she shared with us that the way that we helped her

284
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 was actually not helping her to clean her room.

285
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 If we actually do that, she'll feel that she's not good enough.

286
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 The way we support her was just to sit down and talk to her and hear her problem.

287
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 The way we help her was to accept that, "Oh, you have an issue that you need to deal with."

288
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 It was not because physically you can't do it, but something was burdening in your heart,

289
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 and I know that you can't do it not because you don't want to.

290
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And so she shared with us, because we're doing that, she felt accepted and she was motivated.

291
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And that acceptance we gave her, the listening ears when she is able to talk,

292
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 helped her and encouraged her to do the next step.

293
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 So some can help physically, but some can also help by giving time,

294
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 and all of us could do something to help carry each other's burden.

295
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And we should do it as a community, each doing what we're able to do

296
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 and share the joy as we serve one another.

297
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And I can see how someone looking at this verse and go,

298
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 "Oh, don't these two verses contradict for themselves?

299
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 One says, 'Carry each other's burden,' and the other said, 'You need to carry your own load.'

300
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Doesn't those two verses contradict each other?"

301
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 But the Greek text helps it here.

302
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 The two different words for burden are used in these two verses.

303
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Paul uses the term 'barrels' in verse 2.

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 We can look at the next slide.

305
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Paul uses the term 'barrels' in verse 2, meaning a weight or a heavy load,

306
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 but he uses the word 'photion' in verse 5, referring to a soldier's backpack.

307
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 The meaning is clear, that some things in life are so heavy that we cannot bear them alone.

308
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Other matters in life are the equivalent of what you might carry in a backpack.

309
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 So which one is which?

310
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Which of the things I'm carrying is a burden that I can share with others?

311
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 And what are some of the loads that I have to carry that is my responsibility?

312
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Well, I can give you two examples to see if you can discern these two.

313
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 The first one, a single parent who's trying to make his or her own end meet,

314
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 and the kid falls ill and needs someone to take him to the doctor.

315
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 And the second example is that a single parent who's also trying to make ends meet,

316
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 but bought a luxurious item and is using his money irresponsibly.

317
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And we go, "Oh, I know, the first one is a burden,

318
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 and the second one is the load that she or he needs to take up responsibility and put his act together."

319
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 But however, life is not as clear-cut as that.

320
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Remember when I mentioned that our action was a reflection of our hearts?

321
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 We see the action of spending recklessly.

322
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 We make a judgment and say that this is a load that this person needs to carry.

323
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 However, without getting to know that person or listen to this person well,

324
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 we might dismiss the fact that this action is a cry from something that is happening in the heart.

325
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 He or she needs to carry the load of making wise financial decisions,

326
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 but we should help carry the burden of what is happening internally

327
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 by getting to know that person and listening to that person.

328
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 There is a scene at the end of the film version of Tolkien's book, Return of the King.

329
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Has anyone watched that movie before, The Return of the King?

330
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 It was a really good movie.

331
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Frodo, who was close to completing the task of dropping the evil ring in the fire.

332
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Once the evil ring is dropped in the fire, it is destroyed, the whole drama is finished,

333
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 he's about to do that, but he was too tired and too worn to walk up the mountain.

334
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 And so his loyal friend Sam says with tears and passion,

335
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 "Come, Mr. Frodo, I can't carry the ring for you, but I can carry you."

336
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 He proceeds to help him up the mountain so Frodo can end the drama once and for all.

337
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Spirit-led believers help the brothers and sisters carry the burden that crushed them.

338
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 This is the picture that Paul is trying to paint for what it is like to be a spirit-led community.

339
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 There is no place for condemnation.

340
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 We are here to restore.

341
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 We're not here to be independent individuals.

342
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 We are called to walk together, support each other, and point each other to Christ.

343
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 And if that is the picture Paul is painting and telling us what it is like to be a spirit-led community,

344
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 are we allowing ourselves to be in one?

345
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Are we willing to call this place our home church?

346
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Are we willing to take root not only in the Word of God, but also the people that God has placed us in?

347
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Paul then--Jesus then told us in the Last Supper on earth,

348
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 He said, "Love one another as I have told you, so that you must--so you must love one another.

349
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 By this, everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."

350
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Let us be known by the way we love.

351
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Let us be a spirit-led community by the way we allowed us to be known and known,

352
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 and to serve and to be served.

353
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And I'd like to welcome the worship team back to the stage,

354
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 and I would like you to participate to demonstrate what God has been speaking to you.

355
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Could you all stand up?

356
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Let's pray.

357
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Dear Father, we thank you that you have put a spirit in our heart.

358
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 We thank you that in all the worries and burdens and turbulations in this world,

359
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 you have given us an anchor in our heart.

360
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And so that when things are happening on the inside, we can be sure that we have you.

361
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And we thank you that because you are with us, that we know that we are seen and we are heard.

362
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And so Lord, I just bring up all the burdens that this community is carrying right now.

363
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Whether in life you are carrying the burden of a financial decision,

364
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 or you are carrying the burden of family members, or sickness,

365
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 or someone that is bothering you in your mind.

366
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And I just pray that these burdens, we are going to lift them up together

367
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 through our prayers, through our worship.

368
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Our worship is not the singing of voices as Chapman was saying earlier.

369
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Our worship was our faith singing to you.

370
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 That we know that the burdens here is actually something that you can carry.

371
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 You are bigger than the burdens that we are carrying.

372
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 You are bigger and higher and more loving than the burdens and the troubles that are worrying us.

373
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And so we lift them all up to you.

374
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Father, I pray that as we come together to worship you, we come together to pray with each other.

375
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 That the Spirit that you have given us is going to help us to lead into a Spirit led community.

376
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 That we are not coming here to make friends.

377
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 We are here to come to be brothers and sisters in Christ.

378
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 We are coming over here to know that we are a body of Christ.

379
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 That if one body hurts, we know and we see and we notice.

380
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 That when we come together, we are able to listen to each other and pray for each other.

381
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Knowing that the Christ in us is going to listen to our prayer and answer.

382
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 That the burden that we are carrying that is crushing us, we can share with the person that is reaching out next to us.

383
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Father, I pray that it is hard to build community.

384
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 It is hard to make friends.

385
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 But nothing is hard in your eyes.

386
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Nothing is hard in the Spirit of God.

387
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And so I pray for this community that anyone that feels timid, that anyone has been hurt before,

388
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 that you are going to lift up those worries, that you are going to remove those bad experiences.

389
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Give us a fresh, your Spirit, so that we are able to reach out once again.

390
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 That there is new relationship starting in this community.

391
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 That we are going to see each other as brothers and sisters.

392
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 That we will listen and we'll know that you are with us.

393
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 That your love is our bond between each other.

394
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I pray for a sense of security in this place.

395
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 I pray a blessing over this place.

396
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 That you are with us.

397
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
