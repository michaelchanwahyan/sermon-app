[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Everybody says, amen.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Hey, can we thank our worship team as always?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Amazing, amazing.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Come on in.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   There are some people standing.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   We do have a few seats.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Here in the front, there's about three or four seats.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   So if anybody's standing, come, come, come.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   No one's looking at you, don't worry.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Actually, everybody's looking at you.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   It's okay, just come.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Come, come, come, come.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   I need about four people, three people, four people.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Come grab a seat, please.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   My man, God is dope.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Come with me, come here, come here.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   What's up, man?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   God is dope, baby.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   God is dope.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   There we go.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   All right, all right, cool.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   My seat is also available.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Anybody else need a seat?
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Lovely lady here.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Hi, how are you?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Come on in.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   This is the anointed seat.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   It's because you're next to Jess.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   There you go, have a seat.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   All right, welcome to the Vine.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   My name's Andrew.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   If you're new here, we're so glad you're here.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I want to address the elephant on my face, which is the massive lip that I currently have,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   and the big blister on my lip.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I thought if I don't address this at the start, you'll all wonder what happened to me.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   So let me tell you the story.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I've just come back from New Zealand.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I just had a short holiday in New Zealand.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And whilst I was in New Zealand, I went swimming with dolphins.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And swimming with dolphins is amazing.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And I'm out there in the ocean.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I'm swimming with these incredible dolphins.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   They're baby dolphins with us.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And the baby dolphins are super cute.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And then a stingray comes out of nowhere and starts to attack the baby dolphins.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And I was the nearest, and I thought, "I'm going to put myself between the baby dolphins and the stingray."
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   So I swam and put myself between the baby dolphins and the stingray.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   The stingray didn't like that.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   It stung me in the lip.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And if that story was true, that would be really cool.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   But...
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   That's not what happened.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Thank you. Thank you.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I actually just got sunburned.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And I got so badly sunburned on my lip that it swelled up.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And the way it looks right now actually is kind of a lot better.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It really swelled up.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And I got this blister, and it got infected.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And I had to go to the hospital last night.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I landed last night, went straight to the hospital.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Anyway, all that to say, here at The Vine, we say, "Come as you are."
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And so I did think about putting on a mask today, but I'm coming as I am.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   All the good, bad, and ugly of me in this moment.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Don't worry. If you're in the front row, it's not contagious.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Okay? You guys are all good.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   One thing that is... I would appreciate prayer.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It's actually very painful, as you can probably imagine.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And so it actually hurts to talk.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And I was praying yesterday, and I was like, "God, I'm sharing a word for the church at the start of the year."
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And it's actually painful to talk.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   But I want to do this because what we want to share today with you guys
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   is something that our eldership, our pastoral team, our staff have discerned, we've prayed into.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And I want to share something that is a correction to us as a church
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   as well as an invitation to us.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And you know when God speaks, and He brings a correcting word,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   it's important that a church community like ours, or like any church community, listens to what God says.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   But it's also important that we don't just hear it privately as a leadership.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   We want to make sure that that's publicly aware and publicly understood.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   But I also want to share it for this reason.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I believe what we're talking about today is actually fundamentally
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   what God wants to do and shape in your life in the year ahead.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   You might have come into the Vine today, 1st Sunday of 2024,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   praying, wondering what is it that God wants to do in your life?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   How is it that God wants to speak to you today?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And if the Vine is your community of faith, if this is where you regularly worship,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   then I want to put it to you that what we're going to talk about today and over the next five weeks,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   and actually what we're going to talk about today, we're going to be talking about the whole year, all of 2024,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   is actually not just a word for us as a corporate church,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   it's also a word for you personally, individually.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And I feel like God's got a few things He wants to say.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   So I wonder whether we could pray as we come into this time together.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Father, what a joy it is to gather on a day like today,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   and to be a community together, and to come under the ministry of your word,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   not my words, not any pastor or leader's words, but under your word.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Lord, I want to pray that your word would speak today.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Father, I thank you that every single person in this room you love,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   you find is the joy of your heart.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And Lord, you have something you want to say.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And Lord, I pray that whatever words that I'm going to say,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   and not of you would fall away from their ears, your words would stick and remain true.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   And Lord, we open our hearts to your voice.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And I just want to pray, maybe you could just take a moment, just five seconds, to pray in your own heart.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Lord, I'm open to what you want to say to me this year.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Maybe just make that a prayer right now, just in the quietness of your heart.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Lord, I'm open to what it is that you want to say to me this year.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And Father, we are excited by that. And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Everyone says.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Back in September, end of September, I received a dream from God.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And it was whilst I was on holiday in Koh Samui in Thailand.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And if you've been at the Vine for any period of time,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   you'll probably know that often God speaks to me in dreams.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   That's often how I hear from the Lord.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Weirdly though, I often receive these dreams when I'm actually on holiday.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   I think this is kind of bizarre because as a pastor, as a full-time pastor,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I carve time out regularly during my work schedule to hear and discern and to get dreams and vision from God.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   But the time that he often chooses to download stuff to me is whilst I'm on holiday.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   So I actually have said to my elders, "You should just keep me on holiday the whole time for the benefit of the church."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But they didn't buy that.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   But anyway, oftentimes God speaks to me when I'm on holiday.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And here it was, the same thing, actually the last night of this holiday that Chris and I were having for our 25th anniversary.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And God gave me a dream.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And I know when the dreams are from God, they're incredibly vivid.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   They're incredibly detailed.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And usually they have something to say to us as a church community.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And so let me tell you about this dream.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   In the dream, I was in a massive large room, a room not too dissimilar to this one.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Actually, it was probably a bit bigger than this one, but it was a big large room.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And the room was completely empty.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   There was nothing in this room except for two armchairs in the middle of the room.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And in the dream, I found myself sitting in one of the armchairs, and opposite me was another armchair.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And that armchair was... nobody was there. It was empty.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And as I'm sitting there staring at this empty armchair in this massive empty room, God's presence fell in the room.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And it was the most incredible thing.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   The glory of God was all around the room.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   His presence was in the atmosphere.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And actually, it reminded me straight away of those times when we gathered to worship here at the Vine.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   And we've just experienced an incredible time of worship here together this morning.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And it's those moments that my mind went to as I'm sitting in this chair,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   and I'm experiencing this incredible sense of God being in the atmosphere, being in the room.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   You know what it's like when you come to worship here, and it feels like there's this kind of tangible reality of God in the air, if you will.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And that's what it felt like.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   But as I was sitting there in this dream, a thought went straight through my mind.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   And the thought was this.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I'm not satisfied with God just being in the atmosphere around me in the room.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I want God to come and sit down opposite me.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   My heart was, as much as I was enjoying the reality of His presence around us,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I wanted Jesus to come and sit with me and be tangibly present with me
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   so that we could be face to face together,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   so that we could commune in a way that is far deeper and far more intimate
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   than just the reality of His presence in the room.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   You following this?
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And so as I thought this, as I was like, "God, I don't want you just around me.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I want you with me. I want you here. I want you physically here."
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I saw all these shards of light and all this kind of light that sort of flashed around the chair itself.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And then I saw the cushion of the chair depress, as if somebody with some weight had just sat down,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   although I didn't see anybody, but I knew that Jesus had just sat down in front of me.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And this dream was incredibly real.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And I knew that Jesus had sat down in front of me, but I couldn't see Him.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   I didn't see His face or anything, but I knew He was there, not just in the room,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   but now fully present with me.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And I have to tell you, it was the most at peace in this dream.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   By the way, when I dream and God speaks to me in dreams, I can kind of think about it
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   in the moment that it's happening, and I kind of reflect as it's going.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And it was like, this is the most tangible sense of the presence and the power and the peace
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   and the shalom of God that I've ever felt.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And it almost was like in Jesus sitting right opposite me, even in my sin, in my brokenness,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   in the stuff that's ugly about me, the things that I don't talk about, all the stuff that I try to avoid,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   all of that was present to Him and none of it mattered at all.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I had complete wholeness in Him.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   It's basically what the Bible speaks about as shalom, completeness.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I was completely how I was designed to be as I was sitting opposite Jesus.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   It was the most beautiful kind of experience that I've ever had.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Now, right as I had kind of got my head around the reality of this beautiful experience,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   suddenly it changed.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And rather than Jesus being sat next to me or opposite me, suddenly a young adult from here at the Vine
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   that I know, she was sitting suddenly opposite me, which was a bit of a jarring experience
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   because it was Jesus and then it became this young lady.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And this young lady I know here at the Vine, and she's single.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And as she's sitting there, and before I can communicate with her or anything,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   she stands up and she turns sideways and she's pregnant.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And I thought, "This is bizarre."
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Because she's single, I know her, she's single, and she stands up and she turns to the side
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   to show me that she's pregnant.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Now, in all of this, I know that God's speaking to me about worship and our community as a church.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I know that all of this dream, because of the way it started and the presence of God in the room
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   and it reminded me of the Vine, I know that all of this is speaking about our worship.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   So this lady was representing, in a way, worship at the church, and she's pregnant.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And I think immediately this is good news.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   What God's saying is, "In 2024, we should be pregnant with expectation in our worship at the Vine."
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   That God is going to birth some incredible things in our church this year.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   But immediately, God was like, "Nah."
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Because I knew she was single, but she was pregnant.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And something didn't feel right.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   The picture of it, the reality of it, I wasn't expecting it.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   It didn't feel right. It wasn't quite the way things should be.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And I felt immediately that God was saying, "Andrew, in the worship at the Vine..."
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Now, when I talk about worship at the Vine, I'm not talking about band or songs or music or that.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   I'm talking about your adoration, our adoration of Jesus.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   That's worship, our thanksgiving and adoration and praise, our lifestyle, the way we are.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Our worship at the Vine, God was saying, "Andrew, it's not quite right.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   There's something wrong.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Sometimes it looks right. Sometimes it doesn't look right.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   There's some problem with the worship."
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And as I was sitting in the reality of this lady who was pregnant, it didn't feel right.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   I knew that there was something wrong here.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   I felt like God said this, "Here's the sense, Andrew.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   The church has settled for the general atmosphere of God,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   and they are not pushing beyond that to the actual person of God."
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And I want to say this as strongly to us as I can.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   That I think one of the corrections God is bringing to us at the Vine is that at times here at the Vine,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   we have settled simply for the general atmosphere of God.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Oh, we come in on a Sunday and we sing our songs and we enjoy a nice feeling together,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   and we think that that's enough.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   And we've settled for the general atmosphere of God,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   and we haven't pushed beyond that to meet with the actual person of God.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   As I was sitting in that reality, suddenly my dream changed and gone were the two chairs.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And here's what happened next.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   There was a great big bed.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   There was a massive bed, a bed as big as you could ever imagine in this room,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   filled with this whole room.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   It was one big bed, one massive mattress.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And on this bed, I could see all these people sitting.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   There were some people sitting on their own.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   There were some people sitting as couples.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   There were some people sitting in groups, like as friends in groups.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And all of them were covered in bed sheets on this massive bed.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Now, it's important that you understand there wasn't anything overtly sexual in this,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   but I knew that God was speaking to me about intimacy.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And He was saying, "Here's the reality.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I have created people to be intimate with me,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   but at the vine, you have replaced your desire to be intimate with me
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   with only a desire to be intimate with one another."
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Come on, church.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   I know this is strong, but I'm putting it out there.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   That we have replaced our rightful desire to be intimate with God,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   and we are only interested in being intimate with one another.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Whether that's groups of friends in the intimacy of friendship,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   whether that was couples in the intimacy of sexual intimacy,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   whether it was people who were on their own trying to find intimacy in various other ways,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I think the bed represented a lot of different things,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   but it was the reality that there are alternative forms of intimacy
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   that you can experience.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   As soon as I saw that, the bed disappeared again, and, woom,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I was straight back to the two chairs, and once again, I was sitting in the armchair.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   And right opposite me, the armchair decompressed once again
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   as the presence of Jesus sat down.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   And as soon as the presence of Jesus sat down in front of me again,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   I felt this incredible, powerful sense of peace and calm.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Immediately, I knew that every longing I had in my heart,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   every thing that I desired, all the intimacy that I could ever want for
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   was satisfied in the reality of the presence of God.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Not the atmosphere of God, but the person of God who was right here with me.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And this time, I jumped up in my dream.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   And I jumped up, and I'm like, "Jesus, please stay there. Don't go anywhere."
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   But I was like, "I want others to experience this, right?"
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Like, I don't want to be selfish here.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   I don't want to be the only one who ever gets to feel complete and whole.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And so in the dream, I started to look around the room,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   and I tried to find some other people. Remember, it was a big, empty room.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   But I wanted to try and find some other people to come and sit down with me
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   and experience the intimacy that I was experiencing with Jesus.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And that was my longed for and my wish for,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   and that was basically everything that I could feel in every ounce of me was,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   "Where are the people who will come and experience,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   who will be willing to sit for a moment and experience this intimacy with Jesus?"
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And on that thought, unfortunately, I woke up.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And there I was, in my bed in Koh Samui, Thailand, on holiday,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   and I felt like I was in the worst place in the world
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   because I had just experienced the best place in the world,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   that there is nothing that can ever replace the intimacy of Jesus Christ.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And when you've experienced it like that,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   everything else is sort of this other kind of experience.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And although I was in paradise and in this beautiful place,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I longed to get back to that.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   I grabbed my phone from the side of my bed,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   and I started to make all these notes about the dream
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   so that I could tell you on the 7th of January.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   But I wrote all the details about the dream down as much as I could,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   and I started to reflect a little bit about intimacy
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   because I realized that what God's really speaking to us about is intimacy in this year.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   In fact, everything we're going to talk about here at The Vine is going to be that one thing.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   We're going to talk a lot about intimacy.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Here's the first thing you need to know about intimacy.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Every human being has been created with a desire, a longing for intimacy.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I believe that this is a God-created desire in all of us.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   God has created every human being with a desire to find intimacy,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   and that intimacy is both with Him and also with one another.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   That it is a good and a holy thing to want to be intimate.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   That we long and desire for intimacy.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And that desire that we have is so deep in us, so visceral in us,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   that it only ever fulfills its fullness in our relationship with God.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   I realized as I was literally sitting there writing all this down on my phone
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   at like 3 in the morning or whatever it was,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I remembered this is the reason why God created in the first place.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   I mean think about it for a moment. Think about it theologically.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   We're going to get theological. We've gone from dreams to theology.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Okay, with me. Think about it theologically.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Because in the Godhead at the beginning of all things,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   there is an eternal intimacy that they have that is the fullness and the completeness of Shalom.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   God did not need anything other than the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit together.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   In other words, creation is not to satisfy something that God lacks.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Are you with me?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   God has the fullness of intimacy.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   If you want to know and understand what intimacy is,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in the fullness together is the picture of intimacy.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   The reason why God creates is invitation.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   He creates because He wants to invite others into that intimacy.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   In the same way that I jumped out of my chair and I was like, "Jesus, stay there."
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   But who else can experience this with me?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   I could almost imagine the Trinity getting together.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   "Hey, guys, this is amazing, but let's create
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   so that others can come and be a part of this, and they can experience this,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   and they can know what the fullness is of this incredible intimacy.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And that intimacy will create the fullness in them, and it will be like this incredible thing."
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   The first thing you need to know about intimacy is that it's founded on three things,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   creation, love, and invitation.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Every form of intimacy makes space for others.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Intimacy creates a place for others to come.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Intimacy invites and loves and creates.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   And here is the really scary thing.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Every human being has this innate desire for that kind of intimacy,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   but in our fallen nature, in our brokenness,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   and in the struggles that we all hold in us,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   we more often than not seek the satisfaction of that desire for intimacy
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   in things that can never satisfy it.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   One of the great stories of Scripture is human beings trying to find intimacy
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   in other things other than in God, because they have this desire in them,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   and that desire drives them to try to satisfy it.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   But in order to try to satisfy that desire,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   they begin to look to one another for satisfaction that only God can bring.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Not that again, connecting with one another and being intimate with one another is a bad thing.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   It's not. It's a good and holy thing, but we have to get the order right.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   "Love the Lord your God with all your mind, heart, soul, and strength.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Know what it is to be intimately connected with God,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   so that out of the overflow of the intimacy, the fulfillment, the connection,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   we can jump up and invite others to it.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Our intimacy with one another is a response to the intimacy with God.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   But so often in our brokenness, we make our intimacy with one another the true intimacy.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   We think that's where we will get connected,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   when that so often just leads to further brokenness.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Let me put it in terms of the dream for you.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   There is an invitation to a deep and personal armchair experience with God.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   But so often we choose the more shallow, the more immediate bed experience in intimacy with one another.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   That's just the reality of us as human beings.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And it's also, I think, the reality for us here at the Vine.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And as God began to unpack some of this to us, I began to see and sense His correction.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I came back from the holiday to the staff here,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   and I began to talk to our staff and our elders and our pastors about this idea of intimacy.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And as God so often does, God doesn't ever just speak to one person.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   He never just speaks to the senior pastor.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   He had been speaking to many people in our staff, many people in our intercession team,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   for over a year about the same sort of ideas, the same threads,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   that there's something not quite right in our worship,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   that there's something not quite right within our community,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   that we're not engaging in intimacy with God in the way that He designed it for me.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   And as we began to talk about it, and as we began to pray about it,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   as we began to discern what it is that God is saying,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   I think ultimately what He's saying is this,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   that so often we show up on a Sunday,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   and we experience this incredible sense of worship like we had this morning,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   and we stop there. We think that is enough.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Or we think that that's what it's all about.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   That's not what it's about.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Intimacy with God is not fully about coming to church on a Sunday.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   And if we ever make the reality of our intimacy with God
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   based on the atmosphere we feel at the vine on a Sunday,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   oh, we are so missing out on the completeness of who we've been designed to be.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   You have not been designed for the atmosphere of God.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   You've been designed for the person of God.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Come on, church. Anyone here? Yeah?
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   There's a passage in Scripture that I love.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   It's found in Psalm 100, verse 4, and it says this,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   "We enter His gates with thanksgiving in His hearts."
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   We go into the courts with praise.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   The psalmist is being beautiful here because the psalmist is creating an imagery of the temple.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   He's talking literally about the temple.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And if you know anything about the temple,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   it was designed with the Holy of Holies right in the center of the temple,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   where the fullness of God's presence was.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And in the Holy of Holies, only one priest could go in once a year,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   and only after a purification rite of a number of days.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   And it was always a thing.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   But outside of the Holy of Holies was where the sacrifices were made.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And that was where the priest stood for the atonement of sin.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   It was one of the most intimate expressions and connections
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   that humanity could ever have with God.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And outside of the inner courts were the outer courts.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   And on the outer courts is where they paid for the animals to be sacrificed,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   where they did business, where they connected communally.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And then outside of that were gates that led people into all of that.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   The idea in the temple was that you went through the gates into a deeper place of intimacy.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   And the psalmist says, "Do you want to know what it is that brings you as a human being
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   into a deeper place of intimacy?
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   It's worship.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   It's worship. It's adoration. It's thanksgiving. It's praise.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   You enter the gates with thanksgiving on your heart.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   You go into the courts with praise.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And your worship, your worship is the vehicle that moves you
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   from outside of God's presence into the heart of His presence.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   The problem is, he did not write, "You camp at the gates with thanksgiving in your heart."
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   He did not say, "You stand on the outside of the courts
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   and you just stay there with praise."
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   He says, "There's movement. You're going from the outside into the inner place."
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   The problem I think we have at the vine sometimes
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   is that we're camping at the gates with our worship.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   And every time we think that when we gather on a Sunday
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   and we experience this incredible sense of God's presence,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   as important and as good as that is, but when we think that that's enough,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   or when we think that that's all there is, oh, we are so missing out.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   We're camping at the gates.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   I want you to have a mind shift.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I want you to think every Sunday when you come in
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   and we experience the power of God together,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   which is a beautiful, precious thing.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   You should be thinking, "That's a gate.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   This is a gate right now. I'm entering through this into something else.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And that something else is a deeper, more intimate, more personal relationship with God
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   where God will tell me things that will shape and change me.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Not always things that I can handle. Not always things that I like.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   But God, I want that deepened relationship.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   I don't want you in the atmosphere. I want you right here."
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   We enter His gates with thanksgiving on our hearts.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And God is saying that this is a correction, but it's also an invitation.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   It's an invitation for us as a church to go,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   "This is what I want to make 2024 about.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   If there's anything I could start the new year with,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   surely it's this, that actually I get the great joy of being a human being
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   that experiences incredible intimacy with others,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   but that intimacy comes first and foremost through my intimacy with God."
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   See, here's the thing you need to realize.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Our vision here at The Vine is growing big people.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   It's all about your maturity in Jesus.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   We do everything at The Vine to help you to grow in your maturity with Jesus.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Hear this, you will always remain spiritually immature
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   if all you ever do is connect with the atmosphere of God.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   You will always stay spiritually immature
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   if all you ever do is connect with just the atmosphere of God,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   rather than pressing through that to the actual true and living person of Jesus.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   And as wonderful as His atmosphere is,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   as wonderful as that presence is on a Sunday,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   it's an invitation to you to intimacy.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Are you with me?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   It's not an invitation for you to feel good on a Sunday.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   It's an invitation to a life that is changed
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   by the intimacy of your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   So what we're going to do over this series here at the start of the year,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   over the next four weeks, we're going to unpack this idea
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   of how we can enter through the gates.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Over the next two weeks, I'm going to talk to you about
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   some of the ways that we struggle in our intimacy with God.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   I'm actually going to talk to you about two of the very key ways
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   that we actually stop ourselves from being intimate with Jesus.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   And then we're going to have two weeks
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   where we're going to look at alternative forms of intimacy,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   the things that we turn to other than in our direct intimacy with God.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And I believe through that, we'll be able to paint a picture for you
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   of what it is that we sense God is both correcting us in,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   but also inviting us lovingly to in the year ahead.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Is this helping anyone so far?
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Are you excited for your year?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Yeah. Okay.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Now, what I want to do is I bring things to a bit of a close.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   I want to tell you a little bit about what this vision for intimacy is like.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I want to give you a taste of what this intimacy can feel like, can be like.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   The Bible is filled with stories about this intimacy with God,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   this closeness with Him.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And rather than sort of say, "Hey, here are the five steps
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   that you can do in your life to be intimate with God."
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   The reality is intimacy is a very personal thing.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   I mean, if you talk about me and my wife, Chris, our intimacy together,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   we don't share in intimacy with anyone else.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   It's a personal thing. It's a unique thing.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   And I'm not just talking about sexual intimacy.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   I'm talking about communication and what we do as friends
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   and how we enjoy life, the shows that we like or whatever it is.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   There's a uniqueness to our intimacy.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   There's going to be a uniqueness to your intimacy with God.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   So we're not going to say, "This is exactly what you have to do
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   in order to be intimate," because that's for you to discover.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   What we will do, though, is paint for you a broad and beautiful picture
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   of what intimacy with Jesus looks like.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   And our prayer is, as you see that intimacy, you're going to go,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   "What can I do in my life to get like that?"
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Are you with me?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   All right. So let me paint for you this intimacy.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Now, before I read this, by the way, I'm about to read to you a psalm of David.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   You need to understand David was not a perfect person.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   David had many struggles.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   David was broken, and David had brokenness in intimacy.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   He had brokenness of sexual intimacy.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   He had brokenness with his friends.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   David is a complicated person.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And yet, even in the complications of his brokenness,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   he can express this desire and this need to be deeply intimate with God.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   And I think that's an encouragement for some of you here,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   because you might be hearing this, and you might be going,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   "Well, I'm not that kind of Christian.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   I'm not even sure if I am a Christian.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   I'm not even sure if God can accept me intimately.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   I don't even know if He wants me to be with Him."
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   And you might be thinking that your sin or your brokenness or your background
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   disqualifies you from intimacy with Jesus.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   If David is qualified, you are qualified.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Are you with me?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Now listen to this. Psalm 63 says this.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Listen to how David expresses his intimacy with God.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   "O God, You are my God.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Earnestly I seek You. My soul thirsts for You.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   My body longs for You.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   In a dry and weary land where there is no water,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   I have seen You in the sanctuary and beheld Your power and Your glory.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Because Your love is better than life, my lips will glorify You.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   I will praise You as long as I live, and in Your name I will lift up my hands.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   My soul will be satisfied as with the richest of foods.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   My singing lips, my mouth will praise You.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   On my bed I remember You.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   I think of You through the watches of the night, because You are my help.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   I sing in the shadow of Your wings.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   My soul clings to You. Your right hand upholds me.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Those who seek my life will be destroyed.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   They will go down to the depths of the earth.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   But the King will rejoice in God.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   All who swear by God's name will praise Him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Can you hear David's passion?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   He's like, "Let me tell you about what this intimate relationship that I have with God is like.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   I mean, it's my everything. Everything in me longs and yearns to be connected to Him."
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Notice just some of the things that he says.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   He actually paints for us a beautiful picture of biblical immanency.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   He says, first of all, "You are my God."
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   I love this. "You are my God," he says.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   In other words, there's no other God.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   There's no other thing that I can be intimate with that could ever satisfy me.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   You are the only thing that can satisfy me.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And notice, he says, "You are my God."
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   He doesn't say, "You are Israel's God."
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   He doesn't say, "You're a God of some nation."
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   He didn't say, "You're the God of the vine at 11 a.m. on a Sunday."
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   He says, "You're my God."
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   This is personal.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   I know you. I want you.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   We're together. We're connected and committed.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   You are my God.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Some of you, the best prayer you can do in 2024, right at the start,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   is simply to say that prayer after the service.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   "God, you are my God."
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Because some of you, maybe that will be a struggle.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   But for some of you, that's your soul cry.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   That's your first response to recognize that maybe you haven't been able to say that,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   but that's the desire of your heart.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   "You are my God."
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Notice the passion he brings.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Notice things like, "My soul thirsts for you.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   My body longs for you because your love is better than life.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   My soul will be satisfied. It's with the richest of foods.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   My soul clings to you."
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   He talks about this idea of his soul, the innermost part of who he is.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Not just his being or his thinking,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   but everything about him longs for this intimacy with God,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   and he's crying out for that intimacy.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   That's like me sitting there and going,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   "I'm not satisfied anymore with you in the atmosphere.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   I want you right here.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   My soul clings to you," says David.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Now notice he talks about two very important things.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   He says, "I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory."
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   There it is.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   "I have seen you at 11 o'clock at the vine in Wanjai,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   and I beheld your power and your glory."
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Amen?
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   I want you to hear this, everything I've been saying today.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   We're not changing anything in terms of what we do here on a Sunday.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   We love the reality of God's presence with us.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   We'll continue to worship and praise him and do all the things that we do.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   What we're calling for is a bit of a mindset change,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   because what we do on a Sunday is not necessarily wrong,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   but how we're reacting to it is what I think God is trying to create.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Because David says, "I've seen you in the sanctuary.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   I beheld your power in that place."
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   It's an amazing thing he's saying.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   "I love the sanctuary.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   I love the power that I feel and experience there."
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   But notice what he also says.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   He also says, "On my bed I remember you.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Through the watches of the night you are with me."
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   In other words, I have felt your glory in church, but guess what?
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Your glory is not just in the church.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I've been intimate with you on a Sunday at 11 o'clock, but guess what?
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   God, you're also intimate with me at work on a Monday morning at 9.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Guess what? You're there with me all the time.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Because my intimacy with you is not defined by a location.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   It's defined by a relationship.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   My intimacy with you is not defined by some band who plays well.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   My intimacy with you is defined by the Word of God, my relationship with you,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   my prayer life, how I open Scripture.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   It's defined by so many other things.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   I have seen you in the sanctuary, and I beheld your power,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   but I have not made that my all and all.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   I've also found you on my bed late at night when I'm anxious and overwhelmed.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   I've found you in the darkest watches of night.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   I have experienced your intimacy in all of my life.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   That's what it means to commune with God.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Then he says all these things.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Now, I'm not going to call these benefits.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I'm not going to call these benefits of intimacy, because if I call them that,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   some of you in this room will want to seek him for his intimacy for the benefits.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   And as soon as we seek God intimately for what God can do for us,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   we've missed the whole point, and I'm going to talk about that in a couple of weeks' time.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   These are not benefits. Let me talk about these as fruits of intimacy.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   These are things that are born in our lives as we find ourselves intimate with God.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Very quickly, here they are.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Things like, because you are my help, God helps us.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   God comes and be with us.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   He says, "I've hid in the shadow of your wings."
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   There's protection. That's one of the fruits of intimacy, the protection of God.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Your right hand upholds me, feeling God is with us in the darkest moments.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   When life is overwhelmed, it's a fruit of that intimate relationship with him.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Those who seek my life will be destroyed, knowing that God fights battles for you,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   that you cannot fight, that you'd be overwhelmed.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Those are the fruits. It's like confidence. It's like assurance.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   It's like knowing God is with you.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Let me pull this together with a quick definition of biblical intimacy.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   I would say it's this, an orientation of all of life that pushes beyond just the feeling of God
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   to an actual real and deep relationship with him that produces in us the fruit of assurance, confidence, and joy.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   That's Psalm 63. That's, I think, how so much of Scripture speaks about the intimacy of God.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   That's worth taking a photo of if you have a mobile phone.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Because we're going to be digging into that a lot over not just these weeks, but this year.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   As you're taking a photo of that, I wonder if the PowerPoint team, if you could jump back to that section earlier with the three questions.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   This is also something I want you to take a photo of, and I'm going to finish with this.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Will we continue to simply enjoy the atmosphere of God, or will we desire to move beyond this to deepen our relationship with the person of God?
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Will we continue to settle for lesser forms of intimacy to satisfy a longing that can only be fully satisfied by God?
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   And once we have found true intimacy with God, will we only long for ourselves to experience it, or will we…
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Is there another slide? It's okay if there's not.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Or will we invite others to experience it?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Here's how I'll close, and we're going to pray. I've gone a bit long. Is that okay? Everybody all right?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Here's how we're going to close.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   This is why we're doing it in 2024, why God's calling us to intimacy.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   2023 was about the Exodus. We spent a whole year pretty much on the Exodus.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   And the Exodus is all about that idea of God calling us out of slavery into freedom.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Why? We said it almost every week.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Why does God do the Exodus with Israel?
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   So he can draw them together in intimacy, so they can be their God, and they can be his people, they can become a worshipping community.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   That's what he said to Pharaoh, "Release my people, let them go, so they can worship me."
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   2023 was our Exodus. It makes sense, therefore, that 2024 God is calling you to intimacy.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   You've gone through Exodus. Now is the time to draw near to God.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   My prayer for you is that you will find your satisfaction fully in him.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   My prayer for you is that he will challenge you to let go of some false versions of intimacy that you're holding on to.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   My prayer for you is that you'll want to push beyond the great experience of Sunday morning here at the Vine,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   and actually find a deeper relationship with him in your everyday life.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And through all of that, he will be glorified. Amen?
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Could you stand with me? I would love to pray with you.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   And maybe if you're comfortable, you can open your hands.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   And I'm going to pray, and then the team are going to play.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And we're going to finish with a song of worship, which is designed to move us through the gates into God's presence.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   Lord, I thank you so much for each person here.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Lord, I thank you that as we start the fast tomorrow, we start the fast with a passion for intimacy.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   And Lord, we thank you that for the 21 days, we're going to get a devotion every day written by a congregation member
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   talking about their own intimate relationship with Jesus.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   And Lord, I pray that the fast, I want to just pray over you right now.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   And if you've not yet decided what it is for you to fast, that's fine.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   You've got about 15 hours to do so.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Lord, I want to pray that you would bless each person in this room with what it is that you're asking them to sacrifice,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   to let go of, to lay down, so that they can move from the atmosphere of God to the person of God,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   so that they can commune with you intimately.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Lord, fasting is putting something aside to commune with you deeper.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Lord, I pray as we move into the fast tomorrow, that each person in this room watching online and our overflow
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   will be filled Lord, with your intimate connection as they sacrifice and lay something down
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   to start 2024 responding to your word, Lord.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Father, there are some people in this room that are going to need to repent in the next number of weeks.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   Lord, I know I need to.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And so Lord, I want to pray for your kindness that leads us to repentance.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   And Lord, if there are people in this room that have been convicted by this word this morning,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   I pray that they would bring that to you and respond and ask for your forgiveness.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   And that they would start this year with an invitation to a deeper relationship with you.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Lord, as we talk about how we stop ourselves from being intimate, as we talk about alternative forms of intimacy,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   would you speak to us Lord, each one of us.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   And Father, ultimately, that we would grow to be the people that you have created us to be.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   We're excited about this journey, Lord.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   When you speak a word like this, it is always because you are doing it in love
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   to see your people become the very people you've created them to be.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   I pray you would release this joy, release this excitement and expectation,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   release your conviction and repentance over the Vine Church,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   so that 2024 could be truly a year where we find you in new and fresh ways.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Everyone says amen.
