[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Well, we've had a great series over the month of October into November called The Remedy
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.840]   for Relationships, as we've looked at different elements of our relationships and those broken
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.420]   relationships in our lives and how we can strengthen them.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.600]   And I'm really excited.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.840]   We got Pastor Ellison finishing off the series with us today.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.080]   Can we put our hands together for Ellison as he comes?
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.280]   I really want to honor this man.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.560]   I was going to be away for the month of October in Egypt filming for our Exodus series, and
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.760]   I asked Ellison to curate a series, come up with it, to put it together biblically, to
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.840]   talk to all the speakers, train them, get them ready, comment on their sermons, prepare
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.840]   them to preach.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.400]   And this man's done the whole series.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400]   It's been fantastic.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.960]   Can we honor him in that?
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.600]   And why don't we stretch out our hands?
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600]   Let's pray.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.640]   Father, I'm very grateful for Ellison, Brittany, Isaiah, for this family amongst us.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.700]   And Lord, as Ellison comes and brings a message that I know is deeply in his heart, Father,
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.460]   we open our hearts now to what You want to say to us about our families.
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.400]   We recognize the joy of family and the struggle at times of family.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.680]   And we pray that You would come by Your Spirit and just teach us today, both through the
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.760]   Scriptures but also through Ellison's example in his life of how we can be better equipped
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.400]   to serve the most important relationships that are around us.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.400]   And we thank You for this in Jesus' name.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.800]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.800]   Amen.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800]   Thank you, Andrew.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   Good morning, church.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.800]   It's always good to be here.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.440]   And Yuen Long crew, and online if you're watching, Yuen Long, we are having the first gathering
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.440]   in Yuen Long right now.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.000]   They're having a barbecue and live streaming the sermon, I believe.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.560]   So yeah, that's very exciting for our church as we launch, start launching our way into
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.320]   Yuen Long and all that God's doing there.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.480]   So yes, as Andrew's been saying, we spent the past few weeks exploring different faucets
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.000]   of relationships.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.920]   We've looked at how we can sacrificially give of ourselves, be a good neighbor to the ones
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.920]   around us.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.800]   We looked at humility and how that countercultural it is in a city like Hong Kong.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.120]   We've talked about reaching out for others in the gospel.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.960]   Do we hide Jesus under a bushel or do we let Him shine in our lives as He's supposed to?
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.360]   We're talking about, we've talked about as a community, how do we relate to each other
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.640]   in our relationship with the Lord?
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.480]   And then last week, Carla talked to us about being reconcilers.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.180]   You know, are we willing to be reconciled to those who are different or even at animosity
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.560]   with us?
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.920]   And it's been a good journey for me.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.640]   I hope it's been a good journey for you too.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.800]   It's been a great honor working with my colleagues and building the sermon series.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.320]   And so we do round up today by looking at family relationships.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.080]   I'm going to tell you something by saying this, something mysterious.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.800]   So I daydream a lot, always daydream about the most ridiculous things.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.400]   I dream about myself being like a UFC champion and, you know, all that kind of stuff, grappling
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.720]   John Jones and choking him out.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.240]   I dream about receiving phone calls for some reason.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.280]   I always think, you know, when I pick up the phone, someone's going to call me and be like,
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.960]   "Ellison, yes, we need you at the airport within the next 25 minutes.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   Should you wish to confirm?"
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.880]   You know, and then I'll be there at the airport and they send me on some special mission.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.240]   You know, but it gets me thinking, the ring of a telephone is one of the most mysterious
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.120]   things in life, right?
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.520]   Because you can never really guarantee what you might hear on the other end.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.080]   We might have a good idea, for example, if my wife calls me around 4 to 5 p.m. in the
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.200]   evening, I can almost guarantee that the conversation is going to go like, "Hey, what do you want
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   to eat?"
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   "I don't know.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   What do you want to eat?"
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   "I don't know.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   What are you going to eat?"
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.240]   Until I correctly guess what she wanted to eat and we go and eat that, okay?
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.200]   Thirteen years, it's been the same conversation.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.160]   But you never really know.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.800]   You never really know until you actually pick up the phone and every now and then you get
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.200]   one of those phone calls that completely changes the trajectory of your life.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.120]   A few years ago, I got one of these phone calls.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.480]   So my wife, Brittany, and I, we just finished going through the process of becoming Project
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.360]   Bridge parents.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.040]   Now Project Bridge is a program by Mother's Choice that trains people to be foster care
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.920]   families, to train up people to be foster care families so you can receive children
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.560]   in your home, make sure they have a safe, healthy place until they're matched into their
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.720]   forever families.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.400]   And so we did the training because, you know, we had fostered a few children in the past,
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.080]   three other children in the past.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.200]   We'd received them in their home and provided some foster care for them.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.600]   But we'd never done any official training for that.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   So we thought, "You know what?
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.760]   We'll do the training.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.600]   It seemed like a good thing to do and in case the need comes up again in the future, we
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.480]   would be able to do that."
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.580]   But we never really expected the need to come up.
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.280]   And so when we got the call that there was a one-month-old baby that needed a foster
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.440]   home, to be honest, our reaction was a bit more like, "Oh, actually, I don't know."
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.240]   I mean, we didn't know how long this child would be with us.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.960]   We had very little information at the time.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.320]   And you know, things were going well for us.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.580]   We were living smoothly.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.180]   We had holidays planned.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.080]   The home was nice and calm and tidy.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.900]   We had no major responsibilities.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.760]   We were enjoying what you call dink life.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.680]   Do you know what dink means?
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.240]   Double income, no kids.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.440]   Perfect, right?
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.400]   We could just do whatever we want, whenever we wanted, not accountable to anybody.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.360]   And so receiving a child into the home just seemed like a giant disruption that we weren't
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.840]   ready to engage with.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.520]   But when we got this phone call, it just so happened that it was during the Justice Conference,
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.280]   the last Justice Conference we had in Hong Kong.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.460]   And it just so happened that one of the keynote speakers at that Justice Conference was a
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.020]   man called Dr. Krish Kandai.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.020]   And Krish Kandai, he lives in the UK, amongst many other things, has a huge heart for foster
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.020]   care and adoption.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.660]   He himself welcomes many children into his home, has adopted many kids, and that was
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.060]   exactly what he was talking about, the importance of foster care and adoption.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.740]   Now during that session, you know, I was running around doing different things.
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.100]   Brittany and I weren't sitting together, but our reaction was exactly the same.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.140]   Tears down our eyes, we kind of found each other in the hallways, "Okay, let's do it,
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.140]   let's do it, honey.
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.660]   Yes, Jesus, we'll take this child, whatever it takes, we're going to do it."
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.740]   And soon after that, we received baby Sam into our home.
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.420]   This is baby Sam right here.
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.820]   He was one month old from when we joined our home.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.300]   We picked him up from the hospital.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.820]   And so what followed was the most amazing nine months of looking after Sam, watching
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.580]   him grow up, teaching him new things, celebrating his milestones, Christmas, Chinese New Year,
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.240]   visit to Disneyland.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.100]   We did all the things you would expect a family to do.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.220]   And I had no idea I could love a child I had just met so deeply.
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.620]   I mean, from the moment I met baby Sam, I was done.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.380]   I held him in my arms, picked him up from the hospital.
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.040]   It was like my heart was completely there with him.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.700]   But also during that time, we had to wrestle with a lot of questions.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.820]   People asked us questions like, you know, or gave us advice, very bad advice, like,
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.460]   "Oh, you know, don't get too attached to him because it's going to be very sad when you
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.460]   have to let him go."
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.140]   "Oh, it's going to be so difficult.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.020]   Do you guys think you can cope?"
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.540]   Or, "How are you going to give him up in the future?"
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.360]   You know, by the way, we never gave him up.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.660]   Never use those terms when you talk to foster care and adoption children, okay?
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.260]   We're not giving children up.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.220]   They're being placed, adopted into a new home.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.800]   People would say things like, "Oh, I could never do that.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.300]   It would be too much."
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.260]   But from our perspective, really, in the end, it wasn't even a choice.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.860]   If this child was going to be in our home, if we had said yes, we were going to love
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.640]   this child with our whole hearts.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.300]   We were going to form good, healthy attachments to him and let him form good, healthy attachments
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.580]   to us because this was the way this baby was going to learn what love is.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.260]   And I can honestly say Brittany and I, without any holding anything back, love that child
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.340]   with our whole hearts, even though we knew his time with us would be temporary.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.020]   And not a lot of people in this room right here were part of that journey, walking alongside
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.700]   with us, supporting us in our journey with baby Sam.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.500]   Did we think we could do it?
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.580]   No.
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.540]   Was it too much at times?
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.540]   Yes.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:19.380]   But was it worth every ounce of our effort, love, and tears?
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.380]   Absolutely.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.380]   100%.
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.660]   Okay, so why am I telling you this story?
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.220]   Well, a couple of things.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.900]   Firstly, November is Adoption Awareness Month.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.220]   All over the world this month, people and organizations are promoting the importance
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.460]   of foster care and adoption.
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:43.220]   And in Hong Kong, right at this moment, there's a huge need for this.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.620]   A news article came out not too long ago, you might have seen it, that said, "Over the
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.300]   next few years, because of all the disruptions and all the families leaving that we've had
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.340]   during protests and COVID and all the things we've been facing in this city, there's going
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.100]   to be a 20% reduction," they believe, "in the amount of foster homes that are available
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:08.020]   for children, leaving kids in need in a very vulnerable position."
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.020]   But this is it, church.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:14.900]   This is where we have an opportunity to step up and literally make a dramatic, life-changing
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.460]   difference in the lives of these children.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:23.620]   So the first thing I want to urge us today is this, ask ourselves this question, "Has
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.260]   the Lord called you to adopt children?
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.600]   Has the Lord called you to be foster parents, giving kids a safe home to live in before
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.400]   they are adopted into their forever families?
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.220]   Or what else can I do to support this area of life?"
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.740]   If even if you just have a little bit of an inkling, if you're just a little bit curious,
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.180]   don't ignore that.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.380]   Be curious, as Carla said last week.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.340]   After all, this is literally a mandate from God.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.220]   God commands us to do this.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:59.140]   One James 2:7, "Religion that our God, our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this,
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:04.100]   to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself being polluted
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.660]   by the world."
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.700]   So find out more.
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.180]   Ask people that have gone through that journey.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.380]   There are many families in our community that have gone through that, including Pastor Andrew
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.460]   and Chris, and they would be more than happy to sit down with you to tell you about their
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.560]   adoption journey and what God has placed on their hearts in this.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.460]   Because I'm not kidding when I say if the church got the act together, if followers
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:32.220]   of Jesus really came together to do this, we could literally see every single child
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.860]   in this city adopted or fostered in safe, healthy families.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.860]   That's a reality.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.460]   That's a goal that can actually be met by the people of God.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:50.420]   So think about this church and ask God, "What have I been called to do in this area?"
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:55.540]   But as I was reflecting on this fact too, there's a deeper sort of theological truth
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.140]   that comes into mind and that convicts me as I look at this.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.960]   And to explore a bit more about that, we're going to turn to Galatians chapter 4.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.460]   So if you can follow on the screen or if you have a Bible with you, you can open up to
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.180]   Galatians chapter 4, verses 4 to 7.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.460]   Let me read this for you.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:18.740]   It says this, "But when the set time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman,
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.300]   born under the law, to redeem those under the law that we might receive adoption to
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.000]   sonship or daughtership.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.100]   Because you are His sons and daughters, God sent the spirit of His Son into our hearts,
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.360]   the spirit who calls out, 'Abba, Father.'
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.300]   So you are no longer a slave but God's child.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:42.880]   And since you are God's child, He has made you also an heir."
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.760]   You see, we just talked about these vulnerable children who are in need of homes, in need
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.180]   of someone to come and welcome them into a loving, safe family.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:57.340]   But sometimes also we forget, actually we don't forget, maybe we talk about this, we
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:02.100]   don't really absorb this, that if it wasn't for Jesus and what He had done for us on the
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:11.260]   cross, we too would be in the same position, vulnerable, hopeless, in need of a family.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.220]   And this is precisely why Jesus was sent by God onto this earth.
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:21.740]   God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law so
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.060]   that we might receive what?
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.540]   Adoption to sonship or daughtership.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.260]   God sending His Son was not an accident.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:36.740]   It was done with a plan and a purpose, for His intention for God to become our heavenly
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.140]   Father, for that relationship to be reconciled.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.700]   God sending His Son means that our sin no longer separates us or estranges us from Him,
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.540]   but rather we are adopted into His family.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:55.860]   God sending His Son was a way of His demonstrating His unconditional, very real love for us.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:01.820]   Before we did anything, God sent His Son to save us, to adopt us into His family, and
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.300]   He continues to love us no matter what.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:11.340]   So yes, you and I are just as much as in need of these children I was talking about earlier,
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:17.020]   to be adopted into a family, but into the family of God.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.220]   And so when this happens, there's a powerful and fundamental change in your identity and
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.220]   the trajectory of your future.
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.820]   When we become sons and daughters of God, because of this, we are granted this special
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.340]   level of closeness and intimacy in our relationship with Him.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.460]   We got a glimpse of that just now as we were worshiping together.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:40.580]   Because we are sons and daughters, He sent His Spirit to us, the Spirit who calls out
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.960]   Abba, Father.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.900]   We are no longer slaves, but we are children of God, and since we are His child, we are
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.820]   also heirs.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:55.880]   So I admit it, growing up in a more conservative, traditional background, I would get really
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.900]   weirded out when people would call God an Abba God or Daddy God.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.340]   It's always sounded strange to me.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.400]   I'm still getting used to it.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.340]   But it did make me think about this.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:12.700]   You see, one of the awkward things in our journey with fostering Sam was the fact that
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.140]   we had to come up with something that he could call us.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.260]   Because baby Sam had his biological parents.
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.900]   He also had a family that he was preparing to be adopted into, and we were sort of in
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.980]   this interim period.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.780]   So what do we call ourselves?
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.840]   We weren't mom and dad.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.380]   So in the end, we came up with Daddy Elle and Mama Britt, and like I said, we would
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.700]   call him Baby Sam.
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.940]   We thought that was close enough without crossing any lines or becoming anything inappropriate
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.840]   or anything like that.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.020]   But it was tough, I tell you.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.020]   It was really tough.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:48.020]   I mean, it might sound silly, but every time I held Sam, every time I hung out with him,
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.620]   every time I would go home to him, I would so badly want to say, "Hi, son.
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.140]   Daddy's back."
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.140]   But I couldn't say those words to him.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.240]   But here's the thing.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:04.860]   When it comes to our relationship with God, there are no such barriers of intimacy because
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.540]   we have been fully adopted into God's family.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.460]   You are so much adopted that He's willing to give you His inheritance.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.600]   You are an heir to His kingdom.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:22.220]   So we sit right here today as sons and daughters of God, fully loved, fully accepted, filled
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.820]   with the Holy Spirit, which is the promise of God's presence with us, His intimacy with
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.820]   us.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:33.340]   These things give us full permission without hindrance to approach God and call Him Abba,
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.620]   to call Him Daddy.
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.860]   This is the equivalent of Daddy.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.020]   Abba is equivalent of Daddy.
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.740]   And in Jesus' day, you would use this with a father no matter what your age.
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.960]   It wasn't necessarily a small child talking to its father.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.000]   It wasn't a status of your age, but rather the status of your relationship and your intimacy
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.200]   with your father that you would call him Abba.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.480]   So this is our identity.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.600]   And yes, we talk about it, we sing about it, it makes us feel good and safe to embrace,
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.080]   and so it should.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.740]   As a follower of Jesus, this is your number one identity.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.820]   What you stand on, what you build your life upon, what you build your faith upon should
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:17.400]   be the fact that you have an unbreakable relationship with Jesus.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.160]   But here's the other thing.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:26.160]   On the other hand, if we really want to embrace this, then I believe there are certain conditions.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.800]   I mean God's love for you is unconditional.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:33.880]   Yes, I believe that strongly, but the conditions, I mean that it should change the way we function
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:39.600]   as human beings, as children of God.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:45.620]   It should change the way we approach all our relationships, including the relationships
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.080]   we have with our earthly family.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.880]   God has a huge heart for families because God longs to see the generations praising
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.400]   His name.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.880]   God sees the importance of families, and this is why fostering adoption is so important
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.600]   because He knows children grow, thrive, and live the best when they're in good, healthy,
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.080]   loving families.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.800]   And we're sons and daughters of God.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.560]   We are brothers and sisters with each other, yes, but we're also sons and daughters here
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.760]   of our parents.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.920]   We refer to each other as brothers and sisters in Christ, but we also have our own brothers
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.920]   and sisters.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.600]   And we call the church the bride of Christ, but we, some of us here, are here with our
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.560]   spouses or we have our own spouses that we relate to as well.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.000]   So church, let me ask this question, how are those relationships going in your life right
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.180]   now?
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.480]   I ask this because I know from my own personal experience, the ironic thing is that it's
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:50.900]   possible that we might feel our relationship with God is thriving and doing well, we have
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:56.320]   a great relationship with our church family, but meanwhile, our relationships in our own
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.780]   homes and families are broken and tense.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.200]   And since I'm standing here with you right now, let me give you an example of that.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.700]   You guys see me week after week, I host services quite often, I get to preach sometimes.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.720]   I've met with a lot of you here for lunch, dinner, coffee, we've prayed together, we've
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.720]   served God together.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   And I think I've done an okay job at this.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.200]   I mean, I'm still working here right now, haven't been let go yet.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.400]   Most of you here, I think, have a pretty good impression of me.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.920]   But you know, sometimes I wonder, actually, it's not even really wondering, I know, that
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.600]   if you ask my wife, if you ask my sister or my brother, if you ask my mom or my dad, the
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.220]   answer might be quite different.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.060]   The patience that I give so freely to you guys, it's not always the same patience that
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.160]   I share with my wife or my son.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.280]   The generosity of the spiritual insights or advice that I give to you guys, my brother
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:58.260]   and sister might scoff at because they don't really see that side of me that often.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.800]   And I get it, right?
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.840]   Family relationships are hard.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.760]   And working on these relationships is probably one of the most challenging things that we
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.280]   can do.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.880]   And for some of us, relationships within our families are wounded and scarred by serious
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.800]   abuse because the ones we thought would love us and protect us have turned out to be the
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.280]   ones to hurt us the most.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:26.380]   And hear this very carefully, church, if this is the case, like Carla said last week, safety
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.260]   is the priority.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.480]   This is not a call to return into an abusive situation.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.580]   I cannot stress that more clearly.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:40.480]   But good, healthy families are essential to God's plan of redemption.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.320]   Spouses that love and respect each other.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.200]   Children who honor their parents.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.400]   Parents that empower their children.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.080]   Siblings that have each other's backs.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.400]   We need to build healthy families because healthy families are one of the ways God is
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.740]   going to demonstrate His love for the world.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:03.520]   Healthy families literally have the power to transform entire societies.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.280]   During the protests and the pandemic, we've heard from so many people, one of the areas
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.200]   that struggled with immediately that felt the strain of these things happening was the
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.760]   area of family relationships.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.840]   It was as if, you know, things were already tense, put into a pressure cooker, and what
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.860]   came out was just a huge mess.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:28.720]   So we have a chance to redeem this because God cares about families.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.040]   Scripture is full of instructions about how God wants the family to work.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:39.120]   And I understand also, yes, each family unit might look quite different.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.680]   And your family structure might not be the same as, you know, what the traditional, whatever
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.480]   that is, family structure is.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.320]   So I apologize we don't have time to get into every single nuance of families right now,
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.400]   but I really do hope that you get the heart of what I'm trying to say today.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.240]   So we're going to turn back to Scripture.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.940]   We go now to Colossians chapter 3, starting in verse 18 to verse 20.
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.400]   Let's look at this.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.840]   It says this, "Wives, submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.040]   Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:24.360]   Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged."
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:32.440]   So verse 18, "Wives, submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord."
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.200]   Okay, I know how this sounds.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.720]   A married pastor up here spouting about submissive wives, okay, hear me out.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:46.520]   I know, okay, the word submit can start feelings and images of harsh dominance and resistance.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:51.280]   And throughout history, we must acknowledge that there has been a lack of protection for
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.080]   women's rights and women's empowerment.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.780]   And it's a battle that we still have today.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.780]   But hear me also in this.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:05.280]   This verse isn't talking about husbands giving some sort of authority to dominate over the
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.280]   wives.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.500]   It's not saying that.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.640]   This isn't a call for wives to attend to a husband's every whim and wish.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.680]   This isn't a scripture about women don't have a place or don't have their own opinions.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.080]   This isn't a scripture to say that women are wives are second class in comparison with
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.160]   the roles of their husband, okay?
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.600]   It's not saying that.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.640]   The model for this submission here isn't determined by the husband's dominance.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:37.840]   Rather, the submission of Jesus to the Father and submission of the church to Jesus is the
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.600]   model of what real submission looks like.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.160]   So submission is not really about dominance.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:49.840]   Submission is about creating a beautiful partnership of mutual accountability between husband and
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.500]   wife, not the superiority over one and the other.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.400]   So what does this look like?
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.720]   A few keys here.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.480]   Firstly, it's this.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.280]   Submission comes voluntarily.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.320]   This is a challenge for you wives.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.400]   But you have to choose to engage in this.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.680]   Okay, please again, don't misunderstand me.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.200]   It doesn't mean giving up your rights, giving up your worth, giving up your dignity.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:23.520]   Choosing to engage, choosing to submit means actually taking a position of humility.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.920]   Learning how to be patient with your husband.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:33.680]   Sharing with him, supporting each other along the way, learning to forgive and listen well.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.080]   This is the posture of humility.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.840]   A good picture of this is what we see at the beginning when God created Adam and Eve, right?
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.760]   God created Adam and gave him Eve as a what?
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:50.320]   As a helper to work alongside him to support each other in that journey, not as someone
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.440]   that Adam could demonstrate his authority over.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.440]   Second thing is this.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:02.640]   Submission, it says, goes only as far as is fitting with the Lord.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.920]   Because ultimate authority always belongs to Jesus.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:12.480]   And wives are called to submit only as far as is appropriate for a follower of Jesus
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.120]   to do so.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.440]   Which is why the second thing Paul goes on to say is this.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.640]   Husbands, love your wives.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.640]   So this proves my point.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.640]   It's interesting, right?
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.640]   If Paul was talking about male dominance, if Paul was really concerned about the man
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.960]   being in charge of everything the wife does and all that stuff, he probably would have
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.520]   said, "Husbands, dominate your wives.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.360]   Tell them what to do."
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.000]   But he doesn't.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   The core here is to love.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.800]   And you have to understand, actually this was super counter-cultural in the context
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.000]   that Paul was ministering.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.080]   Because in those times, love wasn't even considered necessary as a part of a marriage relationship.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:58.920]   But God realizes that in order to build healthy families, the driving force must be love.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.800]   So this is why he says, "Love your wives.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.200]   Do not be harsh with them."
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.140]   To not be harsh with our wives means that we don't treat them like subjects.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.980]   To not be harsh with our wives means holding no bitterness against them.
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:16.740]   This is the root of the word harsh, it actually refers to bitterness.
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:21.200]   So what does bitterness look like in a husband's relationship to the wife?
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.440]   Well I think for me, at least in my understanding, it comes this.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.840]   Bitterness comes when husband starts to blame the wives for things.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:33.600]   Bitterness comes, we build bitterness in our wives when there's finger pointing.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.640]   Bitterness comes when we project our failures onto our wives.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.960]   Bitterness comes when we have unrealistic expectations of our relationship with our
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.140]   wives.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.480]   So the core here is to love.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.160]   But not just any kind of love.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.520]   Sacrificial love.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.040]   The same love that Jesus showed the church.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:26:01.160]   Husband, love your wives as Christ loves the church.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.400]   And how did Christ love the church?
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.480]   So much so that he was willing to die for the church.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.840]   Give up everything to redeem the church.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.600]   And just as the wives looks to Jesus as an example to submit, the husband looks to Jesus
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.140]   as a model to love.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.880]   And how did Jesus love?
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:25.080]   Ultimately, Jesus loved through great sacrifice.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.600]   So this is a strong challenge, husbands.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.440]   It's almost as a verse is saying, if a wife wants to see what the love of Jesus looks
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:38.760]   like, a good thing, a good example of that should be the husbands.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.760]   And this is a model.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:45.240]   This is a model, an ideal for a good, strong, healthy marriage.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.640]   And when we have a good marriage, within a marriage, sometimes children are involved
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.680]   also.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.200]   And so Paul gives some instructions to that as well.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.920]   Paul goes on to say, "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   Lord."
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   Okay.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.520]   I get it also.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.600]   When we use the word obey, again, it conjures up uncomfortable feelings.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.760]   I mean, obey?
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.760]   Really?
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.120]   Maybe for young children, of course, you don't really know how to think for themselves.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.320]   But you know, I'm a grown up.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.400]   I'm a grown person.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.160]   You know, do I still have to obey?
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.880]   In fact, when do we start becoming a child?
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.960]   When do we start becoming a child?
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.680]   When does that status change?
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   I mean, maybe we don't.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:35.360]   I mean, if we always want to embrace our role as a child of God, then we're always our parents'
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.040]   children too, aren't we?
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.080]   No matter how old we are.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.080]   I mean, as we grow and mature, our relationships, our parents might change, but your status
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.520]   as a child is not bound by age.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.960]   And so often I find this hard to remember for myself as well.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.760]   I find myself getting annoyed and frustrated at my parents.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.400]   You know, "Don't tell me what to do.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.080]   I'm a grown man.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.840]   I'm guilty of this all the time.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.520]   I'm getting better, but I still am.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.160]   A lot of the time when my mom calls, I just go, you pick up the phone.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.840]   I know what she's going to say too."
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   Uh-huh.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.840]   Okay.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.840]   Okay.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.840]   Okay.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   Okay.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   Okay.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   Okay.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.840]   Okay.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.840]   Okay.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.840]   Bye-bye, you know, and that's it.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   My aim is not to engage with her.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.680]   Okay, moms out there, okay?
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.320]   My aim is to get her off the phone as fast as I can so I can return to what I'm doing.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.320]   Right?
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:33.320]   It took my mom almost going to be with Jesus last year for me to start shifting my attitude
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.520]   towards that.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.920]   So what does it mean to obey as children from one to 99?
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.880]   What does it mean to obey our parents?
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:48.720]   There's three things here I want us to do in an effort to enjoy and to be a better children
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.880]   of our parents.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.440]   The three things are this, hearing, understanding, and responding.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.160]   So hearing.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.000]   Hearing is when we open our ears to what our parents have to say to us.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.840]   Hearing means you remain in a posture of receiving when your parents are trying to talk to you.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.680]   Responding means you refrain from talking over them, from allowing them suitable time
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.280]   and space to express themselves.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.340]   And this might not be easy, right?
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.520]   You might have to learn how to hold your tongue.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.600]   You might have to learn how to control your anger.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:28.480]   But we must be able to hear our parents because without hearing, we cannot move on to step
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.840]   two, which is understanding.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:39.040]   Understanding is a process of being able to fully put yourself in your parents' shoes.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:45.880]   Understanding is the ability to practice empathy, to look at situations from your parents' perspective,
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.960]   to put down your own defenses and agenda.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.520]   Let me give you an example from my own life again.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.000]   My dad and I, I think we have a good relationship.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.320]   We hang out, we go and eat.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.800]   We used to do a lot of trail running together.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:05.020]   He is an excellent dad, a man of honor, a man of integrity, a man of generosity.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.580]   But at the same time, growing up, I would admit I had a bit of a chip on my shoulder.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.920]   You know, because I would watch all these American movies where the dad would be like
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.440]   super affectionate, right?
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.640]   You get this, "Hey, sport, come over here," you know, and he like rubbed the child on
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.120]   the head and give him a hug, say, "Okay, now, go get them, son."
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.400]   And the son would be like full of confidence all of a sudden, right?
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.160]   And go out there and do a slam dunk and hit the home run and everybody would be cheering
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.920]   and like dad would come out again and hug them and it just looked like such a perfect
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.640]   picture of what a father was like.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.440]   And I would feel resentful because like my dad's never said those things to me.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.440]   My dad has never told...
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.040]   I've never heard the words, "I love you," come out of his mouth.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.960]   He's never given me a hug like that.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.440]   And I admit I would start to get resentful.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:50.960]   Well, how come my dad doesn't love me in that way?
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.200]   There was a particular point in time where I became really angry about this amongst other
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.500]   things.
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.720]   There was a time of my life where as a young adult, I'd just come back to Hong Kong.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.440]   I was working through a deep season of depression.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.760]   I felt like nobody cared about me.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.320]   I felt like my dad was just being silent, ignoring me because he wouldn't engage with
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:15.160]   me in conversation about my feelings until one night we were cooking dinner and my mom
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.160]   talked to me.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.960]   I'll never forget what she said.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.600]   She said, "You know what?
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.640]   You know, your dad has noticed that you've been acting different recently.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.820]   He's noticed that these days you're sad and he thinks you're going through a season of
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.020]   depression and he's been praying for you.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.020]   He hasn't eaten...
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.300]   He's fasted for the past three days.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.820]   He hasn't eaten a single thing for three days because he's been fasting and praying for
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:38.820]   you."
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.540]   I think I just wanted to know that, son.
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:45.740]   I had no idea that was what he was doing.
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:46.740]   And I got to think about it.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.660]   You see, what I failed to understand was my dad and his brothers never grew up with their
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.660]   dad.
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.460]   But his dad died when he was just a toddler.
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.400]   My grandma raised six children on her own, single-handedly.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.900]   He never had his dad around.
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:03.980]   He didn't have anyone to show him that kind of affection either.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:08.380]   And after coming to that understanding of where he was coming from, it helped me to
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:13.040]   show honor and respect and to obey him better.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.180]   So we must seek to understand.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.780]   The final thing is this, responding.
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:22.020]   Now responding is very different to reacting.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.420]   Reacting is almost like a reflex, right?
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.660]   Someone pinches you, you say, "Ow."
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.820]   Someone punches you, you turn the other cheek, right?
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.260]   Okay.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.060]   Reacting is just instinctual.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.340]   In this context, reacting is when your parents talk to you, you just come back with whatever
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.340]   you want to say that comes out of your mouth first.
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.340]   That's reacting.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.380]   And often reacting is not helpful.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.700]   But responding.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.780]   Responding is what happens when we've gone through the process of hearing and understanding.
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:55.900]   So that when we speak, our words, as Paul tells us later, can be full of grace, seasoned
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.200]   with salt.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:03.460]   Responding is opening up to your parents, being able to have civil, calm conversations,
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.040]   even on things that you might not agree with.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.700]   Responding is an act of love and honor to your parents.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:18.740]   Now, just as children are called to love and honor and obey their parents, parents are
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.340]   now called to do the same for their children.
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.340]   Let's read on.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:30.620]   "Fathers or mothers, parents, do not provoke your children, least they become discouraged."
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.100]   Okay, this is a word for you parents.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.100]   This is your turn.
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.020]   You guys were nodding your head, looking at your kids.
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.060]   We're talking about obedience, okay?
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.940]   Now here's a word for you.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.940]   Because there's mutual responsibility here.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.340]   And let me start by saying this.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:52.100]   We have to realize, parents, being a kid these days in Hong Kong is really, really tough.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:57.300]   It's no secret that almost from the day kids are born, we're born into a system that forces
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:02.220]   kids to achieve from the time they're barely even able to walk.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.820]   You have to get into the right nursery so you get to the right kindergarten so you get
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.500]   to the right primary school to get to the right high school, to get to the right university
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.900]   so you can get the best job that you can.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:15.460]   So when you're still like pooping in your nappy, you're already being forced to make
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:21.780]   life-changing, life-directing decisions from the time you're a baby.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:27.500]   It's a ridiculous system that a two-year-old has to go through an extensive interview to
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.180]   enter into a school, okay?
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.160]   Now again, don't hear me wrong.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.580]   I'm not anti-education.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.900]   I'm not saying that.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:41.340]   I'm not saying we shouldn't challenge our children to do hard things, to achieve, to
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:42.580]   study hard.
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.260]   All these things aren't bad in and of themselves.
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:50.980]   But what an awful lot of pressure it is for a child to force them into doing things to
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.980]   go through that kind of system.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:58.180]   Add this to the pressure, kids, from social media these days.
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.540]   When I was growing up, there wasn't much social media.
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.020]   I didn't grow up with smartphones and all that kind of stuff, so I can't even imagine
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:10.820]   the impossible challenge of relating yourself with all these things you see on social media.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:16.020]   The very real, but behind-the-scenes cyberbullying that a lot of kids are going through.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.620]   The extracurricular activities that we force them to go through.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.340]   And recently, the changes in school schedules, in school, out of school, all these kind of
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.420]   things.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:29.300]   Being a young person in Hong Kong is a difficult road.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:34.300]   So parents, let's take what scripture says here seriously.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.820]   Do not provoke our children.
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.260]   The word provoke is called eretizo.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.140]   It means to make them become resentful.
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:50.420]   So parents, in your effort to teach and educate your children, we have to be careful that
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:54.820]   we too are respecting them as individuals.
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:59.140]   One of the most amazing things about how God made us is that we are all unique.
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.620]   We are all worthy in their eyes.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:06.700]   God loves us, and his love of us doesn't change no matter what.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.620]   God's favor upon his children is not tied up to what they can achieve.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:16.300]   So why do we sometimes place these expectations on our kids?
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:21.560]   You know, Chinese parents, I know I'm stereotyping here, but one thing that bugs me so much every
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:27.300]   time I hear it, when I hear the words from a parent to a child, "Ah, you're useless."
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.620]   You are useless.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.100]   Parents say this all the time in this city, and it's a problem.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.220]   We need to stop tying up our children with what they can achieve.
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:42.380]   But did you know a recent study showed that only half of secondary school students in
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.940]   Hong Kong show signs of depression?
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:50.740]   Seventy percent of students in Hong Kong reported that they have a bad relationship with their
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.740]   parents.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.060]   This should break our hearts.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:59.380]   It should really make us think as parents, ask ourselves, "How do we contribute to this?
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.540]   And how do we demonstrate God's love to our children?"
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.660]   So here again are a few suggestions.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.080]   Get to know your child.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:13.420]   As the parent, yes, you are the parent, but how well do you truly know your child?
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.980]   How much time are we spending with them?
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:20.300]   Asking about their interests, asking them about their feelings, their hopes, their dreams.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:25.660]   These are great conversations to engage with your child regularly.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.660]   Acknowledge their efforts.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:33.900]   Again, achievement is not a bad thing in itself, but when everything is tied up to achievement,
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.800]   that becomes a lot of pressure.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.280]   When our kids do good things, yes, let's celebrate it.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.700]   Don't just take it for granted.
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:48.140]   But when they fail to achieve our expectations, celebrate their efforts.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.860]   Tell them, "Well done."
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.940]   Tell them, "Good job."
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.440]   Challenge and teach them to try again.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.420]   And let's never use shame to motivate our children to do better.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:07.500]   God never puts us to shame, so we should never do this to our children as well.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.340]   Finally it's this.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.700]   Remind them of their worth.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.280]   Children need to hear that they're good enough.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:18.980]   They need to be reassured that their worth is never and will never ever be tied up with
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.740]   what they can do.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:25.060]   They need to know that failing is okay, that it's not the end, but rather we learn from
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.000]   our failures and we move on.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.700]   And ultimately as parents, just as husbands and wives are called to demonstrate an example
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:36.700]   of the gracious love of God to each other, when your child looks to you, our goal for
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:42.980]   them is to give them a glimpse of what the Father's love for us might look like.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.880]   And here's the really beautiful thing.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.280]   When families are working as God intended them to work, when husbands and wives are
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.680]   loving each other, when children are obeying their parents, parents are empowering the
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.480]   children, God is pleased.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.680]   And the generations are blessed through such families.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.940]   Deuteronomy 7, 9, "The Lord your God is your God.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:12.240]   He is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.000]   who love him and keep his commandments."
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.860]   God is faithful to building healthy, good families.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.600]   Let me show you how by tying this all together.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.440]   I started this message by telling you about baby Sam, our foster baby.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.240]   Well, like I said, about nine months with us, he was matched to a family and we had
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:39.920]   the privilege of going through the gut-wrenching, heart-wrenching process of helping him transition
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.500]   out of our home into his forever family.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.720]   And saying goodbye to baby Sam will forever be one of the hardest things that we've ever
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.160]   had to do as a family.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.820]   But you know what?
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.240]   Throughout this process, we had one prayer.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:40:00.160]   Our prayer was that Sam would be adopted into a loving, healthy family and that somehow
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.680]   we would be able to stay in touch and be a part of his life.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:10.600]   Well, just like God showed us his love by adopting us into his family, Sam was adopted
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:16.000]   into the most perfect, beautiful family that I believe God was preparing for him.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.240]   He has parents that love him so well that are raising him up.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:28.480]   What might have been a story of brokenness has transformed into a story of redemption.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:33.000]   But here's something even cooler.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.160]   Not long after Sam left our home, God gave us our own child, Isaiah, whom I hope we're
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:44.720]   raising in a family that's filled with love and the presence of God is this as well.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.400]   And God answered our prayer.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.680]   He gave us even more than we could imagine or ask for.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:55.280]   He even answered our prayer by allowing us to stay in touch with Sam and his family.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.640]   And here's this picture of Sam now as a grown boy praying with our boy, Isaiah, just a couple
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.280]   of months ago.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:07.520]   Look at those cheeky faces, right?
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.540]   God loves families.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:16.440]   He loves your family and he wants to see the brokenness in your family healed.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:23.880]   He wants to see the generations of his love being passed down through the generations.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:29.520]   So my prayer is that every family here today, no matter what it looks like for you, would
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.240]   truly know God and his love.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.280]   I pray that we would learn how to love our family members and that we would find the
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.640]   remedy of a broken relationship within our families through loving each other as God
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.240]   has loved us.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.420]   And that through this, God would display his faithfulness through the generations until
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:53.200]   he returns or takes us home.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:42:03.360]   So church, I wonder if you would stand with me.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:07.680]   If you're here with your family today, maybe this is an opportunity just to hold each other,
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.920]   get close to each other right now, you know, with your spouse or with your kids.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.900]   I encourage you to do that.
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:18.960]   But I also know there might be people in today with, who don't have their families here with
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:24.120]   them, or maybe your family aren't here, or your earthly family is gone, you don't have
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.680]   an earthly family.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:32.920]   Or maybe like earlier I was saying, it's been so estranged, it's been a background of abuse,
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:38.120]   it's been a background of deep hurt.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.440]   If that's you, maybe grab some of your brothers, sisters in Christ around you and have them
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.800]   surrounding you right now.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:52.440]   Because there's families here going through the process of praying for children and wanting
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.720]   to have children but haven't been able to do that.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.560]   And God sees your pain in that as well.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.580]   Like I said, there's a whole variation of things, and I'm sorry I can't be able to touch
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.700]   on everything, but God knows.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.800]   God knows what your family is like.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:16.480]   But God loves your family so deeply.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:21.600]   As we pray, we remember, you know, in the Bible it's full of examples of broken families,
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.680]   of messed up situations, but God always somehow in the end redeems them by His wisdom and
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.520]   His love.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:35.280]   So let me pray for us.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:43.680]   Our Father in heaven, Lord we thank you that you are the true Father.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.440]   That all of us have a place in your home.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:56.360]   That nobody has been given up by you, but rather Lord you love us deeply, adopting us
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:01.860]   into your household, redeeming us by your blood.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:06.800]   Every single person in this room can call out to you, "Abba, Father, today, because
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.120]   of your love for us."
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.600]   And we thank you for that.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.960]   Father, I pray that this same love that you've given to us, Lord, would permeate every single
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:25.440]   home, every single family, every single situation right now.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:34.760]   That we would learn to love as you have loved, especially those in our family.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:39.680]   And that from this, Lord, from healthy, good families, from children being placed in homes
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:45.080]   that are safe and an environment where they can thrive, Lord, you are changing the world
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.880]   by your love in this way.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:53.600]   And that the generations to come would have stories of praise, would have testimonies
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:59.240]   of healing and of redemption because your love was at work in their families.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:04.520]   So we pray for ourselves, we pray for our parents, we pray for the generations to come
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:11.400]   after us, that we would truly feel your love at work in the lives of our homes and our
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:16.840]   families.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.840]   Thank you, Lord.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:18.840]   We love you, Father.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:19.840]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:20.340]   Amen.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:24.420]   In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
