00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
 - Thank you, Carla.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,840
 I've loved this series.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,540
 Week by week, we've received tips,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,460
 biblical examples,

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,800
 different voices,

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,440
 but with the same agenda,

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,600
 to help us grow spiritually,

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,020
 to flourish.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,680
 I do hope you've had the chance to check out

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,720
 the Spiritual Foundation Toolkit.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,760
 It's an excellent resource

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,320
 and takes over where these sermons leave off,

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,400
 so to speak.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,500
 And I get the honor to close this series.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,560
 But I must warn you,

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,440
 I am gonna talk today,

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,200
 I'm gonna talk to you today

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,060
 about a dirty word,

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,560
 shock horror, yes.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,460
 A dirty word.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,380
 And it's this,

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,580
 evangelism.

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,820
 I know you've been put off by tele-evangelists,

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,260
 over-hyped big stadium meetings

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,260
 and over-zealous Christians wearing witness t-shirts.

26
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,580
 I saw one this week, very topical,

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,020
 given the number of mosquitoes here in Hong Kong.

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,260
 And he said this,

29
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,860
 "I want to be so full of Christ

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,180
 that if a mosquito bites me,

31
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,740
 it flies away singing,

32
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,580
 'There is power in the blood.'"

33
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:46,220
 The worldwide church has been confused.

34
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,720
 Jesus had risen from the grave,

35
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,860
 was about to go to the Father

36
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,400
 and giving his disciples instruction

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,380
 as to how the work of the gospel would continue.

38
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,820
 But what we've done is we've taken this verse, Mark 16, 15,

39
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,140
 I'll read it to you.

40
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,720
 He said to them,

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,820
 "Go into all the world

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,100
 and preach the gospel to all creation."

43
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,960
 But what the church has done,

44
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,080
 has taken this verse,

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,860
 which describes the call to evangelism

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,260
 and made it seem like it only applies

47
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,740
 to those who we discern have a calling for it,

48
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,440
 those we deem to be evangelists.

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,780
 And I'm here today to tell you

50
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,780
 that Mark 16, 15 is not a command just for evangelists,

51
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,440
 but for all believers.

52
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,220
 In simple terms, you.

53
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,980
 Sir Irankine evangelist DT Niles simply puts it this,

54
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,980
 "Christianity is one beggar telling another beggar

55
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,620
 where he found bread."

56
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,760
 And to demonstrate that,

57
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,480
 I wanna look at a passage in 2 Kings 7.

58
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,280
 Some background.

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,500
 In that story, Jerusalem had been under siege

60
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,360
 and the people were about to die of starvation.

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,460
 Meanwhile, we read this, verse three.

62
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:43,600
 They said to each other, "Why stay here until we die?

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,220
 If we say we will go into the city,

64
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,540
 the famine is there and we will die."

65
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,300
 "And if we stay here, we will die."

66
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:01,180
 "So let's go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender."

67
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,980
 "If they spare us, we live."

68
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,300
 "If they kill us, then we die."

69
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,300
 Anyway, they went over to the camp

70
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,080
 and discovered that God had done something

71
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,360
 to frighten the attackers away,

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,500
 leaving food and precious possessions behind.

73
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,260
 Let's move on to verse eight.

74
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,400
 They ate, they drank,

75
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,600
 and they carried away silver, gold, and clothes,

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,040
 and went off and hid them.

77
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,900
 They returned and entered another tent

78
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,100
 and took some things from it and they hid them also.

79
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,700
 Then they said to each other, "We're not doing right."

80
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,460
 "This is a day of good news

81
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,280
 and we're keeping it to ourselves."

82
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,280
 "If we wait until the daylight, punishment will overtake us."

83
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,840
 "Let's go at once and report this to the royal palace."

84
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,620
 "This is a day of good news

85
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,940
 and we're keeping it to ourselves."

86
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,460
 We are like these beggars.

87
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,340
 Only in our case, we are spiritual beggars

88
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,140
 and we have found spiritual food.

89
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,840
 Then like the lepers, we then decide

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,300
 not to keep this good news to ourselves,

91
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,640
 but to share it with our starving neighbours.

92
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,540
 And that is the simplicity of witness.

93
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,180
 Christianity is one beggar telling another beggar

94
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,140
 where he found bread.

95
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,140
 Now to demonstrate, I have chosen an unlikely assistant

96
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,660
 to demonstrate how to witness.

97
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,700
 It's "Wall-E."

98
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,540
 "Wall-E."

99
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,160
 "Wall-E" was a 2008 film, an animated film,

100
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,440
 starring a robot who is designed to clean up

101
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,140
 an abandoned waste-covered earth.

102
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,860
 "Now you know me and acronyms, so I'm gonna start with W."

103
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,160
 "W" is for words.

104
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,020
 "1 Peter 3:15,

105
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,220
 'But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord.

106
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,260
 Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone

107
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,380
 who asks you to give the reason to the hope you have.'

108
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,540
 This does not mean stand up at your desk and work

109
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,940
 and preach a sermon, unless God specifically

110
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,260
 asks you to do that."

111
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,400
 Probably unlikely.

112
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,860
 But I wanna share with you some tips which have helped me.

113
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,300
 I was in the business world longer than I've been a pastor.

114
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,980
 Actually, I was a businessman almost as long

115
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,320
 as I've been a Christian.

116
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,140
 I love Jesse's talk on faith and the workplace.

117
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,860
 If you haven't heard it yet,

118
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,240
 I recommend you check it online.

119
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,100
 Now the trouble with being a pastor,

120
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,060
 most of my time these days is spent mainly with Christians.

121
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,340
 The famous inventor, Thomas Edison says this,

122
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,340
 "We often miss opportunity because it is dressed in overalls

123
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,860
 and looks like work."

124
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,860
 Now my first tip is this, fly your flag early.

125
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,980
 It is more difficult to do it later on.

126
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,460
 Now I'm gonna be honest with you.

127
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,260
 I used to cheat a little bit.

128
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,240
 I used to have a small cross on my jacket.

129
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,340
 Now that's not for everyone,

130
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,460
 but I wanna suggest a few quick ways

131
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,500
 that business people can fly their flag.

132
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,820
 To give you some practical ways you could do this

133
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,340
 in the office without making your colleagues feel

134
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,040
 they're getting bashed over their head with the Bible.

135
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,220
 Try a conversation.

136
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,960
 What did you do at the weekend?

137
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,060
 It gives you a chance to say something

138
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,100
 about being with Christian friends

139
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,180
 or a church event without being over religious.

140
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,020
 When someone is sick or has a problem,

141
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,460
 how can I pray for you?

142
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,300
 No one says no to prayer.

143
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,180
 And I had everyone from the tea lady to senior management

144
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,580
 asking for prayer for all sorts of things.

145
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,380
 Be an encourager.

146
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,420
 Don't get drawn into office politics,

147
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,100
 backbiting or negative talk.

148
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,100
 People will soon notice a difference in you and ask you why.

149
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,080
 Again, be gracious in sharing.

150
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,540
 Delay in flying your flag could lead to compromise.

151
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,380
 And then the realisation,

152
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,980
 oh, I didn't realise you were one of them.

153
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,740
 Secondly, make a connection.

154
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,920
 Find some common ground.

155
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,440
 People like to talk about things they are interested in.

156
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,900
 If we show an interest in the things

157
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,760
 that they are interested in,

158
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,120
 they may be more interested in what we have to say.

159
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,560
 When I was in sales,

160
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,240
 the first thing I did was look at someone's office,

161
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,980
 their desk, their bookshelf for clues.

162
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,840
 People like to talk about their hobbies, their families.

163
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,380
 Invite them out for a coffee or a better still happy hour

164
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,380
 to get to know them rather than just WhatsApping them

165
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,780
 with the latest church invitation.

166
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,440
 If I take someone out for lunch,

167
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,860
 I always start a conversation with the waiter or waitress.

168
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,300
 Learn a few simple words of Chinese, Tagalog, Nepalese.

169
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,460
 I particularly like Nepalese.

170
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,980
 I go into a restaurant, I go, "Namaste."

171
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,900
 Oh, "Namaste."

172
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,860
 And then I go, "Jai Masi," which is,

173
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,580
 they say, "Oh, that's a Christian greeting."

174
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,860
 I said, "Jai, are you a Christian?"

175
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,820
 'Cause we have a lot of Nepalese Christians at our church.

176
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,900
 The person who you are with is by this time engaged.

177
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:33,260
 I'd love to go on, but I wanna emphasise thirdly,

178
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,480
 look for opportunities.

179
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,820
 The Holy Spirit will give you windows.

180
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,120
 20 years ago, one of my team at work knocked on my door

181
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,320
 and asked me a question.

182
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,840
 I didn't know at the time she was thinking of leaving.

183
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,920
 She said, "How have you been able to stay

184
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,320
 at the same company for 25 years?"

185
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,960
 I gave an answer I would not normally recommend.

186
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,880
 I just said, "Jesus."

187
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,000
 And that prompted an hour or so of conversation

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,440
 at the end of which she prayed a prayer to receive Christ.

189
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,280
 And I prayed with her to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

190
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,880
 She came to the Vine.

191
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,320
 Her name is Wendy Lee.

192
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,800
 She is still very much part of the Vine.

193
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,440
 I baptised her in Repulse Bay,

194
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,040
 married her in Union Church

195
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,680
 and dedicated her son here at the Vine.

196
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,480
 I find aeroplane journeys a great opportunity.

197
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,800
 Do you remember aeroplanes?

198
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,640
 Yeah.

199
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,080
 You have a person's company for maybe 12 hours.

200
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,760
 I let it slip around takeoff that I'm a pastor

201
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,180
 or maybe I'm on my way to a Christian conference

202
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,560
 or mission trip.

203
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,560
 The result is either a long and interesting conversation.

204
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,280
 Otherwise, they soon pretend to fall asleep

205
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,320
 and ignore me for 12 hours.

206
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,800
 Fourthly, know your story.

207
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,240
 No story is better than yours.

208
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,840
 People can argue about theology

209
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,960
 but not your personal experience.

210
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,560
 What I mean is this, what I was like before I met Christ,

211
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,000
 how I met Christ and the difference He has made.

212
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,800
 In mission trip preparation, we do a one minute testimony.

213
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,200
 Find a friend somewhere and practise.

214
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,000
 We could call it the elevator pitch.

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,760
 But sometimes we don't need to say anything

216
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,440
 as A is for actions.

217
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,200
 Actions speak louder than words is a popular idiom.

218
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,760
 People say, "I don't believe what you say,

219
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,320
 "I believe what you do."

220
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,280
 All talk, no action.

221
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,000
 There is a danger when our words and actions

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,360
 don't match up, are inconsistent.

223
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,120
 The reality of our media driven age

224
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,520
 is where people are saying seems to have such a big impact.

225
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,360
 And oftentimes it's those who are keyboard warriors

226
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,200
 who are shaping the narrative of our cities and culture.

227
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,160
 I think there is a good reminder for all of us

228
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,440
 to live less online and more in the real world.

229
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,560
 To be more of a Christian in our everyday moments

230
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,840
 than pretending to be one online.

231
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,040
 There's a common Christian expression, go the extra mile.

232
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,080
 Jesus talked about it in Matthew 5:41.

233
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,840
 Jackie Pullinger says this,

234
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,040
 "God wants us to have soft hearts and hard feet."

235
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,740
 The trouble is so many of us have hard hearts and soft feet.

236
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,760
 We can be the extra mile people.

237
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,100
 And that follows very nicely into L is for life.

238
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,480
 People are put off Christianity,

239
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,040
 not by the person of Christ, but by his followers.

240
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,160
 That is so sad.

241
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,240
 Gandhi said this, "I like your Christ.

242
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,580
 "I do not like your Christians.

243
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,720
 "Your Christians are so unlike your Christ."

244
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,060
 But on the other hand, let me tell you about Joanna Chow.

245
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,500
 Joanna Chow at the time was our Vine administrator.

246
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,660
 More than 10 years ago was diagnosed with serious cancer.

247
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,260
 I wish I could report that she had been radically healed.

248
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,420
 And I know she had and has many struggles.

249
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,180
 But the way she has conducted herself

250
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,060
 has led to many of her family members

251
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,020
 to give their life to Jesus.

252
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,260
 And I know she is praying for the rest.

253
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,000
 The famous American evangelist D.L. Mooney says,

254
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,920
 "Out of a hundred people, one will read the Bible.

255
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,740
 "The other 99 will read the Christian."

256
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:55,580
 Our witness, our witness, our love, our actions,

257
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,100
 our words must be always with love.

258
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,180
 We cannot give what we haven't received.

259
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,180
 We receive to give away.

260
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,140
 We're not to be like the Dead Sea,

261
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,940
 which feeds nothing.

262
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,300
 But the River Jordan bringing life,

263
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,660
 it reflects our river model vision.

264
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,540
 Those we witness to can never be notches on our belts

265
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,740
 or KPIs on our scorecards when they respond.

266
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,500
 Paul says that without love,

267
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,860
 our witness is a noisy gong, a clanging cymbal.

268
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,220
 Ask God to pour out His love.

269
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,220
 Romans 5:5, "For those in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,

270
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,180
 "and the ends of the earth."

271
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,380
 After all, loving people is important,

272
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,140
 regardless of whether they end up

273
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,860
 saying the sinner's prayer or not.

274
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,140
 There is great value in loving people,

275
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,100
 regardless of the surface result.

276
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:01,140
 W plus A plus L plus L leads to E, evangelism.

277
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,500
 And I repeat, evangelism is one beggar

278
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,020
 telling another beggar where to find bread.

279
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,140
 And I'm gonna give you all an opportunity

280
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,820
 to put this into practise in a simple way.

281
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,860
 I wanna introduce the alpha opportunity,

282
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,420
 one beggar telling another beggar where to find bread.

283
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,940
 And my aim is this, for everyone

284
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,060
 who calls the Vyandale Home Church

285
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,060
 to invite at least one friend to Online Alpha.

286
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,660
 And I want you right now in your mind,

287
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,500
 or maybe write it down, think of that friend.

288
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,660
 And we pray in Jesus' Name, all of us,

289
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,980
 prayers across the city, across the world,

290
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,620
 for that one friend.

291
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,660
 We pray, Lord, that You'll give us the grace

292
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,660
 and the opportunity to invite them to Online Alpha.

293
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,860
 And so I've reached half time.

294
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,220
 At this stage, I wanna recommend a stage

295
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,220
 of going even further, the Spiritual Foundation Toolkit.

296
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,140
 It starts off with learning how to prepare

297
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,620
 your story and testimony.

298
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,720
 It follows some resources in how to start conversations

299
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,900
 about your faith.

300
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,680
 And there are some simple resources

301
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,660
 that you can help share with friends

302
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,020
 and a section on going deeper,

303
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,900
 a section on how to run Alpha

304
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,540
 and deal with difficult questions.

305
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,700
 But as we move into the second half today,

306
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,660
 you, particularly those of you that know me well,

307
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,780
 would not expect me to give a talk on evangelism

308
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,140
 without at least offering some sort of challenge.

309
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,300
 So what I wanna do is attempt to give you

310
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,220
 one of the best biblical examples

311
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,980
 on how to make a connection,

312
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,220
 but to use it to issue you with a personal challenge.

313
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,340
 And the connection point is in six short words.

314
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,180
 Will you give me a drink?

315
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,820
 Now I might be in trouble if I started going to stop

316
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,020
 to strangers in Hong Kong saying that,

317
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,780
 will you give me a drink?

318
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,900
 But in this instance, it led to one of history's

319
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,300
 most well-known conversion stories,

320
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,720
 which ended up with the words, come see a man.

321
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 Those words were uttered almost 2000 years ago by a woman.

322
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,120
 She said, come and see a man

323
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,640
 who told me everything I ever did.

324
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,200
 Could this be the Lord?

325
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,240
 Could this be the Messiah?

326
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,800
 John 4, 29.

327
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,760
 She was not just any woman.

328
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,160
 We know her today as the woman at the well.

329
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,220
 We have no idea of a name,

330
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,480
 but what we do know is firstly, she was an outcast.

331
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,800
 The Samaritans were hated by the Jews

332
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,440
 regarded as half breeds, pigs.

333
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,400
 What we also know is secondly, she had a questionable past.

334
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,240
 She had had five husbands

335
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,680
 and was living with a man, not a husband.

336
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,600
 What we also know is thirdly,

337
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,680
 she had her own ideas about how to worship God.

338
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,520
 In fact, for her, it wasn't about how, but where.

339
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,320
 Samaritans believed that God had to be worshipped

340
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,640
 on a particular mountain.

341
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,760
 Now I know that many of us here today

342
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,520
 may have felt like that in our lives,

343
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,560
 believing that to worship God,

344
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,600
 we had to go to this church, go to this place of worship,

345
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,200
 or behave in this way, even dress the right way.

346
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,280
 We can maybe all identify with a Samaritan woman,

347
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:44,520
 but this lady met a man, not just any man,

348
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,080
 not like the men who had abused her,

349
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,220
 seen her as an object for lust.

350
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,160
 This man's name was Jesus.

351
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,720
 He had taken a detour just to be there in Sychar

352
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
 at the well to meet her.

353
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,440
 We read that Jesus had to go through Samaria,

354
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,840
 but Jewish people would actually take a long detour

355
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,240
 to avoid going through Samaria.

356
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,400
 Such was their hatred of each other.

357
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,200
 So why did he have to go?

358
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,180
 He had to go because this woman was important to him.

359
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,560
 And I need to tell you that Jesus is here on Vine Church

360
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,200
 everywhere today, specifically to meet you.

361
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,020
 He is here because you are important to him.

362
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,960
 Now back to the well,

363
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,200
 Jesus' disciples had gone out to buy lunch.

364
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,480
 We read that Jesus was tired.

365
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,480
 He was fully human and sat down by a well.

366
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,560
 We read when a Samaritan woman came to draw water,

367
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,560
 Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?

368
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,120
 Will you give me a drink?"

369
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,360
 Now this was wrong.

370
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,880
 Jesus, a Jewish man, talking to a Samaritan,

371
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,280
 talking to a woman, talking to a woman with a past

372
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,960
 who was probably there at midday

373
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,980
 to avoid being seen by the village gossips.

374
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,320
 But you know, it was not about a drink he needed.

375
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,320
 It was all about what she needed.

376
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
 That was the connection point.

377
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,000
 That was my Nepalese waitress conversation.

378
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,320
 That was my time with Wendy Lee.

379
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,460
 And we witnessed a most bizarre conversation

380
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,500
 about a drink that Jesus didn't really want

381
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,360
 from a woman who didn't think he should be asking her,

382
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,840
 leading to a discussion which interplays

383
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,960
 between the water from the well

384
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,620
 and this thing called living water.

385
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,300
 Jesus said, she said to Jesus,

386
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,340
 "I don't know what this living water is,

387
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,700
 but it sounds like I should have some."

388
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,100
 Here at Jacob's well, after five husbands

389
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,180
 and living with a man, after a tragedy,

390
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,820
 a lifetime of tragedy and emptiness,

391
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,740
 disappointment and discouragement,

392
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,240
 sinfulness and spiritual thirst,

393
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,660
 she finally met a man.

394
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,580
 Not a man who took from her, but a man who gave to her.

395
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,380
 And what did he give to her?

396
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,380
 Life, eternal life, living water.

397
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,140
 Jesus said, if she drank the water from the well,

398
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,380
 she would be thirsty again in no time,

399
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,340
 especially in the midday humidity.

400
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,020
 I can understand that.

401
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,240
 Then Jesus said, if she drank this living water,

402
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,820
 she would never go thirsty again.

403
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,880
 No wonder she ran to the city and proclaimed to the men,

404
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,660
 the women wouldn't listen to her,

405
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,700
 "Come and see a man."

406
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,700
 Almost 2000 years later, on 28th of March, 2021,

407
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,860
 I say to you today, come and see a man.

408
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,860
 I wanna introduce to you my best friend, Jesus.

409
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,480
 You see, when this woman came to the well,

410
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,400
 she was a woman with a past.

411
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,240
 As she left the well and went back to the town,

412
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,880
 she was a woman with a future.

413
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,040
 You may have logged into church everywhere today

414
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,920
 as someone with a past.

415
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,120
 To be honest, we've all done things

416
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,680
 that we know to be wrong.

417
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,640
 The Bible tells us this very clearly.

418
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,560
 But there is good news.

419
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,400
 The Jesus who met the woman at the well is here.

420
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,480
 His Holy Spirit is present and wants to meet you.

421
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,640
 He wants to fill you.

422
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,960
 And He wants to send you away from this meeting

423
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,120
 on Facebook Live or YouTube,

424
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,400
 not as someone with a past, but as someone with a future.

425
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,960
 He has a plan for your life,

426
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,600
 no matter how good or bad you've been,

427
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,040
 whether you've been going to church all of your life,

428
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,680
 or this is the first time you've ever logged in

429
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,520
 to a Christian website.

430
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,600
 He says one word.

431
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,440
 Come.

432
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,040
 Come.

433
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,760
 Come as you are.

434
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,200
 Don't wait until you think you're good enough.

435
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,260
 You will never be good enough.

436
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,640
 But there is just one thing.

437
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,000
 And it's a big thing.

438
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 He wants all of you.

439
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,520
 The Bible says, if you cling onto your life,

440
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,880
 you will lose it.

441
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,780
 But if you give up your life for me, you will find it.

442
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,660
 My friend, you have a choice.

443
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,900
 Hold on to your old life.

444
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,900
 I understand it.

445
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,340
 You love it so much, you don't want to change.

446
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,340
 We become comfortable.

447
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,660
 Even in our sinful ways, we become comfortable.

448
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,660
 But the Bible says, if we want to cling onto our past,

449
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,260
 our guilt, our shame, it's a no-win.

450
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,060
 The woman of the world could have done that.

451
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,060
 She could have resisted the free gift

452
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,100
 of what Jesus described as living water.

453
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,960
 But Jesus says today, come.

454
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,100
 If you want to be like the woman at the well,

455
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,700
 be a person who arrived online with a past,

456
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,020
 and you want to log off as a person with a future,

457
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,780
 I'm gonna ask you to take that small step.

458
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,940
 Come and see a man.

459
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,340
 I'm not gonna promise you a life

460
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,580
 that is free from trouble, a bed of roses.

461
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,580
 But what I will promise you is freedom from your past,

462
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,740
 your wrongdoings forgiven, the love of the Father,

463
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,300
 the presence and the filling of the Holy Spirit

464
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,820
 to lead you and the gift of eternal life.

465
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,780
 And a relationship with a God who says,

466
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,860
 I will never leave you.

467
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,060
 I will never forsake you.

468
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,700
 The next few minutes could determine

469
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,140
 where you spend eternity, and that's a long time,

470
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,780
 and how you spend the rest of your life here on earth.

471
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,780
 And maybe not just you, but also the friends

472
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,660
 that each one of us is going to invite to Alpha.

473
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,780
 If I may, can I ask you just to close your eyes

474
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,980
 wherever you are?

475
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,980
 And I'm gonna give you that opportunity now,

476
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,740
 the opportunity that Jesus gave to that lady at the well.

477
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,140
 Come and see a man.

478
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,100
 Today on this Palm Sunday,

479
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,020
 what a day to say goodbye to your past

480
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,340
 and hello to my future.

481
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,500
 Let's pray together.

482
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:48,300
 Father God, I come to You now as somebody who has a past.

483
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,460
 I have done things in my life I am ashamed of.

484
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,660
 I have done things in my life I know are wrong.

485
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,220
 I believe that You sent Jesus to die for me upon the cross,

486
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,900
 to forgive my sins, to give me a hope and a future.

487
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,860
 Lord Jesus, I give You my life now.

488
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,700
 I'm not perfect, Lord.

489
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:22,320
 I give You what I have and ask You, Lord, to take my life,

490
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:27,820
 forgive my sins, fill me with Your Spirit

491
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,100
 that I might receive this living water.

492
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:40,200
 Help me today, Lord, not just to receive You for myself,

493
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,140
 but to share You with those around me.

494
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,080
 I pray now for those I work with,

495
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,740
 those I travel on the bus or the MTR with,

496
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,240
 for my family, for my friends.

497
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,740
 I pray one day, Lord,

498
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,200
 we will see them all face to face in heaven,

499
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,380
 looking back to the day when we said to them,

500
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,740
 come and see a man.

501
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,740
 I pray this in Jesus' name.

502
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,180
 Amen.

503
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,980
 I realise we're not all face to face today.

504
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,340
 I'm gonna ask you just a couple of things

505
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,660
 for those who responded.

506
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,660
 If you prayed that prayer,

507
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,700
 particularly if you prayed it for the first time,

508
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,060
 please tell someone.

509
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,220
 It doesn't matter who that person is to an extent,

510
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,980
 but please tell someone that you prayed that prayer.

511
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,620
 Secondly, for those who are watching online,

512
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,740
 we have a chat box.

513
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,220
 And if you just type the word, yes, Y-E-S,

514
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,660
 into the chat box,

515
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,720
 one of our pastors will spend that time with you,

516
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,660
 will come back and help you on the next steps

517
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,860
 that you have to make.

518
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,820
 So firstly, tell someone.

519
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,660
 Secondly, if you're online, put Y-E-S in the chat box.

520
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,280
 And thirdly, if you're watching the recording,

521
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,620
 we have these connect cards

522
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,100
 and you'll see a QR code appearing

523
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,900
 on the screen at the moment.

524
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,340
 Fill in that connect card

525
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,540
 and we would love to contact with you,

526
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,180
 love to invite you on Alpha.

527
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,240
 There's lots of things in store for you.

528
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,740
 But for all of you who prayed that prayer,

529
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,980
 God bless you.

530
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,920
 This is the first day of the rest of your life.

531
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,540
 And you leave here today,

532
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,340
 not as a person with a past,

533
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,980
 but a person with a future.

534
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,860
 And for the rest of us,

535
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,580
 let's go into the whole world

536
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,300
 to share the good news of Jesus Christ.

537
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,180
 Amen.
