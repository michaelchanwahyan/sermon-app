1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 I don't know about you guys, but for me, when I face a problem or a challenge,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 I go into action mode.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 So I'm the action mode guy.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 I want to resolve the issue, I want to get rid of the chaos,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 maybe reestablish equilibrium, and I just go for it.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And it doesn't matter what type of problem it is.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 It might be something related to relationships,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 maybe it has to do with work.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I just go for it and try to resolve it.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I'm just actually curious, is there anybody like me here?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Like people who go into action mode.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Yeah, a little bit? Okay.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 So I'm that type of person.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Now, of course, sometimes I come across an issue, a challenge, a struggle

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 that I'm not able to resolve by going into full action mode,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 where I'm not able to address whatever's going on.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 And I just find myself in this waiting period.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I feel like that's all I can do.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I can just wait for something to change.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And I wonder if some of you are perhaps feeling this way right now,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 that there is a challenge, there is a struggle,

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 there is something where you're waiting for a breakthrough

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 that is happening in your life.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Maybe it's relationship, maybe it's emotionally, maybe it's health-related,

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 where you just feel stuck.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 But it doesn't matter what you do,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 you're not able yourself to address it or resolve it.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And so you're also in this place of waiting.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And so what I want to do with you today,

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 what I want to explore with you today is this question.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 How do we wait for God to act and move in our lives when we feel stuck?

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Is there a way that we're meant to wait?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Is there something how our faith is supposed to look like in these time periods?

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And so that's what I want to explore with you through today's message.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 We're going to continue through in the sermons here is the story of Joseph.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And let me just briefly set the context for maybe,

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 you know, some of you weren't here last week.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 So basically what's been going on is Joseph, he's had a rough going, right?

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I mean, he got enslaved, sold into slavery by his brothers,

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 and he's in part of his household where things seem to be going a little bit better.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And then his wife, or not his wife, part of his wife,

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 she accuses him essentially of rape, falsely accuses him,

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 and then he's thrown into prison.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Now, we were told that the Lord was with Joseph and that he showed him kindness.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 So despite being in this difficult circumstance of Joseph, you know, God is with Joseph,

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 but man, it's rough, it's not easy.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And so we're right now going to pick up where Joseph is in prison.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So he's in a period of waiting, and let me take you there.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Genesis chapter 40, verse 1, starting with 1, it says this.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 "Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 In the same prison where Joseph was confined, the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph,

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 and he attended to them."

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 So we learn that the baker and the cupbearer, which are very high-ranking officials,

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 it might not sound like it, but they're actually very important roles.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 They're like the elite in Egypt, and they somehow, they take off, they make Pharaoh angry.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 We don't know why, and so they're thrown into the jail.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Now what's interesting is that the prison is called the house of the captain of the guard.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Now Paddafor, in the previous chapter, is called the captain of the guard.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So it seems like that this prison might have been attached even to Paddafor's house.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Paddafor basically put Joseph in prison right where he's living,

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 and he's actually in charge and overseeing this prison.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So he assigns Joseph to take care of and look after these two prisoners.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Now what's interesting is that we're told that Joseph attends to the cupbearer and the baker.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 In the word "attend," it's "sharet," and it also means "to minister and to serve."

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 So Joseph is assigned to them, but he's also ministering and serving them.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 So let's find out, let's look at what does it mean that he's ministering and serving them.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 So we're going to continue in verse 4, and it says this.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 "Now after they had been in custody for some time, each of the two men,

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, were being held in prison,

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 So he asked various officials who were in custody with him in his master's house,

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 'Why do you look so sad today?'

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 'We both had dreams,' they answered, 'but there is no one to interpret them.'

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Then Joseph said to them, 'Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.'"

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 So we're told the cupbearer and the baker, they have these dreams, they look sad.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 It's actually quite amazing that Joseph notices and picks up on that they're not doing well,

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 and asks them, so I just want us to think about this for a moment.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 When you have a rough going in your life, when you are going through something difficult,

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I think a lot of times it's very easy to be self-focused.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 It's very easy to be absorbed with what's going on in our own lives.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And it would be perfectly legitimate and okay to actually not really pick up on

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 how somebody else is doing as you're going through something difficult.

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So it's amazing that Joseph actually notices what's going on in the cupbearer and the baker's life.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It's quite amazing that he's able to rise above his circumstances, his own challenges,

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 his own difficulty, and to ask them and express care to them with what's troubling them.

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And so then they tell him what's troubling them.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 They say, 'We both had dreams, but there is no one to interpret them.'

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 So the problem is that they don't have an interpreter to their dreams.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 So this dream, somehow they both knew this dream had some significance, had some meaning,

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 but there's nobody there to help them interpret it.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Now, what you have to know about Egyptians during that time is that they had dream interpreters.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 So in that culture, they had dream interpreters.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 You would tell them your dream, then they would look through commentaries,

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 dream commentaries, and would come back to you with a meaning of what this dream means.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 But because the cupbearer and the baker are in prison, they're not able,

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 they don't have access to that. So they're like stuck.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 It's like almost as if somebody gives you a diagnosis and says, 'You have phabla shlabda.'

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And you're like, 'What does phabla shlabda mean? What does that mean? Tell me, doctor!'

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So they're waiting for an explanation of what this actually means.

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And it's incredible because Joseph, it would have been quite natural or easy for him to say,

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 'Let me pause you right there.'

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Actually, I love that phrase. 'Let me pause you right there.'

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 It's like when somebody starts going somewhere and you don't want them to go there.

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 You say, 'Let me pause you right there.'

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 So if I ever use that on you, I'm sorry. 'Let me pause you right there.'

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 So it would have made sense for Joseph to say that. 'Let me pause you right there.'

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Because they're talking about dreams. And remember Joseph's story?

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 He had not so great experience with dreams.

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 When he shared the dreams with his family about them bowing down before him,

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 that's what kind of got him into this pit, into this dungeon, into this prison in the first place.

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 So it would have been not a surprise if he said, 'You know what? I wanted to help you,

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 but I don't really want to talk about dreams. I don't think you should worry about dreams.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Dreams, shmeams, they just don't come true. So just don't worry about it.'

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 But again, that's not what Joseph does.

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 So what does Joseph do?

119
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 His response is, 'Do not interpretations belong to God. Tell me your dreams.'

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Wow, that's amazing.

121
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 So Joseph, he does not need commentaries and things because he has a relationship with God,

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 and the interpretation belongs to God.

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And because he has this relationship with God, God will help him to interpret the dreams.

124
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 But you know what's even more amazing?

125
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 It's actually that this is a total statement of faith.

126
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Joseph, in this dark moment, he actually has never let go of his faith.

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 He's holding on to his faith in God.

128
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 He's holding on to the dream that God has spoken over his life.

129
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 He has not given up on it, because if he had given up on it,

130
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 he would not want to interpret dreams. He would want nothing to do with it.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 So this is absolutely incredible.

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 This word that God has spoken over Joseph, this dream,

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 even though his circumstances around him seem to scream, 'That dream is never going to come true,'

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Joseph is still holding on in faith, in hope, to what God has spoken to him.

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 So that means that he somehow must have continued to connect with God,

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 because you don't hold on to dreams unless you pour into that relationship,

137
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 unless you draw near, and keep drawing near, and keep talking to God about what's going on.

138
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Otherwise, you let go of the words that God has spoken.

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And so, in Joseph, he's living this time, he's been given a word,

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 but it hasn't been fulfilled, so he's living in this in-between tension.

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And I think we can relate to that. A lot of us, we live in this in-between time,

142
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 where we know there's something that God wants to do, or we're waiting on God to do something,

143
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 but we find ourselves living in a tension that's the 'not yet.'

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 But he's holding on to faith.

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And I believe there are some of us here today that God wants to encourage you to hold on to your faith,

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 to not give up, whether it's a promise from Scripture, from God's word,

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 whether it's maybe God has given you a personal word.

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 I believe that God wants to encourage you to not give up on what he has spoken to you,

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 to hold on, to keep your faith, to keep your hope in him,

150
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 because he is worthy of our hope.

151
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 He is worthy of our trust.

152
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Now, I want to share a little bit of a personal story for me.

153
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 The Joseph story kind of lends itself to, I'm sorry that I keep talking about this,

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 but basically, a lot of you know I've went through a very traumatic, difficult personal experience.

155
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I was left in a relationship.

156
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And so, six months into that time, I remember my bank account is dwindling.

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 I don't have a job.

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 I don't really know what I'm going to do next, or if I can, you know,

159
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 can I even re-enter ministry and do all of that?

160
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And so I'm in this in-between time.

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I'm really stuck.

162
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And so I went and I prayed and read God's word,

163
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 and I really received a word from the Lord, a personal word from the Lord.

164
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And he told me that I will establish you in my time.

165
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Wow.

166
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 That was amazing.

167
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And that encouraged me so much, yet it also kind of scared me,

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 because it said "my time."

169
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And I like things right now, right?

170
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Because I'm the action mode guy, and I want to do things and part my effort and make stuff happen.

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 But it was so powerful.

172
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 So God spoke this word over my life.

173
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And it was something I can't tell you how many times I've gone back to this word.

174
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And when I look back at where I am now, man, God has been so good.

175
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 He has been faithful.

176
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 He has fulfilled his word to me.

177
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 He has blessed me with an incredible wife, Chris.

178
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And together we have a beautiful daughter, Ellie.

179
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And I'm able to--the pastor--man, God is so good.

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 He's so faithful.

181
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 But it was years.

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 It wasn't resolved in a week.

183
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 But I just want to encourage you.

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 If you're in that in-between time, if you're in that waiting time,

185
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 man, God wants to--he's faithful to his promise.

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 I actually had a scripture from Romans.

187
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Paul, writing to the Romans Christians, he says this, and he's quoting the prophet Isaiah.

188
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 As scripture says, "Anyone who believes in him will be never put to shame."

189
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 When we place our trust in Jesus, when we run to Jesus, as we were singing earlier, so beautiful,

190
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 and we trust him, we are never put to shame.

191
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 He will come through for you.

192
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 He will do what he promises he will do in your life.

193
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And he's with you, and he will get you through.

194
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Isn't that a beautiful word?

195
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 You know, we will never be put to shame when we place our trust in Jesus?

196
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 You know, that his word over our lives will come to pass?

197
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Oh, it's amazing.

198
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 So Joseph, he's been holding on to his word, his dream that's been spoken over his life.

199
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 He's holding on to his promise of God, even though everything around him doesn't seem like it's going to come to pass.

200
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Actually, it seems quite the opposite, that the opposite is happening.

201
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And then he tells the cupbearer and the baker, "Tell me your dreams."

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And he's willing to interpret them.

203
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 So let's see what happens next.

204
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Verse 9.

205
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dreams.

206
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 He said to him, "In my dream, I saw a vine in front of me, and on the vine were three branches,

207
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 and as soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its cluster ripened in the grapes.

208
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, and I squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup,

209
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 and put the cup in his hand."

210
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 "That is what it means," Joseph said to him, "that three branches are three days.

211
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Within three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position,

212
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 and you will be put Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were a cupbearer."

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 So Joseph gives a very clear interpretation to the dream.

214
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Cupbearer, you're going to be restored back into the graces of Pharaoh.

215
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 You're going to be serving him again.

216
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 You know, an incredible, encouraging, beautiful word.

217
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Then Joseph, he also seizes this moment, and he actually makes a request.

218
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 So let's look at that in verse 14.

219
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 "But when all goes well with you," says Joseph's dream, "remember me and show me kindness.

220
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.

221
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews,

222
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon."

223
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 To be put in a pit is actually the same word, dungeon, as the pit, the cistern,

224
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 that Joseph was thrown in by his brothers.

225
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 So after interpreting the dream, Joseph, he seizes that opportunity,

226
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 because he knows that he's going to be restored back to Pharaoh.

227
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 This also speaks of the type of access that the cupbearer has to Pharaoh.

228
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 It shows the importance of his position.

229
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 When you can make a personal request to Pharaoh, you're pretty close to him.

230
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 You have some sway.

231
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And so he asks him to help him.

232
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 But it also is the first time that Joseph actually speaks of his own trauma in his life.

233
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 It's the first time that he verbalizes it.

234
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And he's expressing to the cupbearer his innocence.

235
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 "Get me out of here. I've been treated unjustly.

236
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Plead for me with Pharaoh."

237
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Now, some scholars, they say that Joseph here is trying to make stuff happen out of his own strength.

238
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 He's trying to make things happen on his own instead of relying and trusting in God.

239
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 But I don't think that that is a fair judgment or assessment of what's going on.

240
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 The way I interpret it is that Joseph senses that God is somewhere at work

241
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 through what's happening here with this relationship.

242
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And so it's like a ray of light in this darkness.

243
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Or like earlier we were talking about the storm and the sea.

244
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 It's like seeing that first ray of light and you're like running towards it and seizing that moment.

245
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 And so he makes this request.

246
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 But let's continue what happens next.

247
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And this is about the baker.

248
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 So in verse 16.

249
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 "When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation,

250
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 he said to Joseph, 'I too had a dream.

251
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 On my head, three baskets of bread.

252
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh.

253
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 But the birds were eating them out of the big basket on my head.'

254
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 'This is what it means,' Joseph said.

255
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 'The three baskets are three days.

256
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Within three days, Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole

257
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 and the birds will eat away your flesh.'"

258
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Hmm.

259
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Maybe he wished he would have not asked what does this dream mean.

260
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 But what I want you to notice in this moment is that Joseph,

261
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 in both instances, he actually reveals and says what God asked him to show.

262
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 And that's not easy, right?

263
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 To deliver such a difficult message, it will be easy to kind of soften it

264
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 or change it because you just don't interpersonally want to deal with

265
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 delivering that type of message.

266
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 But it also just shows again that Joseph is faithful

267
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 and trusts God with what he says, and he just does what God asks him to do.

268
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 So that's a--

269
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And one more thing.

270
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 In both interpretations, they're not like, "Let me interpret your dream."

271
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Something is going to happen to you on some day, in some way,

272
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 and will somehow impact your life.

273
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 That could mean anything, right?

274
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 It's so vague, it doesn't mean anything.

275
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 But Joseph's interpretation of a dream is super specific.

276
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 It's like in three days.

277
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 In three days, everyone's going to know whether or not he interpreted a dream correctly.

278
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And so let's see if he did.

279
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Continuing in verse 20.

280
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 "Now the third day was Joseph's birthday, and he gave a feast for all the officials.

281
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker

282
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 in the presence of his officials.

283
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 He restored the chief cupbearer to his position

284
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 so that he once again put the cup in the pharaoh's hand.

285
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 But he impaled the chief baker just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.

286
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph.

287
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 He forgot him."

288
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 So Joseph's interpretation was correct.

289
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 It came to pass what he said.

290
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 He heard from God correctly.

291
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And we can only imagine on Joseph's end,

292
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 he didn't have the narrative telling him that the cupbearer forgot him,

293
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 but on his end, we just picture him eagerly waiting.

294
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 He knows there's going to be somebody, my cell is going to be opened,

295
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 and somebody is going to get me out and bring me before Pharaoh,

296
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 and I'm going to be innocent, and everything is going to be great,

297
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 and God's dreams are going to come to pass.

298
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 A week passes, nothing happens.

299
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Okay, he needed some time to settle back in his new job.

300
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Two weeks pass, nothing happens.

301
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 That's okay, still okay timeline.

302
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 A month, two months, three months, six months, a year.

303
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Oh man, he forgot me.

304
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Now, next week, we're going to see that after two years, he does remember.

305
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 But it took another two years.

306
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 But I believe that Joseph was nonetheless encouraged,

307
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 even though he was discouraged by that, but I think he was encouraged.

308
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Let me tell you why.

309
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Because he interpreted God's dream correctly,

310
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 and the dream that God gave to the cupbearer and the baker,

311
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 it came to pass.

312
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 So that gave him assurance about this dream that God had spoken to him,

313
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 that it will also come to pass.

314
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 That he had not wrongly interpreted,

315
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 but that he had heard rightly from the Lord.

316
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 So I think there was that encouragement to hold on and to have faith,

317
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 and to keep going for him there.

318
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Now, all of this brings me back to the question that I raised at the beginning of this message,

319
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 which is how do we wait for God to act and move in our lives when we feel stuck?

320
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 How are we meant to wait on God?

321
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 And what does Joseph's story, his life, what does that tell us?

322
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 What insights does it give us?

323
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 What encouragement does it give us?

324
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Well, it's interesting because when we think of waiting,

325
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 I picture I was one time in a theme park,

326
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 and I waited three or four hours in line to do one ride.

327
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Anyone?

328
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 It was not a lot of fun.

329
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And so that's like a lot of times how we picture waiting, right?

330
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 It's like you're waiting in line for a restaurant,

331
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 and time just passes, and then you get to sit,

332
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 or you get to go on the ride, and that's it.

333
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 But biblically speaking, waiting is not passive, but it's something that's active.

334
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 We're meant to wait actively.

335
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Now, what might this look like to wait actively, and how do we see this in Joseph?

336
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Well, first, when we wait on the Lord, we actively draw close to him.

337
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 We commune with him and cling to his word and his promises.

338
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 It's easy when things are not going very well to kind of stop our relationship with God

339
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 and put it on--let me pause you right there.

340
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 But actually waiting involves actively seeking God,

341
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 actively speaking to God about what's going on.

342
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Even if it is like pouring out a frustration to him, God can handle it.

343
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 You don't have to say things pretty to him.

344
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 You can just tell him what you're feeling, what you're experiencing,

345
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 and just put it out there.

346
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 In biblical language, it's called lament, when you're just pouring out and sobbing

347
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 and telling him, "God, help me. Why are you putting me through--?"

348
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 You can do that. God can handle it. It's okay.

349
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And so we're meant to draw close, and when we draw close, it's always amazing

350
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 because God meets us. He speaks to us.

351
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 I shared earlier my story. God spoke to me. I drew close to him.

352
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 I'm talking about six months in that I had this word.

353
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 It's not like I always have this, but he spoke to me when I read his word.

354
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And so when we're waiting, it's not just us sitting there or standing.

355
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 I guess in the Hongwan Langnaam, standing, you're not going to have a seat

356
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 when you're waiting for the restaurant most of the time.

357
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 You're going to wait, but it's not waiting passively, but we're waiting actively

358
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 through prayer, through engaging in our relationship with God.

359
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And when we do that, God meets us, and he speaks to us, and he wants to encourage you,

360
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 and he wants to pour his grace over you, and he wants to renew your faith,

361
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 your strength, and just encourage you in that.

362
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And we see that with Joseph because his faith is so strong and vibrant.

363
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 So he had held on to it. He has been drawing near.

364
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Otherwise, there is not that vibrancy when you're in such a dark pit,

365
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 but yet you're still holding on to the promises of God.

366
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 But then the second thing of waiting that we learned from Joseph is waiting actively

367
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 means to stay available for God to work in and through you.

368
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 So just because we're in this in-between time where we're waiting for this one issue

369
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 to be resolved does not mean that God does not want to do something in us and through us.

370
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And it's like Joseph, he made himself available to God.

371
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 He rose above his circumstances, and he ministered, and he served the cupbearer in the bakery.

372
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 He asked them, "You look sad. What's going on?"

373
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 He's caring. And it's incredible that when we make ourselves available to care for others--

374
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Now, I need to say this to you.

375
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Sometimes we're doing so bad, like we're not able to do that, and that is okay.

376
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 But there is a point usually where we are able to do that, where we are able to be available.

377
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 And when we do that, it actually is amazing how a lot of times it gives us a perspective shift

378
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 when we serve somebody else in need, when we care for somebody else in need.

379
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 When we make ourselves available to God, God gives us a different perspective.

380
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 He encourages us.

381
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 So I want to share with you also an experience that I had.

382
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Again, same life period.

383
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 I had just stepped down from being a pastor, but there was still a course like Alpha--

384
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 It was not Alpha, but something like that--still going on.

385
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 So I said, "What do I do?"

386
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 "Are there a few people in there? Do I continue teaching it?"

387
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 "Do I just say, 'Hey, I have so much turmoil in my life. I'm sorry I can't do it.'"

388
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And I really wrestled with that, but I felt led to keep teaching this course.

389
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And in that course, there was a Chinese scholar.

390
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 So I was living in San Diego. It was University of California, San Diego.

391
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 She was doing some program there.

392
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 And at first, she just came to our church and joined this course

393
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 because she was just like, "Hey, I'm here in the U.S. I might as well explore what Christianity is all about."

394
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And then as we're going through this course and reading God's Word,

395
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 suddenly there was a switch where it was amazing how she understood Scripture

396
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 and what she shared. It was like, "Wow, God is working."

397
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 There was a light switch being turned on in her heart, in her life.

398
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 And so I thought that on the last session that she would become a Christian,

399
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 that she would place her faith in Jesus, but it didn't happen.

400
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 It didn't happen. I was actually quite surprised because all the signs were there,

401
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 that there was something happening inside of her.

402
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 But she did ask a question, and she asked the question,

403
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 "How can I know that Jesus really exists, that he's real?"

404
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And I said, "Well, you can pray to him. You can ask him to reveal himself to you,

405
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 and he will do that. He will show himself to you."

406
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So that's where we left off.

407
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Now, a while later, probably a month or so after this course, I got an email.

408
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And I'm going to read you some parts of it. I edited it a little bit for privacy's sake,

409
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 but I want to read some parts of that email to you.

410
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 So here's what she wrote.

411
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 "Dear Tim, I want to write to you a very long time ago,

412
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 but I didn't know how to express myself properly.

413
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Since I had attended your Bible study class, I've changed so much,

414
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 which could not be predicted, explained by myself.

415
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 I remembered when I asked you how to know Jesus does exist,

416
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 you said Jesus will show himself to you.

417
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 That's absolutely true.

418
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 I received the gift, and I decided to be baptized,

419
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 and it will be the day I am reborn in Jesus Christ.

420
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And I want to share this news with you because you helped me and inspired me so much,

421
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 and I cannot thank you enough.

422
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 I know it's God's plan to let me join in your class,

423
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 and the Holy Spirit changes my mind and helps me find purpose in life.

424
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 I feel so blessed and cannot stop praising the Father.

425
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I would like to invite you to my baptism, if you have time."

426
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 I had time.

427
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 "I know you might be very busy and have a lot of change in your life."

428
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 She knew what was going on.

429
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 "That's okay.

430
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 If you cannot come, because I know that you must be very happy for me,

431
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 I prayed, pray, and will pray for you and your future life."

432
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 And she had some other encouraging words, which for me was so amazing.

433
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Here is somebody who just becomes a Christian,

434
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 and she's encouraging this pastor, ex-pastor,

435
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 going through an extremely difficult time in his life.

436
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I have a photo for you guys.

437
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 I also chose one that kind of hides it.

438
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 I'm in the house, and I get God to baptize her.

439
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 For me, actually what you don't know is for me I was asking the question,

440
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 "Will God ever work through me in my life again?

441
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Will I ever be a pastor again?"

442
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And from here, God, I made myself available.

443
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 It was totally not convenient.

444
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 And God worked through my life, and he showed me,

445
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 "Yes, Tim, I'm going to use you."

446
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 And I can't tell you how encouraging that was,

447
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 while I was in this period of waiting,

448
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 to know that God was not finished with me,

449
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 that he is still working through me and working in my life,

450
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 and that there is more to come.

451
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 So it was so encouraging.

452
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 So through the story of Joseph, through his own waiting,

453
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 we're encouraged to draw near, to talk to God, to read his word.

454
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 But we're also encouraged to make ourselves available to serve others,

455
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 because when we do that, God encourages us.

456
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 He gives us a different perspective than we have.

457
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 And so that's how God works in our lives, how he moves.

458
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 It's amazing. He is so good.

459
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Now, I want to invite the worship team to come up.

460
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And I know that some of you here--

461
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Oh, I almost threw this thing down on the ground.

462
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 I know that some of you here, you find yourself in this period of waiting,

463
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 and some of you are--actually, you're still exploring faith.

464
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Like, you know, I'm not so sure about Jesus.

465
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Maybe your spouse brings you. Maybe you come because of your friends.

466
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Maybe you're on this journey.

467
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 And I--you know, experiencing--

468
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 having Jesus with you in the waiting, for me, makes all the difference.

469
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 I really don't know how you wait without Jesus,

470
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 you know, without knowing his presence, without knowing his love,

471
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 without knowing his care, without experiencing him speak to you and meet you

472
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 and the difficulty and challenge that's going on.

473
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 So I want to encourage you, actually, to join the Alpha.

474
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 It's starting March 25th, the English one, 7.30 to 9.30.

475
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 And I want to encourage you to do that.

476
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Maybe you've been thinking about this for a while, but you never do it.

477
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 I might not know--you know, I could invite Brian,

478
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 but maybe I don't know who you are.

479
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 And I just want to encourage you, now is the time. Why wait?

480
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Just explore it for yourself. Make up your own mind.

481
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Come and sign up for that.

482
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 And if you don't like it, honestly, you don't have to continue coming.

483
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Just come, and if you don't like it, you step away.

484
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 But I believe that when you do and when you pray like the lady did,

485
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 you know, that Jesus will reveal himself to you.

486
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 And he is the one who loves you, who is for you,

487
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 and who will walk with you through whatever challenge that you're going through.

488
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 And walking with Jesus will make all the difference.

489
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 You know, will make all the difference.

490
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 But I also know that many of us here are Christians, and we are followers of Jesus,

491
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 and we're still in this period of waiting.

492
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 We still go through difficult things, you know, whatever that might be.

493
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 You know, maybe it's a health-related thing, maybe it's a relationship thing,

494
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 maybe it's a finance thing, you know, whatever else.

495
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And I actually just want to encourage you right now to--

496
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 we're going to just give a moment, you know, for you to draw near.

497
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 You can do that on your own. You can turn to somebody next to you,

498
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 somebody you came with, and just pray together or pray on your own.

499
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Just pour out your heart to God and talk to him about this waiting season that you're in.

500
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 And then in a minute or so, I'm going to come back and I'm going to pray over us.

501
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 So let's just take this moment to pray.

502
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 I want to invite everyone to stand.

503
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 And if you--you know, you're in this waiting period,

504
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 you're needing this breakthrough from Jesus in your life,

505
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 I just want to encourage you to just stretch out your hands just as a sign,

506
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 "Jesus, I need you. Just come meet me."

507
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And I want to just pray over you.

508
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Jesus, I thank you so much that you love every single person here.

509
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 I thank you that you are the one who is with us.

510
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Holy Spirit, I pray right now that you will make your presence known to everyone

511
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 who is going through difficult and challenging circumstances,

512
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 that you make your presence known, that they know you are with them.

513
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 They are not alone. You love them.

514
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 And Lord, I also pray that you would raise faith,

515
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 that you would raise hope in you,

516
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 that you're the God who is faithful to his promise,

517
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 that anyone who trusts in you will not put them to shame.

518
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And so, Jesus, I pray that you strengthen my brothers and my sisters

519
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 to hold on to you in this challenging season.

520
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 I pray that you meet them. I also pray that you provide for them.

521
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 I pray that you see them through.

522
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Lord, I also want to pray for community.

523
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 I want to pray that you place people around my brothers and sisters

524
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 to walk with, to share things with, that they know they are not alone.

525
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 There is others praying with them, encouraging them, Lord.

526
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 So I pray that you lift up, that you encourage my brothers and sisters.

527
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And Holy Spirit, I just pray right now that you fill everyone with your presence, Lord.

528
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 For some of us, our tank's been empty.

529
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 So Holy Spirit, will you right now fill your people with your presence?

530
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Thank you.

531
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 And so we entrust all that is going on to you, knowing that you are good,

532
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 and that you are with us, and that you will see us through.

533
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.

534
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,160
