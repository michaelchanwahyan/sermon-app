1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
 Well, hello, hello, hello.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,760
 So I hope you get to meet someone new.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,800
 I hope that you are sitting around someone that you don't often see and then we can get

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,180
 to know each other and be connected.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,440
 And actually, next week, there's an event going on that can get you connected as well.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,000
 And that is our Bring Your Own Lunch.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,640
 It is our monthly event where we get together and we, after the service, we all come with

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,240
 our lunches and go buy some food and come back up here.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,920
 And it's a time for you to get connected with each other.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,760
 So next week, Bring Your Own Lunch.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,960
 And also today, don't forget, after service today, we are going to have our Feast of Common.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,880
 So if you like, please stay behind, enjoy the game and the songs and the fellowship

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,860
 and to get to know someone new as well.

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,120
 And actually talking about connection, talking about community, there's one particular community

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,840
 that is always in my heart and that is the parents, especially September.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,440
 September is coming.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,520
 If you are not in the education sector or not a parent, September is just not a month

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
 for you.

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,960
 But if you're a parent or if you're stepping into primary one, September is a month that

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,880
 we all kind of, you know, have some doubts, have some, you know, tension about.

21
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,560
 And so next week, during our Bring Your Own Lunch, we are actually going to have a primary

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,000
 one prep sharing table.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,320
 And what this table is like is that I have invited a few experienced teachers to come

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,600
 and to share about what teachers or what parents should prepare and to help them to feel more

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,400
 at ease about stepping into September as a fresh primary one family.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,720
 And I've also invited, and if you, if your kid is about to step into primary one, please

27
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,400
 come to this event so that you're able to listen to, you know, experienced teachers

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,160
 talking about what are your expectations and what should you think about and what should

29
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,880
 you relax about, right?

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,640
 And if you have kids that are already along the way in primary three, four, five, six,

31
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,720
 you can also come and just share your experience.

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,000
 You know, it's, this sharing table is not about a one-way talk about, oh, this is, you

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,120
 know, what this is going to be about.

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
 You can think about this, you can think about that.

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,000
 No, sharing table is a table we created for us to have a conversation about things that

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,220
 is in our mind or in our heart.

37
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,220
 So please come.

38
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,400
 And if your kid is in like kindergarten stage and you want to know what kind of primary

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,920
 should I enroll my kids into, is all about fun, it's good for my kid, or should I give

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,640
 some, you know, academic expectation from my kid?

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,760
 What are schools like when we enroll into those schools?

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,480
 You can actually come and have a listen as well.

43
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,800
 So please scan the QR code and there's also poster over there if you want to enroll later.

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,320
 And also another very important event that is coming up is our Alpha.

45
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,080
 So last time we have our Alpha and we all have it all together, try Cantonese, the English,

46
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,520
 all in the same room and join it together.

47
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,160
 But this time we are going to have a separate day for our English Alpha.

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,760
 Okay, so if you want to join or if you want to invite someone, some of your friends to

49
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,480
 come and join Alpha, please scan for the English, English Alpha.

50
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,000
 We have our own Alpha session this time.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,760
 Isn't it exciting?

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,640
 I have often meet friends that have been in, that heard about, you know, Christianity or

53
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,800
 this or church for a long time from their school, from their friends, but they're kind

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,480
 of scared or shy to ask questions.

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,360
 This is a time for them to come, to come just to learn what this, what church is about,

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,800
 what Jesus is about.

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,120
 It's a place for them to come and enjoy a dinner and ask questions and learn about it.

58
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,360
 And there are many times when people just come to faith during these casual conversations,

59
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,760
 casual but very important life conversations.

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,880
 So please invite your friends to come.

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,360
 Please tell them to come or yourself to come along and to join Alpha as well.

62
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,880
 But if you want to serve, if you have a missional heart and you go, actually, when I go and

63
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,880
 talk to people, I'm often very shy about, you know, evangelize or things like that.

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,440
 But in this Alpha course, when you serve, you can listen to what people, what people

65
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,760
 thoughts and questions are, and you can facilitate a conversation.

66
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,080
 And there are actually many other different roles in serving Alpha as well.

67
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,080
 So if you want to serve this time, if you experience it, or even if you have not experienced

68
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,320
 Alpha but you know you want to serve, come scan this code and be a volunteer.

69
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,520
 We have a training for you.

70
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,680
 So don't worry if you don't know what it is all about.

71
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,480
 There will be training.

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
 All right.

73
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:10,080
 And so it comes to our, we're going to step into our part of worship, which is our offering

74
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,880
 and our volunteers are going to pass around the bucket for the offering.

75
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,960
 Offering is a part of our worship because we realize that everything that we have is

76
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,240
 from God.

77
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,080
 And we just want to reflect that with the resources that we have given us.

78
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,960
 So in the Bible first that it says, each of you should give what you have decided in your

79
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,200
 heart to give.

80
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,120
 You don't need to be worried or you don't have to give, but it is a reflection of what

81
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,200
 God has put into your heart.

82
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,840
 So as the bucket pass around, take the time to think about God's grace for you.

83
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,840
 Think about your connection with God.

84
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,280
 And so as we're doing that, let us pray for our offering.

85
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:05,200
 Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you that you are a God and you sustain us, sustain us with

86
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,640
 financial income, but also you are sustaining us through all the other different ways as

87
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,120
 well with family, with relationship, with a roof over our head or with many other things

88
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,480
 that you've given us.

89
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,760
 And so we want to give to you as part of our worship, knowing that you are the one who

90
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,280
 sustain us, knowing that you are gracious and generous towards us.

91
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,840
 And we just want to give thanks through our offering.

92
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,200
 And in Jesus name we pray, Amen.

93
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,380
 And so today we have our Pastor Tim sharing with us an important word with us today.

94
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:44,720
 So let's all stretch our hands towards Pastor Tim.

95
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,200
 I know that there is a word in his mind about worship, about today's sermon that is going

96
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,720
 to change our perspective and our understanding and our hearts about who God is.

97
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,440
 And so Father, we pray for anointing in Tim.

98
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,960
 May the word that you have given him, may the sermon, the wisdom that you have given

99
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:15,120
 him through his life and through his word is going to bless and change and help us to

100
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,600
 focus on you.

101
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,400
 And so we thank you God for your anointing in Tim and may we open up our hearts and ears

102
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,840
 to listen to what you have got to say to us.

103
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,280
 And in Jesus name we pray, Amen.

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
 Thank you June.

105
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,160
 Well it's great to be back.

106
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,120
 It's been a month since I've stood here, so it's good to be back.

107
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:43,400
 When I was in my early twenties, I started a practice of journaling.

108
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,320
 So I'm just curious, does anyone here else journal or am I the only one?

109
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,880
 Okay, we have some people.

110
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,960
 Good, so a few.

111
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,240
 And as I was home this summer in Germany, I saw some of those old journals and I was

112
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
 like, "Ooh, this is interesting.

113
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
 I want to read."

114
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,600
 And especially about those periods of time where a lot of important things happened.

115
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,720
 So I was like opening my journal, I was reading.

116
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:16,040
 Some of it is written like okay, but the thing that really struck me and that really stood

117
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:24,840
 out was just my expression of worship to God as I was reading.

118
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:33,240
 There was this deep desire and longing to praise God, to give him glory and to honor

119
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,120
 him.

120
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,400
 And so that made me think about different seasons of worshiping, of praising God in

121
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,720
 our lives, in my own life.

122
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:52,560
 So I've had seasons where praise flows easily, maybe life is going good, I have a lot of

123
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,640
 support around me and everything, and I'm praising God.

124
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,400
 My faith is vibrant and it's awesome and it's amazing.

125
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,440
 But then there's also other times where maybe praising God through our songs, but also through

126
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,220
 our lives is a lot harder, where it's not easy.

127
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,440
 This can be for many reasons.

128
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,060
 It can be maybe we get busy with stuff in our lives, maybe there's other things that

129
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:23,720
 take on importance that we focus on, and so Jesus moves to the side, to the periphery.

130
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,520
 Maybe we're going through something difficult, like where it's just hard for us to have joy

131
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:36,880
 and we're just overwhelmed, and so it's just hard to worship and to praise God and to seek

132
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,120
 to honor him and to give him glory.

133
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:48,520
 And so I was wondering for you, what season are you in right now?

134
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,120
 What is your worship season right now?

135
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,260
 Is it one where you're praising God, where Jesus is at the center, and where all of life

136
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:03,520
 and all that you do, you want to serve God, you want to love God?

137
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,280
 Or has Jesus moved to the periphery, and for whatever reason, other things have taken over

138
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:16,760
 and have occupied your heart, your mind, your imagination, your time, your energy?

139
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
 Where are you?

140
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,080
 So I want to explore with you through this message a question, that is how is God inviting

141
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:32,360
 you to renew, strengthen, and deepen your personal worship of God?

142
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,400
 How is he inviting you?

143
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,360
 And so I hope that today through the message, you hear God, you hear from God, and he meets

144
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
 you.

145
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,480
 Today, we're continuing in our sermon series, "Bringing Glory."

146
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,760
 Now we started that last week.

147
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,720
 Pastor Chapman kicked off the series, and part of the reason why as a church, why we

148
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,960
 came up with this four-week sermon series, we're already almost halfway through after

149
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:09,920
 today, was because there was a sense that God wants to take us deeper in our worship,

150
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,520
 in our adoration, in our praise of him.

151
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,000
 That he wants to do something new among us, something fresh.

152
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,720
 And my personal sense was even that this is not just for the sermon series, but actually

153
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,120
 for the remainder of the year.

154
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,120
 God just wants to do something new there.

155
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,320
 So I'm excited about that.

156
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,440
 I don't know how that will express itself or what that will look like, but I'm excited

157
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,320
 about what God wants to do, and so looking forward to that.

158
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,240
 Now since we talk a lot about worship, I also thought maybe it's good to give a definition

159
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,480
 of what worship is.

160
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,000
 I was struggling with that a little bit because there's so many definitions, and some are

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,720
 like super long, so I decided to just choose a very simple one, so here it is.

162
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,680
 It's from John Pipe, he says, "True worship is valuing or treasuring of God above all

163
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,400
 things."

164
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,400
 True worship is valuing or treasuring of God above all things.

165
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,680
 So that means that all of our lives, this worship of God is expressed that we treasure

166
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,000
 Him, that we value Him, that we care about who He is and what He desires from us, that

167
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,480
 we seek to bring Him praise and glory.

168
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,320
 And that's in all spheres of life, what we do when we work, how we act in our families,

169
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,240
 but yes also how we sing, how we care for the city, all of those parts.

170
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:45,000
 And you can see what you're worshiping by seeing what captures the imagination, what

171
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,760
 are you spending time on, what are you spending money on, what are you spending most of your

172
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,920
 efforts on.

173
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,840
 And is God part of that?

174
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,120
 And so true worship is valuing or treasuring of God above all things.

175
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,840
 So this is where God wants to lead us deeper into.

176
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,720
 Now one of the main places that we learn about worship is the book of Psalms.

177
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,680
 Now I love the book of Psalms.

178
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,280
 It's the worship and praise book of the Bible.

179
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:21,440
 And it has all sorts of different songs and poems in it for different seasons of the soul.

180
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,600
 So some, in January we looked at lament, actually shows that complaining is part of our spirituality.

181
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:37,400
 We can complain to God and that that is actually an act of faith and that is an act of worship.

182
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,520
 But today we're looking at a different type of Psalm.

183
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,160
 We're going to be in Psalm 96 and I just want to set the context before I'll read it to

184
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,440
 you.

185
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:53,520
 So Psalm 96, the context is Israel has just returned from exile.

186
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:00,360
 So they were in Babylon for 70 years and they just got back and it was this incredible saving

187
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,360
 work of God that he did.

188
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,560
 And so people were excited.

189
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,760
 It was amazing and God was very real for people at that time.

190
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,080
 So let's, let me take you to Psalm 96 and starting in verse one it says this, "Sing

191
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,800
 to the Lord a new song.

192
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,360
 Sing to the Lord all the earth.

193
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
 Sing to the Lord.

194
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,960
 Praise his name.

195
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,040
 Proclaim his salvation day after day.

196
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,560
 Declare his glory among the nations.

197
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,960
 His marvelous deeds among all peoples.

198
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,520
 For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.

199
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,440
 He is to be feared above all gods.

200
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,440
 For all the gods of the nations are idols but the Lord made the heavens.

201
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,280
 Splendor and majesty are before him.

202
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,000
 Strength and glory are in the sanctuary.

203
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,640
 Ascribe to the Lord all you families of nations.

204
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,560
 Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.

205
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,160
 Ascribe to the Lord glory due to his name.

206
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,480
 Bring an offering.

207
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
 Come into his courts.

208
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,480
 Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.

209
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,060
 Tremble before him all the earth.

210
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,680
 Stay among the nations.

211
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,160
 The Lord reigns.

212
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,120
 The world is firmly established.

213
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,760
 It cannot be moved.

214
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,120
 He will judge the peoples with equity.

215
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,080
 Let the heavens rejoice.

216
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,720
 Let the earth be glad.

217
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,760
 Let the sea resound and all that is in it.

218
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,260
 Let the fields be jubilant and everything in them.

219
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,320
 Let all the trees of the forest sing for joy.

220
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,280
 Let all creation rejoice before the Lord for he comes.

221
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,040
 He comes to judge the earth.

222
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,080
 He will judge the world in righteousness and the people in his faithfulness.

223
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:06,280
 So let's see how God might be inviting you through his psalm to renew, to strengthen,

224
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,880
 to deepen your worship of him.

225
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,080
 Now I want to break down a little bit how the psalm works.

226
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,520
 So in the psalm there's three movements of the same thing.

227
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,160
 There's a call to worship and then there's a reason for why we worship God, a call to

228
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,640
 worship, a reason for why we worship God, and a call to worship and a reason for why

229
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,780
 we worship God.

230
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:33,040
 And so the first call is to sing and then we're told because God is great.

231
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:41,120
 Then there is the call to scribe to the Lord and then the reason is because he reigns.

232
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
 He governs all.

233
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,680
 We sang earlier he is above all.

234
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,960
 I can remember all position, powers, dominions, whatever.

235
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,480
 Thank you June.

236
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,080
 And then the final movement is like there's this call to rejoice to all creation and then

237
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:04,400
 it says the reason for why we worship him is because he comes, he comes, that God comes

238
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,340
 to his people, he meets his people and to restore justice.

239
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,880
 So that's the movement of the psalm and it gets more intense as you go.

240
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,680
 It's intensifying.

241
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:20,040
 Now I want us to start off by looking at the first reason for why we worship God.

242
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,480
 And so that we find in verse four and says this, "For great is the Lord and most worthy

243
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,760
 of praise."

244
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,600
 So we praise God because he is great.

245
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,880
 Now our praise is not empty.

246
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
 It's not shallow.

247
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
 It has substance.

248
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,200
 It has a reason.

249
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,380
 It's based on experience.

250
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,040
 It's based on truth.

251
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:48,120
 So in Israel's case right now, what just had happened was absolutely incredible.

252
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:57,160
 They were for 70 years in exile, 70 years living in captivity and God freed them, brought

253
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,880
 them back to their homeland after 70 years.

254
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,720
 So that they could settle there again, rebuild Jerusalem, rebuild the temple.

255
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,200
 I mean, this was an amazing act of power.

256
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,520
 But it was not just God's power.

257
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,040
 It was also God prophesied, his prophets prophesied that he will do that in 70 years.

258
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,160
 So God is faithful to his word.

259
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,040
 So God is great because he's faithful.

260
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,080
 God does what he says.

261
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,440
 But not only that, there's more.

262
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,180
 God also showed mercy.

263
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,960
 Because the reason why Israel was in exile was because he had sinned over and over and

264
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,600
 over again.

265
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,040
 But now God was showing his grace and mercy and was bringing them back.

266
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:53,880
 And so Israel, the community of faith, God's people worship God because he is great.

267
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,800
 So it's rooted in what God has done.

268
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,300
 It's not just something that somebody says about someone.

269
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,840
 It's because of who he is.

270
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,120
 So God is most worthy of praise.

271
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:18,320
 Now what's interesting is our worship, worship is always revelation and then response.

272
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,820
 So what that means is we worship God because God in some way, in some form has himself

273
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,400
 made known to us.

274
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,480
 He has revealed himself to us.

275
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,860
 So in Israel's case it was this amazing redemption of bringing them back.

276
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,980
 For us, maybe it's what Jesus has done when we experience him coming into our lives and

277
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:41,200
 giving us peace and maybe doing some healing work in us.

278
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,680
 And so because of that, we cannot help because God has made himself known.

279
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,240
 He has revealed himself.

280
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,680
 We cannot help but to praise him.

281
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:56,320
 That's the only response that makes sense.

282
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,640
 But to move into praise, there always needs to be revelation of God showing his love,

283
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,800
 his care, his mercy, his power to his people in their lives.

284
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,280
 And then because of that, we fall on our knees and we say, we worship you, Lord.

285
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
 We love you.

286
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,520
 We praise you.

287
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,520
 We adore you because of God working in this way.

288
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:25,540
 Now when I was studying to be a pastor, I was going through a difficult season.

289
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,240
 I just lost joy in my life.

290
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,680
 I don't know if any of you can relate to that where joy suddenly just seems to have left

291
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
 the building.

292
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,200
 It's not Elvis, it was joy who left.

293
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,300
 And I was just really struggling.

294
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,160
 And one thing, looking back on that time, I wasn't praising God much.

295
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,440
 My praise was very little.

296
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,960
 Here I'm studying to be a pastor, my praise was very little.

297
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,760
 And I had an assignment in one of the classes which was to write down my spiritual journey,

298
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,240
 all the ways that God worked, all these turning points and difficulties, and just kind of

299
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
 map that out.

300
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:10,760
 So as I was doing that, I just started being overwhelmed by the mercy, by the goodness,

301
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,920
 by the faithfulness of God as I was looking at my life.

302
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,520
 I was remembering how Jesus freed me from spiritual oppression, where I had anxiety,

303
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,320
 I had fear, I had no peace.

304
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,200
 And Jesus gave me peace.

305
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,960
 I could finally rest.

306
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:34,200
 Then God in his sovereignty brought me from Germany where I was struggling.

307
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,280
 I was not a good student in Germany, I struggled with the school system.

308
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,940
 It's a little bit like Hong Kong, or at least used to be, where there's not much encouragement

309
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,280
 from teachers about your schooling and things.

310
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,560
 And so I just was not doing that well.

311
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,680
 But then because of basketball I went to the US, but later on looking back I saw that God

312
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:00,160
 brought me there, because there I met people my age who loved Jesus, who desired to serve

313
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
 him and follow him.

314
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,320
 I didn't have friends like that in Germany.

315
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,000
 So suddenly I was in this different, God brought me in this different context.

316
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,560
 I was doing good works in my life.

317
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,600
 Then God called me in just the right timing out of a job in finance.

318
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,800
 I was just about to invest a lot of money for somebody I knew.

319
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,400
 And if that would have gone through, I would have been stuck with it.

320
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,560
 God called me out into a different career path.

321
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:33,200
 And then I had this incredible experience of serving with YWAM, actually we have some

322
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,760
 YWAM people here, and God confirmed this call in my life.

323
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,120
 And then I felt like, well I probably should go to seminary or something and study so I'm

324
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:48,680
 qualified to somehow serve God as being a pastor, a missionary, or something.

325
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,880
 But I didn't have any money.

326
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,360
 And then I remember that God provided for me.

327
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,300
 I got a full scholarship to seminary.

328
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,160
 Now if you have ever dealt with seminary, that usually doesn't happen.

329
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,040
 Not only that, God provided for me work as a chaplain at the university for two years.

330
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,040
 So my housing was paid, my food was paid, my internet was paid, my electricity bill,

331
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,400
 everything was paid and I got a stipend on top of it.

332
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
 Wow!

333
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,680
 So I was sitting there in my room and recounting what God did.

334
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,880
 Tears started filling my eyes.

335
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,880
 And I said, "Lord, you are so good.

336
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,840
 You are so faithful."

337
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
 And I started worshipping him.

338
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,000
 Because he showed me, he revealed to me his goodness again.

339
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,720
 And God doesn't just work in the past, but he always does fresh and new things in our

340
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
 lives.

341
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,840
 And there is always new reasons to praise God.

342
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,040
 But we'll get to that in a little bit.

343
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,880
 So if you have the desire to renew and strengthen your worship, one of the things you can do

344
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,280
 is actually look back on your life.

345
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,400
 You know, what has God done?

346
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:58,000
 And take time, maybe map out your spiritual journey and just allow God to speak.

347
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,520
 You ask God to reveal himself to you.

348
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,440
 Like in a prayer, "God, reveal yourself to me.

349
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,000
 Show me how you work.

350
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,480
 I'm not seeing you right now.

351
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,400
 I'm not feeling you right now.

352
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,400
 You know, show, reveal yourself to me."

353
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,480
 And then as God does that, you know, he moves us to worshipping and praising him.

354
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,680
 Because we can see his goodness.

355
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,720
 We can see who he is.

356
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,160
 That's incredible.

357
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,360
 Now let's go to the part where there's a call.

358
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,680
 So I said there's a call to worship and then there's a reason.

359
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,920
 So let's go back to verse 1 through 3, where it says, "Sing to the Lord."

360
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,000
 It says that three times, "Sing to the Lord, sing to the Lord, sing to the Lord."

361
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Three times.

362
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,560
 Like, what's up with that?

363
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:51,120
 Now singing, if you think about singing, it's actually something quite vulnerable.

364
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,720
 I'd be a little bit scared if I needed to start singing here right now.

365
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
 I might do it.

366
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,440
 No, I'm just kidding.

367
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,800
 Everybody gets scared.

368
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,880
 It depends on the song.

369
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,720
 There might be a song I'm comfortable singing.

370
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,480
 But if you think about it, when we sing, we're really expressing things from our hearts.

371
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,400
 And the classical thing would be the love song.

372
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,880
 A boy or girl wants to express their love for their beloved.

373
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,440
 And maybe they write a song and then at night, in the whole big building complex, they're

374
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,280
 downstairs with an amp and they're playing the guitar and start singing to their love

375
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,360
 and everybody's annoyed except for the person he's singing to or she is singing to.

376
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,920
 And there's something about words and music that somehow express things differently than

377
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,040
 if it's just words.

378
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,400
 And I find it interesting that God desires his people to sing.

379
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:55,320
 Not every religion has really singing as a focal point in their practices and their spirituality.

380
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:02,200
 And on one occasion, I wrote a song, the only song I've ever written, and it was a song

381
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,100
 for my father.

382
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,960
 My father in 2006 was diagnosed with cancer.

383
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:17,320
 And Christmas was coming up and we knew that this would probably be his last Christmas

384
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,840
 unless God does a miracle.

385
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,520
 Now, Christmas was always special and we all, as a whole family, got together.

386
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,440
 We were living all over the world as a family.

387
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,520
 And so I worked with a youth.

388
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,200
 I was in Germany at the time working in a youth group.

389
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,680
 One of my youth, he was a rapper.

390
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,560
 He actually had a contract with a label.

391
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,560
 So he helped me build a beat on Fruity Loops, whatever that is.

392
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,960
 And so it's an R&B song.

393
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,240
 And so I wrote some lyrics to express to my father what he meant to me.

394
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,640
 Now the lyrics are not particularly good, but they were the right lyrics for that moment.

395
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:07,920
 So I want to share some with you.

396
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,980
 Okay I'll sing the chorus, but I will not sing the other part.

397
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,400
 So it says, "The first memory of you and me playing.

398
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,320
 It was me behind the door daily waiting.

399
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,280
 I wanted to scare you every time when you came home.

400
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,640
 Never feeling alone.

401
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,120
 I feel safe and secure knowing you love me whatever I do.

402
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,120
 You made me into the man that I am today.

403
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,840
 You told me all about Jesus the Lord and Savior that changed my life and taught me the right

404
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,320
 behavior.

405
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,200
 You gave me so much more, more than I needed.

406
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,680
 Now it's time for me to give it back.

407
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
 Hope you feel it."

408
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,840
 And then, I don't know if I can sing it now.

409
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,000
 Thank you, thank you dad for being.

410
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,720
 You were not perfect, but the perfect one for me.

411
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,760
 Thank you always believing, always seeing the good side of me.

412
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
 Thank you.

413
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:11,480
 And so it goes on.

414
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,680
 Now I was not going to do that.

415
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,880
 You guys made me do it.

416
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,400
 How dare you?

417
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:26,680
 But you know, as we were sitting there and I was singing the recording, I played the

418
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,800
 CD, my whole family was tearing up.

419
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,880
 Because the words plus the music, they just gave expression.

420
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,120
 I was able to narrate back to my father who he was.

421
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,320
 He was the one who pretended like he's scared every time he walks through the door because

422
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,560
 I scared him as a little kid.

423
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,800
 He was the one who made me feel safe and secure that I knew it didn't matter what I did, he

424
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
 loved me.

425
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,560
 He was the one who told me about Jesus.

426
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,840
 So I'm just telling him and expressing my thanks.

427
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,800
 You know, in this instance, just words would have not done it.

428
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
 It needed a song.

429
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:10,320
 But now when we think of God, how much more has God done in our lives?

430
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,660
 And through song, we can also narrate back to God who he is.

431
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:21,120
 And we can bring expression with our whole being, not just our intellect, but with our

432
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,560
 emotions and feelings and all of that, we can express our worship, our praise, our gratitude

433
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,200
 to God.

434
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,600
 So our singing to the Lord offers us a way to give expression to our feelings, emotions,

435
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:45,680
 and mood where we can say to God what we cannot simply say through words alone.

436
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,120
 So the psalmist calls us to sing to the Lord, you know, to come before him with all that

437
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,040
 we have and to give him praise.

438
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,440
 And in some way, it's also the giving of all of ourselves, you know, because we're not

439
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,680
 just giving him our intellect, but we're giving him everything, all of us, you know, in our

440
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,320
 worship and praise.

441
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,200
 So God calls us to sing, and that's why we sing.

442
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,080
 That's why we sing on Sundays.

443
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,160
 And we express with our emotions and feelings, you know, to God how much we love him and

444
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
 who he is.

445
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,880
 But there's a second part I want to get to.

446
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
 What do we sing about?

447
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,440
 You know, what's the content?

448
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,640
 Actually verse two and three also give us a little detail on that.

449
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,360
 So in verse two, it says, "Sing to the Lord, praise his name, proclaim his salvation day

450
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:35,440
 after day, declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deed among all peoples."

451
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,520
 So to praise the name means to enhance someone's reputation.

452
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,680
 It's like if I say, "June, she's incredible.

453
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,080
 Do you know what an amazing teacher she is in K4C?"

454
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,560
 Like, wow.

455
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,200
 And if I would say that and she's not a teacher or she's not a good teacher, then it wouldn't

456
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,560
 be really meaningful.

457
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,680
 But because she really is a good teacher, you know, so my praise has meaning.

458
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
 It has substance.

459
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,280
 It means something.

460
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:11,080
 And so when we praise the name of God, when we praise his name, we're enhancing his reputation.

461
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,640
 We're saying how incredible, how amazing God is.

462
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,880
 And there's two ways here that we do it.

463
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:24,200
 First, we proclaim his salvation day after day.

464
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
 So we tell of him.

465
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,240
 For Israel, this would have meant to talk about the Exodus, the first one and also the

466
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,920
 second one, and his amazing saving work and the history of the people of God.

467
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,160
 You know, for us, of course, it has to do with Jesus.

468
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,520
 We're talking about Jesus and what he has done and how he has saved us, how he has forgiven

469
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,760
 us, how he's given us a new life, how he's transforming us, how he's working things out

470
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,160
 for the good and leads us into purposes.

471
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,400
 And we're just, you know, proclaiming that.

472
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,240
 It's his saving work as we're singing.

473
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,920
 And again, it's based on real things, you know, and we're enhancing his reputation.

474
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,680
 And then secondly, it says, it talks about declaring God's glory.

475
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,160
 Now, what in the world does that mean?

476
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,520
 So to declare God's glory means to speak of wonders, his work as creator.

477
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,400
 It means to speak of God as king.

478
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
 He is sovereign.

479
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,600
 He is ruler.

480
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,440
 Of course, God is savior.

481
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,260
 Now what's interesting that the Hebrew word for glory that's used here, "kabod," is related

482
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,880
 to glorify, to verb, "kavad," which really means to be heavy.

483
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,280
 Actually, it's also used to talk about being fat.

484
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,280
 Interesting, right?

485
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,920
 You're like, "Glory and being fat?

486
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,200
 Like how does that fit together?"

487
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:51,200
 Well, what it's about is about that the one we're giving glory to because he has weight.

488
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
 He's weighty.

489
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,400
 He has importance.

490
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,840
 He doesn't lack substance.

491
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,680
 He's not easily just blown away.

492
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,760
 And so this is part of the concept of glory.

493
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:06,600
 So to declare God's glory means to declare God's substance, his weightiness, his significance

494
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:15,840
 among all people because he is the only one, you know, who has this glory to this level.

495
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:24,280
 He's the most weighty, the most important, the most worthy God.

496
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:32,240
 And so in our singing, we proclaim and we declare God's glory because he has substance.

497
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,480
 He has, as I was sharing with this example with June, he is the creator.

498
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
 He is the savior.

499
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,120
 He has the power to do that.

500
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,560
 Nobody else can do that.

501
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,000
 There's nobody else who deserves this kind of praise or glory.

502
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,120
 So we praise God in this way.

503
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,840
 We declare him glory.

504
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,480
 Now, the psalmist also says, "Sing to the Lord a new song."

505
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,440
 Now what's with this new song?

506
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,360
 What does that all, you know, what does that mean?

507
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:06,480
 Well, there's a need for a new song because God has done something new.

508
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
 And so that's why we need to sing a new song.

509
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
 We need to bring God praise.

510
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,640
 Again, that's that revelation.

511
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,120
 God has done something new.

512
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,040
 And then now we praise him.

513
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,320
 And again, the appropriate response is to even write a new song, to give him praise,

514
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,680
 to sing it out to him.

515
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:31,680
 And it's, you know, it's amazing because a lot of times when these new songs arrive,

516
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:36,120
 it's actually in a season when stuff has been very difficult and heavy.

517
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,600
 That we needed deliverance, that we needed his help, that we needed his mercy, that we

518
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,560
 needed his grace, that we needed him to act in our lives, you know, so that something

519
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,880
 changes.

520
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,160
 And then he does.

521
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,880
 And then there's a reason to sing him a new song.

522
00:34:53,880 --> 00:35:00,200
 So we worship God with the new songs because God always, is always doing new and good things

523
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
 in our lives.

524
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:09,240
 He's always doing new and good things in our lives.

525
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:17,400
 So one of the practices that I do is once a week, sometimes every two weeks or so, I

526
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,400
 do try to write down how God has been good.

527
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,000
 And one time I read a challenge that was like, don't just write like five things or 10 things,

528
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,560
 because that's, you know, you'll write the same things.

529
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
 Thanks God that I'm breathing.

530
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,580
 You know, thank God that I'm...

531
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,580
 Write down 30.

532
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:42,760
 You know, 30 ways of how God has been good to you in this past week.

533
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,880
 And it's incredible when I do that, there's so many things that I forgot about or didn't

534
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
 notice.

535
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,840
 You know, and again, it's a way to renew our worship of him, to strengthen our worship

536
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,400
 because we see that he does new things every day.

537
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,760
 And there's a couple of verses I want to share with you from Limitations 22 and 23, and it

538
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
 says this.

539
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,520
 "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.

540
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,520
 His mercies never come to an end.

541
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,540
 They are new every morning.

542
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,420
 Great is your faithfulness."

543
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,280
 New mercies every morning.

544
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:24,760
 Every day God is doing something and showing us, is being good to us in new and fresh ways.

545
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:31,960
 We always have reason for new praise, for new worship, because God is good every day,

546
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,120
 doing new things, showing you his love, guiding you, showing you his care, providing for you,

547
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,760
 whatever it may be.

548
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,400
 And so he deserves our praise.

549
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,920
 Now let me highlight to you a theme that actually runs through most of the song.

550
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:56,240
 In verse 3, it says, "Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all

551
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,240
 peoples."

552
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,600
 So our praise is not just meant to be sung here on a Sunday morning, but it's actually

553
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,680
 meant to be sung among all the nations, among all peoples.

554
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,880
 We're supposed to proclaim of his salvation, you know, declare his glory and his goodness.

555
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,880
 And I was like, "How do you do that?

556
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
 You know, what does that look like?"

557
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,120
 It's like, do you, like when you're at work, do you like start singing?

558
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,560
 Like, you know, in the middle of the meeting, you stand up and like, what does it look like?

559
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,840
 Of course we can talk about that, but the Olympics actually gave me an example.

560
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:35,800
 So I want to share with you a photo of Yemisi.

561
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,080
 So this is a German gold medalist in the shot put.

562
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,640
 And it was really surprising.

563
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,080
 Nobody was expecting it.

564
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,080
 And she ended up winning.

565
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:52,280
 So in one of her interviews in English, she actually praised God through song.

566
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,800
 And she's a gospel singer, so it was good.

567
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,920
 And then on German television, they asked her if she can sing more because they liked

568
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
 it.

569
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,300
 And so she got the whole like technical crew like clapping, and she was praising God and

570
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,240
 proclaiming his goodness.

571
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,840
 You know, in German, on the public TV station, it has the rights for the Olympics.

572
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,920
 You know, amazing.

573
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,440
 And then now it's making its rounds on social media.

574
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:27,200
 So she is proclaiming, you know, salvation and declaring God's glory among the nations,

575
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,960
 among all people.

576
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,320
 Amazing, incredible, and so sympathetic.

577
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,920
 You know, such a, you should look her up and then watch some of these, it's awesome.

578
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:48,080
 Now when we do that, it's actually meant to raise questions in other people's lives.

579
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,800
 What am I worshipping?

580
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,400
 Why is this person singing like this and talking about this stuff?

581
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,240
 Should I think about this?

582
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,800
 Do I need to consider that?

583
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,280
 And so then in verse four and five, it goes on, it says, "For great is the Lord, and most

584
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
 worthy of praise.

585
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,400
 He is to be feared above all gods, for all gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord

586
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,760
 made the heavens."

587
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,160
 So Israel singing proclaims the greatness, the power of God, his salvation, his ability

588
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,320
 to rescue, to change lives.

589
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,040
 And they're singing it not just when they gather, but they're singing it so that it's

590
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,480
 overheard.

591
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:38,440
 Our worship needs to overflow so that other people hear it.

592
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,440
 And then it's meant to make people think about what they worship.

593
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,400
 And here it talks about the idols, and that the idols are, what does it say?

594
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,600
 For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.

595
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,040
 These other so-called gods and things that we're worshipping, they don't measure up.

596
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,200
 They're not worth our worship and our praise.

597
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,680
 They're not worth dedicating our lives to.

598
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,440
 Now for us, today, of course, that can also mean literally idols, but it can also mean

599
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:16,240
 like worshipping success, or worshipping pleasure, or whatever it is.

600
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,420
 And it doesn't measure up compared to God.

601
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:24,840
 And so our worship is meant to raise this question among other people, what am I worshipping,

602
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,320
 and is it really worth it?

603
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,920
 And of course, it's also an invitation for the nations and for all God's people to worship

604
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,360
 God and to experience him, to know him, that he's the one that's powerful, and he's the

605
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,160
 one that can change our circumstances, who can transform our lives.

606
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,880
 And so there's actually this call to worship to the nations is in the next part, verse

607
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
 7 through 10.

608
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,720
 "Ascribe to the Lord all your families and nations.

609
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,600
 Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.

610
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,920
 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due to his name.

611
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,960
 Bring an offering and come into his courts.

612
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,000
 Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.

613
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,400
 Tremble before him, all the earth.

614
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,200
 Say among the nations, 'The Lord reigns.'"

615
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,560
 So this call to the nations to give to the Lord, or ascribe to the Lord and worship for

616
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,840
 him, actually would have been shocking to Israel.

617
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,380
 Because if you think about it, they just came out of captivity.

618
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:26,040
 And now God is inviting all the people to come and worship, to come into the temple.

619
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,240
 That's what this picture, what the psalm is picturing.

620
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:35,000
 It's inviting foreigners to come into the temple and to worship like Israel worships.

621
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,680
 And the reason for that is God's heart for all people.

622
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,720
 Because he desires for all to know him, to experience his goodness and to worship him.

623
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,280
 And so we worship God because God's heart is for all peoples, from all nations to worship

624
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,720
 him and to experience his salvation and goodness in their lives.

625
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:01,720
 And that should also actually move us to worship and renew and strengthen our worship.

626
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,080
 God wants to touch other people's lives.

627
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,120
 He wants to bring other people in to worship him.

628
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,080
 He doesn't want the worship just to be contained here.

629
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:16,840
 He wants it to flow over into Yuen Long and into the city of Hong Kong and beyond.

630
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,120
 Because he wants other people to know him, to know his goodness and to worship and to

631
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,880
 praise him.

632
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,880
 And so God can reveal us his heart and that can lead us to praise him.

633
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,480
 God is not just a God for some people, he's God for all people.

634
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:39,680
 And that leads us into praising and worshiping him.

635
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,360
 And then the final reason that I want to look at with you for praising and worshiping God

636
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,400
 and how we can also renew our worship is given in verse 13.

637
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,680
 It says this, "Let all creation rejoice before the Lord, for he comes, he comes to judge

638
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,680
 the earth.

639
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,080
 He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his faithfulness."

640
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:10,240
 Now, the thing about God is that he has come in history over and over again to meet his

641
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,880
 people, to deliver them, to provide for them.

642
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,120
 And of course, he has come through Jesus, which the psalm is also looking ahead to,

643
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:28,000
 to inaugurate the kingdom of God, to bring his salvation, his redemption to people.

644
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,240
 But from the New Testament, we also know that Jesus is coming again to judge and to rule

645
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,360
 the earth.

646
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,560
 And it's interesting because that's a reason for rejoicing.

647
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,920
 Like usually, when we think of judgment, we don't think of it as something good.

648
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,080
 But I think with God is he's a righteous judge.

649
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,640
 He judges fairly.

650
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,760
 He judges correctly.

651
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:57,080
 And for those of us who know God, we can stand in Jesus' righteousness before him.

652
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:03,600
 And we can stand and we can enjoy his new creation where he makes all things whole,

653
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,720
 where he sets all things right, where he brings about complete justice, where his work of

654
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,600
 redemption is completed.

655
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,080
 And so that's another reason why we worship God.

656
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:20,160
 We look ahead into the future, praise Jesus because he comes again to set everything right

657
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,640
 and to treat everyone fair.

658
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,000
 Because that's the God that we serve, who has the power to do it, to complete his work

659
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,460
 that he's begun, to wipe away every tear, to bring complete wholeness where there has

660
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:45,480
 been brokenness in our lives and this world has been destroyed and impacted by sin.

661
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:51,640
 So I want to invite the worship team to come up.

662
00:44:51,640 --> 00:45:01,520
 And I actually want to invite right now all of us to take some time to prayerfully reflect.

663
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:08,220
 Because at the beginning I asked the question, how can we renew, strengthen, deepen our worship

664
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,440
 of God?

665
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,100
 And I asked, where are you on this journey?

666
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,780
 What is your worship looking like?

667
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:22,120
 And so I just want to give this time right now to connect with God, for him to reveal

668
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:29,040
 himself to you, to speak to you about who he is, what he has done.

669
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:36,360
 And I want to especially encourage also those of us who maybe it's been right now tough

670
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:43,480
 and you're struggling, because we serve a God who comes again and again and again to

671
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:54,100
 meet his people, to powerfully work in their lives, to bring hope that change circumstances,

672
00:45:54,100 --> 00:46:01,100
 to bring healing, to give strength and grace for whatever it is that we're facing.

673
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:13,240
 And so we worship a God who is always working, whose mercies in our lives are new every morning.

674
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:20,280
 So just want to open up this time to just talk with God, pray, and then in a little

675
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,560
 while all pray for us and then we'll sing to the Lord.
