1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 Jesus, we thank you for Tim, Lord.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,300
 We thank you that you are speaking to him

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,600
 and you are also speaking through him, Jesus.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,380
 Lord, we thank you for the scripture

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,700
 that you have breathed into words, Lord,

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,600
 that's words that Tim can just take upon himself

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,520
 and that you are strengthening him to speak

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,580
 those same words out towards us, Jesus.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,920
 So Lord, we pray that your words may just

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,440
 fill his mouth today and so that they may

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,440
 fill our spirits, Jesus.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,440
 Lord, I pray that just whatever he has prepared today, Lord,

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,920
 they will just ring true in our hearts, Jesus.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,400
 That it is by your grace and by your name

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,400
 that these things can come true into our lives, Jesus, Lord.

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,080
 So we thank you for Tim, we bless him out of this message.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,640
 Praise in your name, Jesus.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,720
 Amen. - Amen, amen.

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,200
 Thank you, Benedict.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,760
 Hey, today is Benedict's first time service leading,

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,200
 so let's give him a big hand.

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,080
 (audience applauding)

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,680
 Well done, thank you so much.

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,600
 My first year in university,

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,560
 I was really struggling academically.

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,120
 I had just spent one year in the US

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,160
 and my English was not that good.

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,720
 And the requirements between high school

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,360
 and university quite differently.

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
 So there really was this, I was stretched

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,520
 to the limits of my ability.

32
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,800
 And there was this one moment that I remember,

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,960
 it's an iconic moment for me.

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,380
 I was in one of the study rooms by myself,

35
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,360
 reading my pre-med biology book,

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,360
 and there was a page where I didn't know 50 words

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,960
 on one page.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,520
 And that was a time when you use a physical dictionary

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,120
 to look up words.

40
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,680
 So I started looking up words,

41
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,240
 and I mean, it just takes forever.

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,120
 You even have to find the right word,

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,960
 it's different than it is today.

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,000
 And I was so discouraged.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,920
 I was like, how in the world am I supposed to

46
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,460
 even graduate from university?

47
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,160
 How is this even supposed to work?

48
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,280
 Now, that was not the only area where I was discouraged.

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,480
 The other one was, it seemed like every class

50
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,220
 had like multiple papers due.

51
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,400
 10 page papers, you know, write two of those.

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,880
 And since English already was not that easy for me,

53
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,580
 now I suddenly had to process everything in English,

54
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,760
 write everything in English.

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,000
 And I really needed help.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,600
 I needed help.

57
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,920
 And there was a guy on my freshman,

58
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,160
 back then we call it dorm,

59
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,680
 nowadays we call it residence hall,

60
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,760
 in my freshman dorm, his name was Ryan.

61
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,560
 And he was so gracious to me.

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,480
 Like, he helped me read through my papers,

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,000
 he gave me feedback on how I can improve them,

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,280
 he helped even edit things,

65
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,960
 and it really made a huge difference for me.

66
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,800
 'Cause I really was at the limits

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,640
 of what I was able to do at the time.

68
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,200
 Now fast forward, probably like 10 years

69
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,080
 or something like that, I was a pastor,

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,160
 I'm actually serving already at this time in Hong Kong

71
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,260
 at a different church.

72
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,160
 And I just had this moment where I just realized

73
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,160
 this grace and mercy that God just has poured over my life.

74
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,120
 Where he's placed people in my life

75
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,560
 that helped me along the way,

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,320
 in significant ways, like my friend Ryan,

77
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,320
 but also in other ways, and have just supported me,

78
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,600
 and allowed me to flourish,

79
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,360
 and even be at the point where I was at that time.

80
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,640
 And I was just overcome with gratitude,

81
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,960
 with just God's goodness.

82
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,640
 Wow, God, you're so good to me.

83
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,400
 You have shown me so much love,

84
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,800
 so much care, so much kindness through all these people.

85
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,360
 And I don't know if you ever have that experience

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,680
 where you're just so moved and touched by God,

87
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,180
 just for his goodness in your life.

88
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,960
 And as I was sort of just sitting in that moment,

89
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,820
 suddenly there was the Holy Spirit's nudging.

90
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,920
 Tim, it's time.

91
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,680
 It's time for you to turn around and help others.

92
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,540
 I've given you so much help,

93
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,340
 and now it's time for you to go and help those around you.

94
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,640
 Now, it wasn't that I wasn't doing anything.

95
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,840
 I mean, I was a pastor, I was involved in things.

96
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,740
 There was certain ways where I was helping people in need.

97
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,280
 But there was a gap between what I believed

98
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
 and what I actually did,

99
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,520
 between my faith and between my actions.

100
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,560
 And the Holy Spirit was nudging me,

101
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,780
 let's close that gap.

102
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,360
 Let's live more consistently with what you believe

103
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,980
 and what you're doing.

104
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,020
 And so I believe for everyone,

105
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,860
 every Christian, every Jesus follower,

106
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,900
 there is this tension.

107
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,320
 There's things we know about Jesus,

108
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,580
 we know about loving our neighbor,

109
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,540
 we know about God's mercy, we know about justice,

110
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,940
 but then there's the part of actually doing it.

111
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,780
 And so we're all on this journey of closing this gap,

112
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,980
 and we're at different points, and that's okay.

113
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,020
 You know, some of us, maybe we haven't thought much

114
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,500
 about it, others of us, maybe you've already narrowed

115
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,900
 that gap in incredible ways,

116
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,900
 and that's beautiful and wonderful.

117
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,200
 But what I wanna do today with you in this message,

118
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,500
 I wanna explore with you this question.

119
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,700
 How can I start narrowing the gap between what I believe

120
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,460
 about justice and mercy,

121
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,040
 and putting my faith more consistently into action?

122
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,000
 You know, how do I do this?

123
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,380
 And how can we take next steps on the journey?

124
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,980
 And so today we're continuing our God of Justice

125
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,940
 sermon series, we're in the fourth week.

126
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,700
 At the beginning of the sermon series,

127
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,780
 we looked at the redemptive grand narrative of Scripture.

128
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,420
 And I wanna take you to an image that I showed back then.

129
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,860
 You're welcome also to go back online and watch the sermon.

130
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,780
 So can we go to the image, please?

131
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,620
 Thank you.

132
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,900
 So we, I'll start over here.

133
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,700
 So we talked about that God created us for good.

134
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,100
 And there's this overarching story in the Bible

135
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,860
 that makes sense out of all the books,

136
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,700
 all the different individual authors,

137
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,020
 and it's one large story, and it's that redemptive story.

138
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,220
 And God created us for good.

139
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,020
 And there's four relational contexts

140
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,300
 that he created to flourish.

141
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,980
 You know, our relationship with God,

142
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,500
 our relationship with ourselves,

143
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,420
 our relationship with others, and our relationship

144
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,660
 with God, and our relationship with God.

145
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,060
 And our relationship with creation.

146
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,180
 And as God created us, all of that was flourishing

147
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,700
 and thriving, and it was good.

148
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,260
 It was really good.

149
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,660
 But then something happened, right?

150
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,340
 We talked about Adam and Eve and how sin broke

151
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,380
 into the world, and that we were damaged by evil.

152
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,940
 You know, that sin corrupted everything

153
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,260
 and impacted every aspect of our lives,

154
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,940
 and that's symbolized by these like lightning rods

155
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,940
 or squiggly lines.

156
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,220
 And you see there's like breakdown in our relationship

157
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,340
 between us and God.

158
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,340
 There's breakdown in our relationship even with ourselves.

159
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,180
 There's breakdown in our relationship with others,

160
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,940
 and there's breakdown in our relationship with creation

161
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,740
 and how we steward and relate to creation.

162
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,220
 Then we looked at Israel and God's story

163
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,420
 that he did not give up.

164
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,380
 He did not give up on his creation.

165
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,820
 He did not give up on his people.

166
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,740
 And there's just this very long story of God not giving up,

167
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,820
 of God calling Abraham, setting apart Israel,

168
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,860
 calling them to be righteous and holy and just,

169
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,540
 and they go through these cycles of like being righteous,

170
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,820
 holy, and just, and then suddenly being unjust,

171
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,980
 and God confronts them.

172
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,780
 But whatever was going on, that that cycle just continued.

173
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,580
 Then we talked about that Jesus came,

174
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,260
 that he restored us for life,

175
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,940
 that he entered into this broken world.

176
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,180
 That's why the cross goes on the inside of this world.

177
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,180
 He came into this world to break the power of sin,

178
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,820
 to make the unrighteous righteous in him

179
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,140
 through his forgiveness and give us new life.

180
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,820
 But we also said that we don't just wanna remain

181
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,420
 that our relationship with God is restored,

182
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,060
 but that God actually has a mission for us

183
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,980
 and that he has sent us together to heal.

184
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,900
 You know, we're sent out now to go and do his,

185
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,740
 be participate in his redeeming, his healing,

186
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,540
 his renewing work in these four areas

187
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,300
 where God uses us to bring wholeness,

188
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,260
 to have his will done, to connect people with God,

189
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,780
 to restore relationships, to restore relationships

190
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,500
 between people with themselves, with others,

191
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,980
 and even with creation.

192
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,300
 And so that's what we've been looking at.

193
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,580
 And so what we're focusing on today is this part

194
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,300
 about our relationship between us and others

195
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,580
 and how God is calling us to bring,

196
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,340
 be part of his renewing and restoring work

197
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,860
 that has to do with addressing physical, emotional,

198
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,140
 spiritual, relational needs,

199
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,260
 and just being available to God to make them thrive.

200
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,380
 And so we wanna look on that interpersonal level.

201
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,500
 And so we're today in the book of James.

202
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,660
 Now, the book of James,

203
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,740
 James was Jesus's half brother.

204
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,180
 He was a key leader in the early church.

205
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,980
 He was a key leader in the church in Jerusalem.

206
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,060
 And he wrote a letter to the Christians spread out

207
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,420
 across the Mediterranean area.

208
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,420
 And the letter focused on living a life of authentic faith.

209
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,020
 He wanted Jesus's followers to live lives of authentic faith.

210
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,940
 And so in the first chapter,

211
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,860
 he talks about that we should not just be hearers

212
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,180
 of God's word, but we should be doers.

213
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,380
 So we're meant to hear God's word,

214
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,620
 but we're also meant to put it into action.

215
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,380
 And so we really emphasize that.

216
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,060
 And then a lot of this authentic faith that he talks about,

217
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,060
 it was about how we relate, especially to those in need.

218
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,260
 You know, how we express it,

219
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,820
 that we don't discriminate,

220
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,460
 that we care for the widows, the orphans,

221
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,260
 those who are living in crisis.

222
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,660
 And that when we do that, you know, we bring honor to God.

223
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,100
 We live out of that image of God that he has given us.

224
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,260
 And we live out of that, that righteousness,

225
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,140
 that holiness, that love to those around us.

226
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,820
 And so that's where we're gonna pick up the story in James,

227
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,340
 or in James chapter two.

228
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,300
 And it says this, verse 14.

229
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,580
 What good is it, my brothers and sisters,

230
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,380
 if someone claims they have faith, but has no deeds?

231
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,180
 Can such faith save them?

232
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,980
 Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.

233
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,180
 If one of you says to him, go in peace,

234
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,860
 keep warm and well fed,

235
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,380
 but does nothing about their physical needs.

236
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,380
 What good is it?

237
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,780
 In the same way, faith by itself,

238
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,140
 if it is not accompanied by actions, is dead.

239
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:37,700
 So James here, part of the scenario

240
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,700
 is he's addressing Christians who somebody has argued

241
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,620
 that you can separate faith and works,

242
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,260
 that you can just have faith.

243
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,020
 You can just have this mental ascent.

244
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,940
 You know, I believe in Jesus.

245
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,460
 I have a relationship with him and that's it.

246
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,180
 Nothing else is needed.

247
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,180
 And James is saying, uh-uh, that doesn't make any sense.

248
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,020
 That's not how it works.

249
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,260
 Faith and actions always belong together.

250
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,860
 You cannot separate them.

251
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,380
 And so he raises that question.

252
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,020
 He says, how can someone claim to have faith,

253
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,980
 but have no deeds?

254
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,940
 Because we see faith when there's deeds, right?

255
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,620
 We see that then expressed.

256
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,660
 And what is the usefulness of that kind of faith?

257
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,900
 If you say you have faith, but it never expresses itself

258
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,700
 in any practical way or form towards other people.

259
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,660
 And he even raises the question,

260
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,900
 does that person have an authentic, a saving faith?

261
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,700
 If you claim to have faith, but there is no actions

262
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,500
 of loving and caring for people around us.

263
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,100
 Because if the spirit of God is living in you,

264
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,020
 surely he will move you, mobilize you to start loving

265
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,860
 and caring for the people around you.

266
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,860
 Then he asks us to imagine the scenario.

267
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,900
 So I wanna dive a little bit in with you on that.

268
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,780
 He says in verse 15, suppose a brother or a sister

269
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,780
 is without clothes and daily food.

270
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,020
 Everyone picturing that?

271
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,580
 If one of you says to them, go in peace

272
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,980
 and keep warm and well fed, but does nothing

273
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,020
 about their physical need, what good is it?

274
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,300
 Now, it'll be easy to rush past this part.

275
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,660
 I used to rush past this part when I read James.

276
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,860
 But just think of this, the person is described as naked.

277
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,660
 That means they have no clothes.

278
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,380
 They lack one of the most basic necessities

279
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,620
 to protect themselves from cold weather,

280
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,420
 warm weather, rainy weather, from parasites,

281
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,820
 from other dangers.

282
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,580
 I mean, they're extremely vulnerable.

283
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,380
 And then they're also described

284
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,380
 that they're lacking daily food.

285
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,940
 So that means they're not just like one time

286
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,700
 not having enough to eat for one meal.

287
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,340
 It's like a regular thing.

288
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,580
 They're just, they don't have what it takes to live,

289
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,020
 to have the nutrients to flourish and thrive.

290
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,340
 And then we're supposed to imagine

291
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,940
 that somebody says to them,

292
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,940
 like, go in peace, keep warm and well fed,

293
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,340
 and then just walks away.

294
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,260
 Isn't that ridiculous?

295
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,180
 Doesn't that make you upset?

296
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,860
 I feel like there's no reaction.

297
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,940
 Yes?

298
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,380
 Right, it's stupid, right?

299
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,220
 Come on.

300
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,180
 And so that's exactly James' point.

301
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,420
 He's like, it is ridiculous that somebody

302
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,940
 has such desperate needs to ignore them

303
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,820
 and to just blabber spiritually.

304
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,340
 You know, just to say these spiritual words and phrases,

305
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,700
 but do nothing about the personal need.

306
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,980
 And so James is saying,

307
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,300
 faith and actions, they belong together.

308
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,900
 We cannot separate them.

309
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,260
 And so in verse 70, he says this,

310
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,820
 "In the same way, faith by itself,

311
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
 "if it is not accompanied by action,

312
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,500
 "is that authentic faith is always expressed in actions."

313
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,380
 It always is.

314
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,540
 Authentic faith is always expressed in actions.

315
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:21,060
 So this reminds me of social media,

316
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,060
 hashtag thoughts and prayers.

317
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,900
 Anyone?

318
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,540
 Anyone else?

319
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,940
 Okay, let me explain.

320
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,260
 So, you know, one of the things,

321
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,980
 whenever there's a world crisis,

322
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,740
 let's say there is a, we just had,

323
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,260
 I don't know, was it Helen, Helene,

324
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,380
 the natural disaster in the US,

325
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,260
 or war, or school shooting,

326
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,740
 or whatever else it may be, right?

327
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,820
 And then people, they send their thoughts and prayers

328
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,100
 on social media, hashtag thoughts and prayers.

329
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,020
 And recently, there's been, like the last several years,

330
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,700
 there's been a lot of pushback on that.

331
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,260
 Like, hey, you say thoughts and prayers,

332
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,540
 but you never do anything about what's happening.

333
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,420
 Especially like, if it's a politician,

334
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,700
 you know, he says thoughts and prayers,

335
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,380
 but they actually have power to do something about policies.

336
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,380
 So people have been getting really fed up

337
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,340
 with sending thoughts and prayers.

338
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,060
 And from, if you look at James's example,

339
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,100
 we can understand why,

340
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,900
 because if people say spiritual stuff,

341
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,420
 but there's never any action,

342
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,100
 people are asking, what good is it?

343
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,780
 If you see, go in peace, stay, you know,

344
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,300
 well fed and warm.

345
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,980
 But I've seen also that,

346
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,780
 so I wanna talk about it a little bit.

347
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,020
 Let me go back on that.

348
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,820
 Now thoughts and prayers in some circumstances,

349
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,380
 I think it's an okay response, right?

350
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,900
 Like something's geographically far removed.

351
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,300
 We're not right there.

352
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,260
 We think about the people, we pray for them.

353
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,300
 We trust that God works through prayers.

354
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,940
 You know, that is not a bad thing necessarily.

355
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,540
 Or there might be very complex issues

356
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,060
 where there is no easy, simple, straightforward response.

357
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,420
 In James, the response is clear.

358
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,780
 There's a person that's naked

359
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,820
 and a person that's malnourished.

360
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,500
 So you know what to do.

361
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,980
 But sometimes we don't always right away know what to do.

362
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,500
 Maybe it takes some time to figure out what to do.

363
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,900
 And so thoughts and prayers

364
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,140
 and in those circumstances can be okay.

365
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,940
 And the reason why I say this is,

366
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,660
 as a pastor, I've seen that people have picked up

367
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,220
 on this criticism of thoughts and prayers.

368
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,900
 And I think we should take this serious

369
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,500
 because we should not just be people

370
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,020
 who say thoughts and prayers and that's it.

371
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,700
 But at the same time, what I've seen even Christians do,

372
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,300
 throw out the faith part and just focus on actions.

373
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,980
 And they're actually meant both to stay together.

374
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,620
 You know, that we do pray, but that we also do act.

375
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,020
 And so one thing that I wanna say is that

376
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,540
 we should never use the complexities of an issue

377
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,500
 where maybe it takes us a while to respond

378
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,020
 as an excuse for never doing anything.

379
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:08,020
 And I think we have a tendency to do that as a church.

380
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,460
 And so putting all of this in context

381
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,620
 and our God of just sermons here

382
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,340
 is I wrote this statement, it says this.

383
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,020
 Jesus did not restore us for life

384
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,940
 so that we only offer thoughts and prayers to people.

385
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,580
 But he has restored us for life

386
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,140
 so that we contribute practically to the physical,

387
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,980
 relational, emotional, and spiritual needs of people.

388
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,700
 That we do both, that we pray and that we act.

389
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,860
 Can I get an amen?

390
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,460
 - Amen. - Thank you.

391
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,020
 All right, just making sure we're engaged here.

392
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,020
 Now in 2007, my father, he passed away of cancer.

393
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,060
 And something that I just found out not too long ago,

394
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,300
 I think last year about him,

395
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,300
 was that he supported a mom, a single mom with a daughter

396
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,820
 together with one or two friends for 18 years.

397
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,580
 Gave substantially financially to this family

398
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,000
 to make sure the daughters cared for the schooling,

399
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,540
 the clothing, and all these things.

400
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,020
 He never talked about it.

401
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,060
 And I found this out about my father.

402
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,540
 And I was like, wow, that's so beautiful thing

403
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,780
 to learn about your dad that you didn't even know it.

404
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,020
 You know, he never said anything.

405
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,020
 And for me, that was the way that he was able to help.

406
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,380
 He worked a lot, he had finances,

407
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,580
 so he could help financially someone.

408
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,060
 But there's different ways that we can help and love

409
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,420
 and bring up people who are in need of help

410
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,300
 and support around us.

411
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,820
 And by the way, everybody here

412
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,900
 has something they can contribute,

413
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,860
 has a gift, a talent, has time that you can use

414
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,560
 to bring up people around you who are in need.

415
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,460
 So whether that is your practical skills,

416
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,360
 maybe you're good at fixing something,

417
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,820
 or maybe you help somebody fix their washer.

418
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,040
 If that's good with sewing,

419
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,020
 well, maybe you help somebody sew things

420
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,020
 so they don't have to buy those things.

421
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,280
 If you're good at listening,

422
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,900
 maybe just spend time with people

423
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,280
 and just listen to them and care for them.

424
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,060
 If that's inviting people into your family

425
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,260
 to be part of your family,

426
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,740
 that's also a way of just loving and bringing up people,

427
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,900
 because not everybody has a normal family experience.

428
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,680
 As I was praying for the service,

429
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,700
 I really had the sense that actually this was a word

430
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,220
 or encouragement for somebody.

431
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,300
 That it was somebody who was thinking about

432
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,180
 hosting and just welcoming people in their family,

433
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,720
 and I felt like I should encourage that.

434
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,320
 So here's an encouragement for whoever this may be.

435
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,640
 Now, the important thing is that we do put our faith

436
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,660
 in action, and that our faith does not just consist

437
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,680
 of words, of empty words, right?

438
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,720
 And that we can reflect this character, this image,

439
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,360
 being image bearers of God,

440
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,120
 that we can reflect it in our relationships with others,

441
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,840
 and just bring them up, share the love of Jesus,

442
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,080
 share the concern of Jesus, be kind,

443
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
 lift people up around us who are struggling

444
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,960
 so that they can thrive, that they can flourish.

445
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,040
 So I have this statement that I think sums up

446
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,080
 what James is saying here.

447
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,560
 It says this, "Real faith is seen through our actions

448
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,080
 "when we lift up those in need."

449
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,360
 No, real faith is seen through our actions

450
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,600
 when we lift up those in need.

451
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,640
 So I think this raises for all of us the question,

452
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,080
 do we have real faith?

453
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,320
 Are we lifting up people around us who are in need?

454
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,520
 And if we're not, I think we need to start praying

455
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,920
 and thinking about this.

456
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,320
 And it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor,

457
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,440
 if you're a man or a woman,

458
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,400
 if you feel like you have lots of talents,

459
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,040
 little talents, everyone has something to offer,

460
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,200
 something can contribute.

461
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,840
 If you make yourself available to God,

462
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,520
 everybody has something to offer to bring others up.

463
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,560
 Every single person.

464
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,600
 Now, I'm excited.

465
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,160
 I've invited two people, Debra and Pradeep,

466
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,840
 to share with us about their journey

467
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,080
 of putting their faith into action.

468
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,920
 And so let's, as they come up here,

469
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,000
 let's welcome them, I'm excited.

470
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,160
 (audience applauding)

471
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,120
 Thank you.

472
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,280
 (audience applauding)

473
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,600
 I have my cue cards here.

474
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,840
 I'm prepared.

475
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
 All right.

476
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,400
 So to begin with, can Debra also have a microphone?

477
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,200
 Thank you.

478
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,800
 So to begin with, I would just love to hear,

479
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,840
 not everybody here knows you,

480
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,520
 I would just love to hear maybe a little bit about you,

481
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,960
 who you are, how long you've been in Hong Kong,

482
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,840
 what you're doing here,

483
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,160
 and maybe perhaps we can actually start with Debra

484
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,120
 and then have Pradeep share after that.

485
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,320
 I'm born and raised in Hong Kong,

486
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,160
 and I live in America for 10 years

487
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,840
 before I returned to Hong Kong as a missionary

488
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,080
 about 23 years ago.

489
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,400
 I joined the Yuen Long last year in April.

490
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,000
 How about you?

491
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,760
 Okay, my name is Pradeep and I'm from South India.

492
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,480
 My wife Cynthia and I,

493
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,120
 we are living in Hong Kong for past two years,

494
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,080
 working as cross-cultural missionaries in Shanti,

495
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,840
 an NGO, and then we are part of Y Nuen Long

496
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,360
 from the time the church was launched.

497
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,000
 Wonderful.

498
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,480
 I love both of them, they're amazing.

499
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,600
 So I'm super excited about this time here.

500
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,080
 (audience applauding)

501
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
 So one thing that I was thinking about,

502
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,760
 you know, how do you get started on this justice journey?

503
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,720
 How do you, like, was there something

504
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,160
 that like sparked you on this journey?

505
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,040
 And so we'd just love to hear about that.

506
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,240
 Yeah, sure, I believe the journey started

507
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,880
 during the time when I was in America,

508
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,320
 about 30 years ago.

509
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,320
 I became foster parent to take care of children

510
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
 who needs a home.

511
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,200
 And at that time I was doing that

512
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,120
 because of money,

513
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,520
 because I was a stay-at-home mom

514
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,280
 and taking care of my children,

515
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,800
 so I want to bring some income home.

516
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,280
 And so I started this journey,

517
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,560
 but when I started this journey

518
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,920
 and God let me see something different

519
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,440
 when I'm doing the foster care.

520
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,160
 And also the church in America

521
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,200
 always taught us to open our house,

522
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,160
 our home for other people in need.

523
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,160
 And our church always have a big meeting

524
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,240
 and those attend the church.

525
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,960
 And so there's people that will attend the meeting

526
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,960
 and they came from different places in the country.

527
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,920
 And so we will open our home to let them stay with us

528
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,240
 and also cook them meal while they're staying.

529
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,920
 Cool, so that's your origin story of fostering

530
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,240
 and also welcoming people from, you know,

531
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,480
 these conferences in your home.

532
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,160
 And yeah, how about you Pradeep?

533
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,880
 So growing up in India,

534
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,600
 somehow I developed this idea that Indians,

535
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,320
 that means we share gospel,

536
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,240
 we share Jesus through words.

537
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,360
 And missionaries from West,

538
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,160
 they share Jesus through actions and serving people

539
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,040
 like building hospitals, building orphanages

540
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,880
 and schools kind of stuff,

541
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,000
 because I believe they have a lot of money

542
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,280
 and we don't have money.

543
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,640
 So all that we can do is like,

544
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,360
 we just share gospel through our words.

545
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,080
 But my perspective changed when my parents,

546
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,840
 my dad and my mom, they're pastors,

547
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,360
 when they started a home for the orphans

548
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,720
 and they gave shelter to eight boys for a long time.

549
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,560
 So I see my mom,

550
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,800
 she cooked three meals every day for a long time

551
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,960
 and I never see her complaining or grumbling a single time.

552
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,120
 And my dad, he provided for all of us,

553
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,200
 the eight boys and three of us, the same things.

554
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,680
 So there was no partiality between us.

555
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,120
 And I always see my parents,

556
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,960
 my mom was always joyful after working the whole day.

557
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,920
 And my dad was so peaceful after providing for so many of us

558
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,400
 with the limited resources.

559
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,480
 So that helped me to understand like,

560
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,080
 serving others does not need a surplus amount of resources.

561
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,880
 All that it needs is a heart

562
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,680
 that's full of compassion and sacrifice.

563
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,800
 Yeah, and we also started--

564
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,600
 (audience applauding)

565
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,160
 And as kids, three of us, me and my two siblings,

566
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,600
 we started sharing the things we have.

567
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,000
 And I believe like that's how my journey

568
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,440
 of putting faith in action started.

569
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,120
 - So it starts a lot of times,

570
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,320
 even with the little that we have

571
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,720
 and making it available to people

572
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,920
 and experiencing how God works through that.

573
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,760
 Yeah, wonderful.

574
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:12,000
 I'm curious, so we're talking about putting faith in action

575
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,640
 and James, there's an emphasis particularly

576
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,200
 on the marginalized and the vulnerable.

577
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
 And so I wonder, what does that look like for you now

578
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,480
 to put your faith and action

579
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,640
 towards the marginalized and vulnerable

580
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,600
 and those in distress?

581
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,440
 So maybe Deborah.

582
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,720
 - Yes, when I returned to Hong Kong as a missionary,

583
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,240
 at one point by faith,

584
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,840
 God gave me a ministry to open my home

585
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,280
 to house some people that they are in need.

586
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,360
 So I started to let people to stay with me.

587
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,960
 Some drug addicts who want to get off drug,

588
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,480
 some came out from prison.

589
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,360
 And there are some children who were in trouble.

590
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,240
 And then also about 15 years ago,

591
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,240
 I also let, I invited a mother who came from Mother's Choice

592
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,080
 with her newborn baby to stay with us.

593
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,840
 So 15 years had gone and the girls grow up

594
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,280
 and became part of my family, yes.

595
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,720
 - Wow, amazing.

596
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,560
 (audience applauding)

597
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,160
 - And now at this stage of my life,

598
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,000
 I'm a volunteer in this church

599
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,600
 and also I'm a tutor, volunteer

600
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,840
 to teach non-Chinese children homework.

601
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,440
 - Well, Deborah, yes.

602
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,800
 (audience applauding)

603
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,040
 You know, you're so courageous.

604
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,360
 And so yeah, what an inspiring example

605
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,560
 for just how you welcome people in your home.

606
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,040
 How about you, Pradeep?

607
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,520
 - So I would say understanding

608
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,080
 that I need to put my faith in actions.

609
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,560
 It changed the course of my life

610
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,800
 and I got clarity in finding my purpose

611
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,520
 and it opened doors for me to come Hong Kong

612
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,120
 and serve in Shanti where our main focus

613
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,800
 is working with ethnic minorities,

614
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,040
 especially the children and youth

615
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,680
 who I think they are more vulnerable in the society.

616
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,040
 So Shanti has given me a few opportunities

617
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,640
 where I can serve them in different ways.

618
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,360
 And the first thing is like we know their need,

619
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,880
 know what they need and then like try to help them

620
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,160
 in any way you can.

621
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,720
 And first thing is like we empower them

622
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,600
 in education through tutorials

623
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,400
 so they understand Chinese and math better

624
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,640
 and they get confident in their academics

625
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,960
 and also in their life.

626
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,840
 So we do not judge them when they come to us

627
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,840
 so they feel they are accepted.

628
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,720
 We listen to them so they feel they are valued

629
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,240
 and we pray for them so that they understand

630
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,680
 that Jesus loves them and God has a plan

631
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,960
 and purpose in their lives.

632
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,480
 And the last thing is whatever we are able to provide,

633
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,080
 we will provide the basic needs

634
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,560
 so that they feel that God cares for them

635
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,400
 and God provides for them.

636
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,240
 - Wonderful.

637
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,080
 (audience applauds)

638
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,920
 Thank you.

639
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,560
 Yeah, I'm, you know, even just like I shared earlier

640
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,200
 with the tutoring, right, like I can even relate to that

641
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,120
 because I really have myself received that type of help.

642
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,360
 So it's amazing, makes such a difference.

643
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,040
 I wonder this journey of like putting faith in action,

644
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,780
 it's not always easy.

645
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,880
 There is challenges along the way

646
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,640
 and I just would love if you can share a little bit

647
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,240
 about some challenges or oppositions

648
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,740
 and how you dealt with them.

649
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,800
 - Well, I have learned so many things in this journey

650
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,600
 which transformed my life.

651
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,520
 Yes, I've been hurt many, many times

652
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,920
 and many, many tears too.

653
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,880
 And due to a lot of frustration and discouragement,

654
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,280
 I sometimes would doubt about God.

655
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:46,780
 And I pray for these people to change and get out of trouble

656
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,900
 but they didn't change.

657
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,820
 And many times they lied to me, they stole from me

658
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,820
 and they die of overdose of drug and they commit suicide.

659
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:05,660
 And many didn't even say a word of thank you

660
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,940
 and just accusing me of not doing good enough.

661
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,480
 And so, well, how to deal with it?

662
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,260
 I just always cry out to God.

663
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:20,280
 And also I ask God to help and be merciful to me

664
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,400
 and to others.

665
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,800
 - Wow, thank you for sharing that.

666
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,980
 How about you, Pradeep?

667
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,560
 - So I would say the expectations.

668
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,400
 So after pouring out all the love

669
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,760
 and pouring out all the service in their lives,

670
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,320
 sometimes you may not really see

671
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,480
 the expected result in their life.

672
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,120
 So after working for a long time,

673
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,080
 maybe there is no visible change in their life

674
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,480
 or their situation.

675
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,920
 And sometimes their life or character,

676
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,980
 their situation gets worse after a course of time.

677
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,000
 So when we don't say anything, we feel discouraged

678
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,080
 that after pouring out everything,

679
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,840
 the result is not as we wanted.

680
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,080
 So that's one thing, we get discouraged.

681
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,160
 And the second thing is after giving and giving

682
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,060
 and serving and serving, sometimes we feel like we are empty.

683
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,040
 So I would say that's the time where we have people

684
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,000
 who are godly people who surround us,

685
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,080
 who stands with us to pray and support us in every way.

686
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,240
 So when we have godly people with us, it really encourages.

687
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,100
 So they feel us and then we get more strength and courage

688
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,680
 to go and serve people again.

689
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,040
 - You know, following Jesus,

690
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,000
 Bible doesn't say that it's easy being a disciple.

691
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And so there are tough parts when we live for his glory

692
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,320
 and just love and serve people unconditionally.

693
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,600
 And so we wanted to keep this conversation authentic

694
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,560
 but also hear about how you deal with those challenges

695
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,380
 along the way.

696
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,480
 So thanks both of you so much for sharing those.

697
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,800
 It's okay, you can clap.

698
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,520
 (audience applauding)

699
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,040
 There's so much love coming your way.

700
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,440
 It's like you say a few words and everybody

701
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,540
 is just so supportive of you guys.

702
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,340
 What encouragement actually do you have for everyone here

703
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,680
 about putting their faith and action and loving our neighbors

704
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,300
 and bringing people up?

705
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:16,000
 - Well, I believe all of us have the love and compassion

706
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 from God, but due to different reasons and hurt in our life,

707
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,960
 we don't use them, we don't develop it

708
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,900
 and we don't function properly.

709
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,880
 And God called different people to do different things

710
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,880
 in different situations and so we don't need to compare.

711
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,060
 And we do whatever and whenever we can.

712
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:48,060
 And if you don't know what, then I'm sure if you ask God,

713
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,680
 God will show you and tell you what.

714
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,680
 And start from our home with small task is important.

715
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:02,200
 And knowing that God is always so merciful to us

716
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,900
 and help us and we need to learn to offer unconditionally

717
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:15,080
 and being generous to others with a pure heart

718
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,520
 and that is important.

719
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,260
 A lot of times we may have expectations.

720
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,560
 We want to, we expect something to happen,

721
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,440
 we expect a very good result.

722
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,440
 But a lot of times expectations may lead to disappointment.

723
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,100
 And so we have to understand that transformation

724
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,020
 of people's life, appreciation and reward

725
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,300
 have to come from our almighty God.

726
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:54,600
 And so finally, let us not become wary in doing good.

727
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,040
 For the proper time, we will reap a harvest

728
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,600
 if we do not give up.

729
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,600
 So no matter the task is great or small, known or unknown,

730
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:16,280
 please don't give up and keep focusing on God

731
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,800
 and keep trying to use the God-given compassion

732
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,620
 to help our neighbors.

733
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,880
 - Thank you Debra.

734
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,280
 Yeah, how about you Pradeep?

735
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,440
 (audience applauding)

736
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,880
 - So I have, I feel like God has taught me a few things

737
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,000
 in this journey of missions

738
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,520
 and I just want to share a few of them with you.

739
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,520
 And the first thing is, it's not about how much you have,

740
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,880
 it's all about what you have

741
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,800
 and how you use it in serving others.

742
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,720
 The second thing is like,

743
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,340
 it's not about what your neighbor is worth of,

744
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,160
 it's all about like what we have received from Jesus.

745
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,640
 The grace, the love that we have freely received,

746
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,280
 that we freely give to them.

747
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,320
 And the next one is like, if we are available to God

748
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,600
 and if we are sensitive to our neighbors,

749
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,520
 God will show us the opportunities,

750
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,240
 how we can serve our neighbors through actions.

751
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,160
 And the last thing is like,

752
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,280
 no matter if you are sowing seeds or if you are planting,

753
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,880
 but remember that God is the one who gives growth

754
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,160
 and your reward will be with the Lord

755
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,080
 when he comes back a second time.

756
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,280
 - Amen.

757
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,680
 Let's give them a big hand.

758
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,800
 Thank you so much.

759
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,960
 (audience applauding)

760
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,280
 I'm just amazed.

761
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,640
 I was so encouraged when I read,

762
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,360
 so I gave them a questions and they wrote out some things

763
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,520
 and just hearing right now what they're sharing

764
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,840
 and just their faithfulness in loving those around them

765
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,800
 and bring them up, it's amazing.

766
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,000
 And I know I'm encouraged and inspired,

767
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,680
 I hope you are as well and you found this helpful

768
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,160
 of what putting our faith and action can look like.

769
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,080
 For me, one thing that was on my heart for today

770
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,200
 was like in a justice sermon series,

771
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,720
 it's really easy to talk so abstract,

772
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,760
 that we maybe never personally connect

773
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,760
 to what we talk about.

774
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,800
 But God wants to involve every one of us.

775
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,680
 He has sent us out to heal

776
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,600
 and he wants to use you to bring up other people,

777
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,960
 to share God's love with other people,

778
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,120
 to allow them to flourish and thrive.

779
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,760
 And as we heard, he's given every one of those things

780
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,280
 and we can be generous with whatever it is that we have,

781
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,960
 our time, our resources, our gifts, our talents.

782
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,200
 And if we make ourselves available to God,

783
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,160
 then he will use us.

784
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,800
 And so I opened up with a question,

785
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,720
 I wanna invite the worship team to come up by the way.

786
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,840
 I opened up with a question,

787
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,840
 how can we narrow this gap between our faith

788
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,040
 and what we believe about justice and mercy

789
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,720
 and putting that into action?

790
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,600
 You know, what does that look like?

791
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,320
 And we're all at different points on this journey.

792
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,800
 You know, every single one of us are at different points.

793
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,040
 And that's okay.

794
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,920
 But my sense for today was that just like

795
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,840
 as I was just moved by the mercy and the love

796
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,520
 and the kindness of God on that day,

797
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,160
 when I was thinking about how all these people

798
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,560
 that helped me in my life,

799
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,640
 that God just reveals his goodness, his love,

800
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,240
 his mercy to you.

801
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,000
 And that as he does that, that he also nudges you,

802
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,800
 that the Holy Spirit nudges you and says, it's time.

803
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,400
 It's time to put your faith into action.

804
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,920
 It's time to take that next step.

805
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,880
 It's time to make yourself available to the King of Kings

806
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,960
 for the incredible work that he wants to do

807
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,520
 through your life.

808
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,240
 Come on, people.

809
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,680
 I'm excited about that.

810
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:04,560
 And so what I wanna do is I wanna actually create a space

811
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,320
 for us to pray.

812
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,600
 And I brought up some practical ways

813
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,400
 that we can think about people around us.

814
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,720
 There's four, actually there's multiple questions.

815
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,560
 Can we please bring those up, please?

816
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,960
 There is, how is my neighbor doing relationally?

817
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,760
 How's my neighbor doing physically?

818
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,840
 How's my neighbor doing mentally?

819
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,320
 How's my neighbor doing spiritually?

820
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,600
 And all of this, of course,

821
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,880
 assumes that we actually talk to people

822
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,680
 and that we get to know these things about their lives.

823
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,320
 But as we pray, as Pradeep shared,

824
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,440
 as we just ask God and Deborah as well,

825
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,000
 he will show you how he can love

826
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,560
 and bring up people around you.

827
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,000
 And you're gonna be able to do it

828
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,880
 'cause it's God speaking to you.

829
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,160
 He has gifted you.

830
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,560
 He has put his spirit inside of you.

831
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,400
 And so I wanna just ask us right now just to pray

832
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,560
 and just ask the Holy Spirit,

833
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,360
 Holy Spirit, how do you want me to love

834
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,120
 and serve those around me?

835
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,640
 So let's do that for a minute and then I'll pray over us.

836
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,680
 Let's pray right now.

837
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,400
 (gentle music)

838
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,440
 (people chattering)

839
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,040
 (gentle music)

840
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,040
 (people chattering)

841
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,680
 Holy Spirit, come.

842
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,840
 Holy Spirit, come.

843
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:17,720
 I wanna invite everyone to stand.

844
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,320
 (gentle music)

845
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:26,040
 You know, we don't love our neighbor

846
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,560
 out of our own strength.

847
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,680
 We love because he first loved us.

848
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,200
 And some of us, you know, we're tired, we're exhausted.

849
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,160
 Right now we're like,

850
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,400
 this guy's just talking about me doing stuff.

851
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,320
 But the Holy Spirit can fill us

852
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:46,360
 and can give us the strength and the grace to do his work.

853
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,000
 We don't do it out of our own strength.

854
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,240
 We do it by the power of the Holy Spirit.

855
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,760
 So I wanna invite you,

856
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,640
 if you wanna be filled by the Spirit,

857
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,320
 just stretch out your hands.

858
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,000
 Just say, Lord, I'm here.

859
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,640
 I wanna be filled by your Spirit.

860
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,160
 I wanna receive from you right now

861
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,240
 so that I can pour it into others.

862
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,600
 So stretch out your hands before,

863
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,400
 you know, I just wanna pray over us.

864
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,760
 Holy Spirit, will you fill your people?

865
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,880
 Will you pour your mercy, your grace, your strength,

866
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,600
 your love into the people's hearts?

867
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,040
 We love others not by our own strength,

868
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,880
 but because of your strength,

869
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,400
 because of you at work in us,

870
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,920
 because of your love, because of your power,

871
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,000
 because of your grace, because of your mercy.

872
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,720
 So will you fill your people right now?

873
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,800
 Thank you, Holy Spirit.

874
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,120
 Renew your people, strengthen your people.

875
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,160
 Recharge your people now.

876
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:56,440
 Release faith that you can use us.

877
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:03,640
 Lead us into opportunities, divine appointments,

878
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,880
 where we're the ones who can help.

879
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,000
 We're the ones who can pour out your love.

880
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,680
 May you be honored and glorified.

881
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,840
 I pray this in your name, Jesus.

882
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,000
 Amen, amen.

883
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,560
 Let's worship church.

884
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,920
