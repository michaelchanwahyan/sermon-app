1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,340
 Amen, awesome.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,000
 All right, so I'm not gonna do that for everybody.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,860
 Don't worry, we're good.

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,240
 I know that every time I get into the pulpit

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,040
 here at the Vine, I get super excited

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,900
 and I often will say to you, I'm so excited today.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,560
 But I am genuinely really excited today

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,780
 for what I think the Lord wants to do in us in this moment,

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,160
 for what I think He wants to do in the weeks ahead

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,500
 as we start a new sermon series here today.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,620
 I wanna teach actually over the next four weeks with you

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,420
 on the topic of personal transformation.

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,180
 And I'm really excited about this

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,560
 because I don't know how you feel

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,720
 as you've come into church today, as you've joined us online,

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,280
 whether you feel like life is the best

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,980
 that it's ever been for you,

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,640
 or whether you feel like there's pain and trauma

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,100
 and there's some sort of thing

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,600
 that's kind of a suffering in your life,

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,960
 whether you're feeling great or you're really struggling,

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,600
 the weight of Scripture would show us

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,020
 that one of the primary functions of the ministry of Jesus

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,500
 is to take us from who we are today

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,000
 and to move us to become more and more like Him.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,300
 At the very heart of what is the ministry of Jesus,

27
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,560
 both the scriptural ministry,

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,220
 but also the ministry of Christ in the world today

29
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,760
 through the power of His presence and His Spirit

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,140
 is to take us from the people that we are right now

31
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,620
 and help us to become more a reflection of Him

32
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,640
 in the world around us.

33
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,720
 In other words, God's primary focus of His heart as a Father

34
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,680
 and the Spirit's primary work in your life

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,480
 and Jesus's primary focus

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,440
 is to help this transformation process happen in you

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,800
 so that you can begin to be the very person

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,320
 that He longs for you to be.

39
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,720
 And so none of you have come into church today by mistake.

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,400
 I believe none of you watching online

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,960
 in the overflow in this room right now,

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,680
 none of you are here just for an event.

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,640
 You are here because there is something in your life

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,360
 that the Lord wants to touch, wants to liberate,

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,000
 wants to heal, wants to restore.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 There's something in you that He wants to move His Spirit over

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,160
 and do such a renewal and a restoration work

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,540
 that you would feel like you've become the person

49
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,380
 that you're designed to be.

50
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,880
 If you're anything like me,

51
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,160
 you can recognize that there are some areas in your life

52
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,480
 that you wish were healed, restored, renewed,

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,840
 that you wish you were a better person.

54
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,920
 And I believe that over the next four weeks,

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,800
 God is gonna drop into your spirit some of the keys,

56
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,120
 some of the ways in which you can grow and transform

57
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,360
 and become that person that He longs to be.

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,920
 That's why I'm excited today.

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,500
 And this all links back to what we shared with you

60
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,440
 at Vision Sunday here at The Vine in March.

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,320
 If you've been coming to The Vine for a while

62
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,160
 at the beginning of March, every year,

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,760
 we share a Vision Sunday where we tell you

64
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,880
 about the sense that we have as a leadership

65
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,320
 about God's heart for us as a church community.

66
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,160
 And back then we mentioned

67
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,440
 that we are in an uncharted territory season,

68
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,640
 that the Lord is wanting to move The Vine

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,240
 into uncharted territory.

70
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,880
 And what we explained to you about on that first Sunday

71
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,160
 in March is that this is always the call of the Lord

72
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,920
 when He wants to do something significantly new

73
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,840
 amongst His people.

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,960
 Uncharted territory is literally territory

75
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,160
 where we have no map, we've never been there before,

76
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,880
 there is no idea or strategy for what it is,

77
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,320
 but God wants to take us from where we are today

78
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,840
 and He wants to place us where we've never been before.

79
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,720
 And when we're in this season of uncharted territory,

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,760
 it's an adventure, it's a joy,

81
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,400
 but it's also kind of scary

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,200
 because we don't know how to define it.

83
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,040
 We don't know exactly what it's gonna look like,

84
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040
 we don't know exactly how it's gonna happen

85
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,880
 and what God does in a season of uncharted territory

86
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,120
 is He calls us to faith, He calls us to trust Him.

87
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,440
 Because there isn't a strategy, there aren't resources,

88
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,680
 there isn't the map to know where it is that we're going,

89
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,840
 but we have this sense that He wants to take us there.

90
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,160
 And I feel like for some of you in this room,

91
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,560
 in this journey of personal transformation,

92
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,600
 that resonates with you.

93
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,800
 It's like, you're like, I wanna be different,

94
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,280
 I wanna be better, I wanna be more wise,

95
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,120
 I wanna be more Christ-centered,

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,000
 I wanna be more compassionate,

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,560
 I wanna have breakthroughs in my work,

98
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,920
 I wanna just be a better human being.

99
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,320
 You're kind of feeling it in your spirit,

100
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,000
 but it's uncharted.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
 You're not sure where it's going to go,

102
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,640
 but God say, don't worry, I've got you.

103
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,640
 And I'm gonna come and I'm gonna work in your life

104
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,280
 and gently step by step,

105
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,080
 you're gonna transform and be renewed

106
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,760
 into something truly beautiful.

107
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,880
 And at that Vision Sunday,

108
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,280
 I shared with you a word that the Lord had given me

109
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,680
 whilst I was in the Camino de Santiago in Spain,

110
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,600
 this pilgrimage last year that I did on my sabbatical.

111
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,480
 And as I was walking in Spain,

112
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,400
 God gave me a word for us as a community and as a church.

113
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,120
 I wrote it down here on this very piece of paper.

114
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,680
 And I read this to us back in March,

115
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,880
 but I wanna read it again,

116
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,360
 because this is still the season we're in.

117
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,600
 And as we move to the second half of the year now,

118
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,680
 this is still a thing that resonates on his heart

119
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,400
 for us, so let me read this to us.

120
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,240
 It says this,

121
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,920
 "I am about to move the vine into uncharted territory.

122
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,120
 I desire to take you to places you have never been,

123
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,920
 to stretch you beyond what you're currently comfortable with.

124
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,400
 These are uncharted territories,

125
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,160
 and they are necessary for your faith and my work.

126
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,880
 You do not have the strategy, resources, gifts,

127
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,120
 or wisdom for what is coming.

128
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
 That is not the issue.

129
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,480
 All you need to begin is faith and courage."

130
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,320
 Let me just stop there.

131
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,640
 "All you need to begin is not the answer,

132
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,800
 is not how everything's gonna pan out,

133
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,400
 is not how everything's gonna look at the end of it all.

134
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,280
 All you need right now," the Lord is saying,

135
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
 "is faith and courage."

136
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,320
 Father, I wanna pray faith and courage

137
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,800
 into the vine community.

138
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
 Lord, I wanna pray that you would fill the people

139
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,280
 in this room with a greater faith and courage

140
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,200
 for their personal transformation.

141
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
 I wanna pray, Lord,

142
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,800
 that you would put such faith inside of them,

143
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,480
 that every day they would wake up and say,

144
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,240
 "I know that today is gonna be better

145
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,400
 than what's been behind.

146
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,720
 I know that the Lord is with me,

147
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,400
 and if he is with me, who can be against me?"

148
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,280
 Lord, I pray for a release of courage amongst your people.

149
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,240
 In Jesus' name, everyone says.

150
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,480
 So all you need to begin is faith and courage.

151
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,320
 This is about complete trust in me.

152
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,080
 What I will give you, though, is a burden.

153
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,960
 I will give you a new heart.

154
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,440
 I will make you unsatisfied for the here and now.

155
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,480
 I will place my hand upon you

156
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,800
 and stir up the joy of the pursuit of me.

157
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,040
 I'm not calling you to a vision with knowledge

158
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,320
 of all that is ahead.

159
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,120
 No, this is uncharted territory.

160
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,360
 What I am calling you to is a value,

161
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,680
 the value of complete and total surrender,

162
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,480
 a holy dissatisfaction in the way things have been,

163
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,160
 and a passionate longing for the discovery of more.

164
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,880
 And then I wrote in brackets just below it,

165
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,640
 "Preach on this sometime."

166
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,680
 But I love this because that statement there

167
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
 is really the summary, if you will,

168
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,680
 of what personal transformation is all about.

169
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,680
 This is how it begins, a holy dissatisfaction

170
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
 in how things currently are,

171
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,680
 and a longing and a faith and a courage that there's more,

172
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,600
 that there's more for me, there's more for my future,

173
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,040
 there's more for who I am,

174
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,880
 there's more depths of Christ

175
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,400
 that the Lord wants to open up for me,

176
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,120
 there's more compassion that he wants to place within me.

177
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,600
 I'm not the final product today,

178
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,960
 and God has given me a new heart,

179
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,320
 a new burden to seek and be on my knees

180
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,720
 and to pray and believe that greater will be ahead of me

181
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
 what has been behind me.

182
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,240
 And this is the starting point of any journey

183
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,520
 of personal transformation, a burden for change.

184
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,680
 And what I wanna do today and over the next four weeks

185
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,880
 is unpack a little bit about what this burden

186
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,360
 for change in us looks like,

187
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,440
 and some of the keys by which we can take that burden

188
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,400
 and truly live it out in our lives.

189
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,240
 Interestingly, over the last six months,

190
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,280
 I've been praying this exact passage,

191
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,120
 this exact group of God's word over us, for us.

192
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,280
 And as I've been praying it,

193
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,040
 he led me about four months ago

194
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,600
 to the Old Testament book of Ezra.

195
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,520
 Now, I don't know if you've ever read the book of Ezra before

196
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,360
 or if you've ever heard anyone preach

197
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,440
 from the book of Ezra before,

198
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,160
 but the book of Ezra is this significant book

199
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,480
 in the narrative of the Old Testament.

200
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,600
 It happens about sort of three quarters of the way

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,640
 through the Old Testament in terms of its chronology,

202
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,480
 but the book of Ezra narrates and chronicles

203
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,280
 a significant time in Israel's history,

204
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,680
 a turning point in their history,

205
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,280
 what you might call an uncharted season in their history.

206
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,160
 It's the time where Israel is released

207
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,360
 from their captivity in exile in Babylon

208
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,880
 and are brought back to their city of Jerusalem,

209
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
 the city that had been destroyed

210
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,520
 by the Babylonians some 70 years earlier.

211
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,040
 So the book of Ezra captures for us the moment

212
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,680
 where God's people are released

213
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,900
 and they're able to go back to their city,

214
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,900
 which has been desolated from the attacks 70 years before.

215
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,960
 And one of the things that you see in this book

216
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,200
 is exactly how Israel faces this work

217
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,440
 of rebuilding in their lives.

218
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,020
 And as we're thinking about what it is

219
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,440
 for us to be transformed,

220
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,160
 what does it look for the Lord to come

221
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,600
 and do a rebuilding in us?

222
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,560
 As we start the series,

223
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,960
 I wanna give you that historical context

224
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,800
 so you fully understand what we're teaching into

225
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,280
 in the moment of Israel's history.

226
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,460
 So let me just give you a bit of historical context,

227
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,380
 really important about humans in general,

228
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,200
 but also the nation of Israel.

229
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,800
 About sort of 800, 900 years before the birth of Christ,

230
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,640
 Israel that time was a confederacy of 12 tribes.

231
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,440
 And those 12 tribes were held together by a judge.

232
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,240
 And those judges were raised up

233
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,720
 and the judge could come from any of the 12 tribes in Israel.

234
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,300
 And the judge was anointed to lead the people at that time.

235
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,800
 Now, interestingly, over time,

236
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,200
 God's people decided that they no longer wanted

237
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,880
 to be just a confederacy of 12 tribes,

238
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,880
 they wanted to be a monarchy like other nations around them.

239
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,420
 They looked at some of the other nations

240
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,400
 that were around them at the time

241
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,240
 and they saw kings and queens

242
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,120
 and the power that came from a kingship.

243
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
 And so they came to the judge at the time

244
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,480
 who happened to be Samuel.

245
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,320
 And they said to Samuel,

246
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,680
 "We want you not to pass on the judge to the next judge,

247
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,240
 we want you now to anoint a king for us."

248
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,820
 So sure enough, God decides to work through Israel this way.

249
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,900
 And so Israel goes from a confederacy to a monarchy,

250
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,420
 a nation with a king,

251
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,260
 Saul the first king, the second King David.

252
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,580
 Now what happens interestingly,

253
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,500
 is that when you're a confederacy with 12 tribes,

254
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,120
 anybody from one of those 12 tribes could become judge.

255
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,780
 When you become a monarchy,

256
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,180
 monarchy is passed down through bloodline.

257
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,300
 Now, a lot of people in Israel didn't realize

258
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,380
 that that was gonna happen.

259
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,380
 And suddenly they don't like the monarchy thing anymore.

260
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,060
 They don't like the fact that power gets passed down

261
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,700
 through one family's bloodline.

262
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,300
 And in fact, out of the 12 tribes,

263
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,820
 10 of them decide to rebel against the other two

264
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,580
 and actually leave Jerusalem

265
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,580
 where they were all based at this time and go north.

266
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,700
 Go north to the area of like the West Bank

267
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,880
 as we understand it today,

268
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,400
 and parts of Southern Lebanon, that sort of area of land.

269
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,140
 The 10 tribes go there and they establish a new nation

270
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,340
 with a new monarchy of the bloodline they wanted.

271
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,620
 Now, here's the confusing thing.

272
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,940
 When the 10 go north, they decide to rename themselves Israel

273
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,380
 which is really not helpful for us

274
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,560
 when we're reading the Bible

275
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,340
 because there's the Israel of original,

276
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,180
 but now there's this new Israel

277
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,940
 of the 10 tribes that have gone north.

278
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,420
 Now, two of the tribes remain south in Jerusalem,

279
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,620
 Benjamin and Judah, and they rename themselves Judah.

280
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,060
 So now you've got Israel and you've got Judah.

281
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,900
 And if you're reading the books of like Nehemiah and Ezra

282
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,580
 and Zachariah, Jeremiah, these kinds of books,

283
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,760
 when they mention Israel, when they mention Judah,

284
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,600
 that's what they're talking about,

285
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,540
 the 10 tribes north or the two tribes south.

286
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,700
 Making sense so far?

287
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,820
 Okay, now here's what happens in 722 BC.

288
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,980
 Assyria comes and attacks the 10 tribes that had gone north.

289
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,100
 Assyria comes down from the north, attacks the tribes,

290
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,840
 and basically intermarries with many of the Jewish women

291
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,100
 and kills the majority of the Jewish men.

292
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,720
 And what happens is the offspring that is born

293
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,940
 from these Gentile Jewish relationships

294
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,060
 and the new offspring that are born

295
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,940
 would come later on in the narrative in the New Testament

296
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,860
 in Jesus' time to be known as the Samaritans.

297
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,140
 Have you ever wondered why in Jesus' day

298
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,940
 the Jewish people hated the Samaritans so much?

299
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,700
 It's because they were half-Breeze.

300
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,220
 They were half Assyrians, half Jewish people.

301
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,820
 And because of the ugliness of that,

302
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,900
 they rejected the Samaritans.

303
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,820
 But Jesus, of course, himself goes and ministers,

304
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,300
 and that's a whole nother sermon series

305
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,940
 but we're not gonna go there now.

306
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,200
 But I want you just to follow the history.

307
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,220
 So Assyria comes down, attacks, intermarries.

308
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,460
 Now, the two tribes that remain south in Jerusalem,

309
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,940
 for a while they do okay, but in 605 BC,

310
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,940
 then Babylon comes in from the east and attacks Jerusalem.

311
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,020
 And Babylon tears down the walls of Jerusalem,

312
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,780
 most importantly, destroy the temple,

313
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,980
 the first temple in Jerusalem, destroy the temple,

314
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,420
 kill many of those two tribes,

315
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,180
 but takes a remnant of God's people

316
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,660
 and brings them back into captivity in Babylon.

317
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,420
 And so for 70 years, the Jewish people

318
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,220
 are in captivity in Babylon,

319
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,020
 wondering if they're ever going to be able to return

320
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,440
 back to their beloved city of Jerusalem,

321
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,540
 even though it lies in ruins.

322
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,340
 Well, God then raises up another nation, Persia,

323
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,100
 and Persia comes in from the east of Babylon,

324
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,460
 attacks Babylon.

325
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,900
 There's basically a lot of attacking that's happening.

326
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,340
 Have you seen the Lego people coming

327
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,620
 and swarming on the Lego people?

328
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,660
 So Assyria comes, attacks,

329
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,380
 and they have a different foreign policy.

330
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,540
 In their foreign policy,

331
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,420
 they realize that there are Jewish people

332
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,940
 in captivity in Babylon, but their home is Jerusalem.

333
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,020
 So King Cyrus of Persia allows, gives permission

334
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,300
 for the Jewish people to finally return home.

335
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,660
 The Jewish people go back in three waves,

336
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,780
 each under the leadership of an individual

337
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,860
 with a specific purpose.

338
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,980
 The first wave is under a leader called Zerubbabel,

339
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,220
 and they rebuild the wall, sorry, the temple.

340
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,380
 He has permission to rebuild the temple.

341
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,060
 The second wave is under the leadership of Nehemiah,

342
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,060
 and he and those around him rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.

343
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,380
 The third wave is under the leadership of Ezra,

344
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,560
 and Ezra's role is to reestablish the law,

345
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,380
 to get the law back up and running for God's people.

346
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,920
 So with these three waves, the temple gets rebuilt,

347
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,460
 the walls get reestablished,

348
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,000
 and the law gets established in the hearts of the people.

349
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,220
 Now, here's the really confusing thing.

350
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,260
 The book of Ezra, you would think,

351
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,500
 was all about the reestablishment of the law,

352
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,420
 but that actually is chronicled for us

353
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,700
 in the book of Nehemiah.

354
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,260
 Yes, I know.

355
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,980
 The book of Ezra, funnily enough,

356
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,540
 the first half of Ezra speaks about the restoration

357
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,580
 and rebuilding of the temple.

358
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,180
 So it's Zerubbabel,

359
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,020
 but it's written through Ezra's perspective.

360
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,820
 And particularly, once you get to chapter three of Ezra,

361
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,160
 you see this incredible moment

362
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,860
 where Ezra describes all of Israel

363
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,780
 gathered back in Jerusalem,

364
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,500
 and they're standing with their feet

365
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,540
 in the ruins of the old temple.

366
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,280
 And as they're standing with their feet

367
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,540
 in the ruins of the old temple,

368
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,380
 they begin to build the new temple

369
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,720
 out of the rubble of the old.

370
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,140
 Are you still with me?

371
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,260
 Now, when I read this a number of months ago,

372
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,660
 praying for you and praying for myself,

373
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,980
 something leapt in my spirit

374
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,760
 and something shifted in me.

375
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,620
 And I realized that that moment of Israel

376
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,380
 standing in the rubble of the old

377
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,100
 to begin the process of building the new

378
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,800
 resonated deeply with me.

379
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,720
 'Cause I don't know about you,

380
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,900
 but I can see that there's still a lot of rubble in my life.

381
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,260
 I know that there are still some things in my life

382
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,520
 that lays in ruins.

383
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,260
 Some things that I've struggled with

384
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,300
 for the majority of my life.

385
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,080
 Maybe situations in my past

386
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,340
 that has created some trauma for me.

387
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,860
 Relationships that didn't work out.

388
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,860
 Insecurities is something that I've spoken to you guys

389
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,900
 a lot about over the years of leadership here.

390
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,540
 Insecurities that I've struggled to deal with

391
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,900
 and struggled to shake.

392
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,700
 When I look at my life,

393
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,500
 yeah, I'm a pastor of a church,

394
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,980
 but I can see that there are still things

395
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,180
 laying in ruins within myself,

396
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,740
 within my identity, within my confidence,

397
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,300
 within the way I see myself.

398
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,540
 There's rubble there.

399
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,340
 I'm not the way that I long to be.

400
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,440
 And I wonder if that resonates

401
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,160
 with any of you here this morning.

402
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
 I wonder if you think about your life for a moment,

403
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,920
 you would be honest and say,

404
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,960
 "There's some stuff lying in ruins in me too."

405
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,360
 There's some rubble here as well, Andrew.

406
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,000
 Some things that I've struggled with.

407
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,120
 Some trauma of my past,

408
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,680
 decisions I made that didn't work out.

409
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,520
 Things that hurt me.

410
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,980
 Maybe people did other things that hurt me.

411
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,680
 Maybe sin that I've struggled to get rid of

412
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,720
 and I'm living in the consequences of that reality.

413
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,160
 I think if we're all honest with ourselves,

414
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,880
 we would all resonate with this thought

415
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,920
 that there's still rubble here.

416
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,380
 Rubble of the old, rubble of the past.

417
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,980
 And it still seems to be that we're standing

418
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,800
 in the reality of that rubble.

419
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,560
 And if that resonates with you,

420
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,820
 the next four weeks is gonna be

421
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,080
 incredibly exciting for you.

422
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,740
 I believe incredibly exciting for me

423
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,060
 'cause I think there are some keys and some tools

424
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,840
 that are gonna help each one of us

425
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,520
 rebuild from the rubble.

426
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,200
 And so what I wanna do here this morning

427
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,520
 is I wanna read this passage

428
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,840
 that we're gonna be looking at over these four weeks.

429
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,080
 It starts in verse 10 of chapter three

430
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,200
 and it goes all the way to verse five of chapter four.

431
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,560
 And then we're gonna jump in

432
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,120
 and just look at the first couple of verses

433
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,560
 in our time together here this morning.

434
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,000
 Is this okay, everyone?

435
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,320
 You guys all right?

436
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,160
 All right, cool.

437
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,000
 Let me read Ezra 3 verse 10.

438
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,480
 When the builders laid the foundation

439
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,900
 of the temple of the Lord,

440
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,440
 the priests in their vestments and with their trumpets

441
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,260
 and the Levites, the son of Aspha with symbols,

442
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,600
 took their place to praise the Lord

443
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,080
 as prescribed by David, King of Israel.

444
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,160
 With the praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the Lord,

445
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,600
 He is good for His love endures forever.

446
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,960
 And all the people gathered

447
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,680
 with a great shout of praise to the Lord

448
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,240
 because the foundation of the house of the Lord

449
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,700
 was being laid.

450
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,120
 But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads

451
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,360
 who had seen the former temple,

452
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,880
 wept aloud when they saw the foundation

453
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,020
 of the new temple, the second temple being laid.

454
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,520
 While many others shouted for joy.

455
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,080
 No one could distinguish the sounds of shouts for joy

456
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,600
 from the sound of weeping

457
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
 because the people made so much noise

458
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,640
 and the sound was heard from far away.

459
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,880
 When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard

460
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,600
 that the exiles were building a temple for the Lord,

461
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,280
 the God of Israel, they came to Zerubbabel

462
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,480
 and to the heads of the families and said,

463
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,680
 let us help you build because like you, we seek your God

464
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,780
 and have been sacrificing to Him since the time of Escherdon,

465
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,300
 the King of Assyria, who brought us here.

466
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,180
 But Zerubbabel, and you can almost certainly hear

467
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,300
 with the fire and the passion of the Lord within him

468
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,020
 and Jeshua and the rest of the heads

469
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,860
 of the families of Israel answered,

470
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,900
 you will have no part with us

471
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,220
 in building a temple to our God,

472
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,940
 for we alone will build it for the Lord,

473
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,220
 the God of Israel, as King Cyrus,

474
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,620
 the King of Persia has commanded us.

475
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,660
 Then the peoples around them set out

476
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,840
 to discourage the people of Judah

477
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,380
 and make them afraid to go on building the temple.

478
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,620
 They hired counselors to work against them

479
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,900
 and frustrate their plans during the entire reign

480
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,780
 of Cyrus, King of Persia,

481
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,420
 down to the reign of Darius, King of Persia.

482
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,900
 So there's this idea that God has anointed them

483
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,740
 for this project of rebuilding.

484
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,020
 There's resistance against that project.

485
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,220
 Zerubbabel stands firm and he says,

486
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,340
 mm-mm, we're not gonna listen to your voice.

487
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,380
 We're gonna stand firm on this in the Lord.

488
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,540
 And but throughout the whole time of rebuilding,

489
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,580
 there are people around saying,

490
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,640
 this is never going to amount to anything.

491
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,020
 I wonder if you've ever had somebody in your life

492
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,140
 that no matter how excited you are,

493
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,820
 no matter how much you're excited about the future,

494
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,000
 no matter how bubbly you might be,

495
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,940
 they're the naysayer and the voice of doom in your life.

496
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,700
 And that's not gonna happen.

497
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,060
 You don't have the resources.

498
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,180
 You don't have the network.

499
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,180
 You don't have the friends.

500
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,380
 Have you seen yourself lately?

501
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,900
 We've all got these people in our lives

502
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,500
 that are trying to tell us that we cannot do

503
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,940
 the very thing that the Lord has said we can do.

504
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,260
 Any process of personal transformation

505
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,180
 is gonna have to wrestle with the naysayers and the doubters.

506
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,620
 And here's what happens.

507
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,300
 They're not always external.

508
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,900
 Sometimes they're internal.

509
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,380
 Now notice what happens at the start.

510
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,740
 When the builders laid the foundation

511
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,620
 of the temple of the Lord.

512
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,700
 Let's just stop there.

513
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,100
 Ezra begins this beautiful moment,

514
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,900
 this significant historical moment

515
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,420
 of the building of the second temple.

516
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,260
 And he says, here's the reality.

517
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,420
 At the moment we're standing there,

518
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,960
 our feet are still in the ruins of the old temple.

519
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,260
 Our feet are in the rubble of the old,

520
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,260
 but then the builders come

521
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,340
 and the builders begin the process of restoration.

522
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,820
 What I love what Ezra does here,

523
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,380
 and you can see Nehemiah doing something similar

524
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,140
 in his description of this event as well.

525
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,960
 They're not shying away from the reality

526
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,100
 that their glorious Jerusalem is now lying in ruins.

527
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,940
 In fact, we see this more profoundly,

528
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,220
 I think, in the book of Nehemiah.

529
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,460
 So let me just jump to Nehemiah 4, verse two.

530
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,460
 Let me read this to you.

531
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,940
 It says this, in the presence of his associates

532
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,100
 in the army of Samaria, he said,

533
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,980
 what are these feeble Jews doing?

534
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,020
 This is another one of those naysaying voices.

535
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,980
 Will they restore their wall?

536
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,700
 Will they offer sacrifices in a temple?

537
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,740
 Will they finish in a day?

538
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,300
 Can they bring the stones back to life

539
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,460
 from those heaps of rubble, burned as they are?

540
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,340
 So I want you to see the actual picture

541
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,860
 of Jerusalem in this moment.

542
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,500
 And the naysayers describe it and Nehemiah captures it.

543
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,740
 They're literally standing in the ruins.

544
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,740
 It's literally like so bad that the stones are so burnt,

545
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,020
 so broken up, so desecrated,

546
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,460
 that the enemies are taunting Israel.

547
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,780
 And they're saying, have you not seen the stones?

548
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,980
 Don't you realize that there is nothing

549
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,380
 that can come from this?

550
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,500
 How could life ever come from these stones

551
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,100
 as burnt out as they are?

552
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,620
 And what I love about what Ezra is doing in chapter three

553
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,460
 is he's not hiding from the reality

554
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,760
 that the stones are burnt.

555
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,900
 He's not trying to cover up the reality

556
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,060
 that Jerusalem is desolate at this time.

557
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,180
 He's not trying to pretend

558
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,980
 that things are better than they are.

559
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,060
 He's not trying to sweep the issues under the rug.

560
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,900
 He's not trying to say that,

561
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,980
 hey, we just need a fresh thinking about what the,

562
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,420
 no, he's actually going, okay, we are standing here.

563
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,420
 And yes, the stones, they're burnt out, they're broken.

564
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,020
 He's like, this has to be our starting point.

565
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,180
 And I think what we see here is a profound first idea

566
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,660
 when we think about our own journeys

567
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,800
 of personal transformation.

568
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,660
 It's always going to begin when we take a good,

569
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,140
 honest, and sober look and admit and acknowledge

570
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,420
 what lies in ruins in our life.

571
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,220
 No one has ever changed until they've realized

572
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,680
 that they need to change.

573
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,020
 And so here's a moment where Ezra is not trying

574
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,620
 to sweep it all under the rug.

575
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,380
 He's putting out that Nehemiah,

576
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,900
 letting us know what those stones actually look like,

577
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,140
 burnt and broken.

578
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,020
 And they're doing it 'cause they're trying to say,

579
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,540
 that's the beginning point.

580
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,560
 And if you want to change,

581
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,620
 if you want the Lord to do something in your life,

582
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,340
 it is going to start when you realize, you know what?

583
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,760
 I admit there's some ruins in me.

584
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,860
 I admit that there are some areas of rubble

585
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,820
 that I wish they weren't there, but they are there.

586
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,140
 I'm struggling with the reality that this is here.

587
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,340
 Notice this, you will never become the person

588
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:13,340
 God longs you to be until you first actually wrestle

589
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,340
 with who you are and understand and own the person

590
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,700
 that you are today.

591
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,900
 You're never gonna become the person

592
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,820
 that God longs for you to be until you first take

593
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,100
 that understanding and that ownership of who you are today,

594
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,740
 putting your hand up in your spirit and in your heart

595
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,180
 before the Lord, maybe doing it before others

596
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,260
 in your small group community and saying, I'm struggling.

597
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,420
 I mean, it's hard.

598
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,740
 I got some trauma I'm struggling to shake.

599
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,420
 I got some sin that I can't seem to deal with.

600
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,040
 I got some insecurities that are still present,

601
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,700
 whatever it might be for you.

602
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,620
 Our starting point is, this is honestly

603
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,900
 what's going on in my life.

604
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,380
 This is who I am.

605
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,700
 I'm not hiding from it.

606
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,420
 I'm not trying to run from it.

607
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,380
 I'm not trying to pretend that it's not there.

608
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,180
 I'm not coming in on Sunday, raising my hands

609
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,140
 and singing these great songs for Jesus

610
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,860
 and then doing all the things I'm doing in the week.

611
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,020
 No, eventually I have to lay the line in the sand

612
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,900
 and say, there's rubble here.

613
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,380
 There's rubble here.

614
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,580
 There's things laying in ruins and it's not right.

615
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,620
 And I want the Lord to change me 'cause I've got a burden.

616
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:23,540
 I've got a longing inside of me, a holy dissatisfaction

617
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,260
 for the way that I am and I longing for more.

618
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,940
 That's where it begins.

619
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,980
 That's where it begins in this moment right here

620
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,260
 for God's people standing in the rubble of their life.

621
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,540
 And as they're standing there and they're realizing

622
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,540
 that this is the starting point,

623
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,900
 just to acknowledge the reality that there is rubble there,

624
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,420
 I want you to see what happens next.

625
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,980
 This is so important.

626
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,220
 They come to realize something

627
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,620
 and they come to make a decision.

628
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,620
 They realize that God's renewal always begins in the rubble.

629
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,460
 God's renewal always begins in the rubble.

630
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,260
 And so if step one is to say, I can see some places

631
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,980
 in my life where there's ruin and rubble,

632
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,540
 step two is to go and that's the playground of Jesus Christ.

633
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,300
 Like the ruins and the rubble is where God

634
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,580
 gets most excited.

635
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,620
 The stuff that's broken in me, if his primary focus

636
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,220
 is to move us to become more and more like Christ Jesus,

637
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,060
 he sees the rubble inside of me and he gets excited

638
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,900
 for the change that's coming.

639
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,140
 You see, God looks at the rubble in your life

640
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,940
 and he's not repelled or repulsed by it.

641
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,940
 Instead he rejoices and he rolls up his sleeves.

642
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,300
 He looks over you and he says,

643
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,220
 okay, I can see some stuff you're struggling with.

644
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,400
 I know things are hard, I know this is challenging,

645
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,660
 but I see you and I see the person you're becoming.

646
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,420
 And I'm so excited that I can draw alongside of you.

647
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,380
 I'm not repelled by that brokenness.

648
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,620
 I'm not repelled by the rubble around you.

649
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,540
 No, the rubble is my playground.

650
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,460
 The rubble is the very place that I take and transform.

651
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,180
 Notice this, Israel does not see the rubble

652
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,340
 and the burnt out stones, get rid of them all

653
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,820
 and then bring in some other stones.

654
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,580
 They take those stones and they lay the foundation

655
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,020
 of the new temple.

656
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,580
 It's the same with Jesus.

657
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,900
 He takes the rubble of our lives and he doesn't go,

658
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,820
 away it goes.

659
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,460
 He takes the rubble and he restores and renews it.

660
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,380
 The very thing that we thought could never come to any good

661
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,900
 comes good so that he receives the glory.

662
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,380
 And with an enemy are taunting Israel,

663
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,020
 have you seen the stones?

664
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,460
 Don't you realize that nothing good can come from that?

665
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,980
 Burned as they are, Israel had to make a choice.

666
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,380
 They had to make a choice 'cause they could see the stones,

667
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,340
 same as everybody else.

668
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,500
 Their choice was, are they going to see the stones,

669
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,740
 agree with the taunters and say, you know what?

670
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,620
 I don't think anything good can come with it.

671
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,820
 Or were they gonna see the stones and say,

672
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,620
 hang on a sec, sure, I can see how burned out they are,

673
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,540
 but that's just the possibility then

674
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,740
 for God to do an even greater miracle.

675
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,380
 That's just therefore the way for God to come

676
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,620
 and restore and renew in ways that we can never do.

677
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,300
 Are they going to choose to go with the enemy's voice

678
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,540
 or are they gonna choose to go with a voice of faith?

679
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,500
 And every single one of us,

680
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,260
 if we want any transformation in Jesus Christ,

681
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,940
 we are always gonna come to the same decision point.

682
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,420
 Some of you, I know I do this.

683
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,060
 I look at some of the brokenness in me and I think,

684
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,740
 I don't think God could ever do anything with that.

685
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,460
 And immediately I'm operating from a place of defeat.

686
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,820
 I have to make a decision.

687
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,260
 Do I really believe that the rubble is the Lord's playground?

688
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,580
 Do I really believe that what I thought burnt as it is

689
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,620
 could never come to anything good,

690
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,940
 that if God touches it, it can come to life?

691
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,820
 Jesus, as the widow comes out of the village of Nain

692
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,940
 with her dead son in a casket, touches the casket,

693
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,220
 and he says, "Arise."

694
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,500
 Do I believe that the Spirit of God can touch the rubble

695
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,900
 that lays ruin in me and stay alive?

696
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,420
 It's a challenge.

697
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,980
 It's a challenge because it's easy for us to, I think,

698
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,380
 listen to the rubble than it is to stand in faith

699
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,220
 with the Lord.

700
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,540
 Some of you need to realize that when you look at the rubble

701
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,980
 of your past and you just see failure,

702
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,900
 God looks at that rubble and he sees your good future.

703
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,460
 What you think is the rubble of your past,

704
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,820
 God sees as the building blocks of your future.

705
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,060
 He sees the very thing that he can't wait to do

706
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,540
 in your life, the very thing that he seeks

707
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,220
 to transform and renew.

708
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,020
 He sees the rubble, but he sees it and rejoices.

709
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,460
 He rolls up his sleeves and he's like,

710
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,100
 "Do you wanna get to work?"

711
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,500
 The question we should have is then,

712
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,420
 "Yeah, I think I do, Andrew, but I don't know how.

713
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,940
 "Like, how do we start?

714
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,940
 "What is the starting posture of my heart?

715
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,000
 "How do I resonate to what you're saying here today?

716
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,260
 "It's resonating, but how do I move forward?

717
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,780
 "What is my starting point?"

718
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,180
 Well, I want you to see what happens in verse 10 and 11 here.

719
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,300
 It says this, it says,

720
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,660
 "When the builders laid the foundation

721
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,500
 "of the temple of the Lord,

722
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,460
 "the priests in their vestments and with trumpets,

723
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,980
 "and the Levites, the son of Asher with their symbols,

724
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,260
 "took their places to praise the Lord

725
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,340
 "as described by David, king of Israel.

726
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,360
 "With praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the Lord,

727
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,100
 "'He is good, his love to Israel endures forever.'

728
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,580
 "And all the people gave a great shout of praise

729
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,480
 "to the Lord because the foundation

730
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,140
 "of the house of the Lord was made."

731
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,000
 This should blow your mind 'cause it blows mine.

732
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,900
 As they're standing in the rubble,

733
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,140
 and as the first builders begin to take that rubble

734
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,100
 and begin to construct the new temple,

735
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,380
 here's what we see Israel doing.

736
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,540
 They're worshiping, they're praising,

737
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,900
 they're clashing symbols together,

738
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,180
 they're jumping up and down, they're shouting for joy,

739
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,860
 they're making so much noise

740
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,420
 that it's heard from far and far away.

741
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,580
 Israel's having a worship dance party

742
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,040
 whilst they're surrounded by rubble.

743
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,160
 Now, I don't know about you,

744
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,160
 when I'm aware of the rubble in my life,

745
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
 I don't feel like a worship dance party.

746
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,160
 In fact, when the rubble is in my life,

747
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,560
 when the ruins, I mean, I'm aware of them

748
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,120
 and I'm soberly seeing them,

749
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,880
 I wanna run in the other direction, I wanna get away.

750
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,360
 I don't want someone clashing symbols around me

751
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,960
 and going, "Praise Jesus."

752
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,840
 I wanna run to a cave and escape.

753
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,980
 Anyone with me?

754
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,880
 Like we have this kind of averse thing,

755
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,440
 like we're in the rubble,

756
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,480
 the last thing we think is to praise,

757
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,880
 here's Israel in the rubble and they're finding a voice.

758
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,600
 I'll tell you what,

759
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,040
 when I'm aware of the pain of my rubble,

760
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,440
 there are words coming out of my mouth,

761
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,680
 but you would not wanna hear them on a Sunday.

762
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,840
 But here's Israel, great as our God,

763
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,480
 singing away, clashing the symbols,

764
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,800
 having a party as the temple's being rebuilt.

765
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,640
 And this should really challenge you

766
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,720
 because here's the thing,

767
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,180
 as Christians, our primary posture in worship

768
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,540
 is to worship as a response to something God has done

769
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,420
 rather than at the beginning of something

770
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,340
 we're hoping Him to do.

771
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,660
 Come on church.

772
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,220
 Like as Christians, largely,

773
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,660
 we find worship rising up inside of us

774
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,940
 because the prayer was answered,

775
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,940
 because the thing we had hoped for did happen,

776
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,340
 because the healing that we needed came through.

777
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,620
 And when those things happen,

778
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,540
 we stand back and we go, "God is awesome.

779
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,820
 "God is great."

780
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,240
 And so often as Christians,

781
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,300
 I think we base our worship in a retrospective,

782
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,560
 a reactive thing rather than a proactive thing.

783
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,160
 And trust me, when God heals you,

784
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,180
 when He does something, you should worship.

785
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,520
 You should respond in praise.

786
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,640
 You should respond in a hallelujah and in glory.

787
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
 That's an absolutely right thing to do.

788
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,080
 But when our primary posture with worship

789
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,460
 is always in response to what God is doing,

790
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,840
 then we're standing there waiting for God to do something

791
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,080
 before we give Him glory.

792
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,320
 When actually maybe we need to begin

793
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,720
 to think of worship differently.

794
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,120
 Maybe there's another kind of worship,

795
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,640
 I would argue one that is way more rare,

796
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,920
 but one that is way more powerful,

797
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,400
 the kind of worship that says,

798
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,080
 "I'm gonna praise Him long before He does

799
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,240
 "anything I've asked Him to do."

800
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,400
 Long before He's come through,

801
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,720
 long before the healing, long before the restoration,

802
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,840
 long before the temple is built,

803
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,200
 we're gonna start the process.

804
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,600
 The process, whilst we're still with our feet in the rubble,

805
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,080
 we're not gonna allow the rubble to speak louder to us

806
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,320
 than our faith within us.

807
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,840
 No, this is the time where we're going to praise Him.

808
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,840
 We're making a decision to praise right at the start.

809
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,660
 Why?

810
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,880
 Because we're not praising in response,

811
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,200
 we're praising prophetically.

812
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,760
 We're praising, asking, expecting, hoping,

813
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,000
 and seeing that we know the Lord's gonna do.

814
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,280
 He's gonna do something with this rubble.

815
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,320
 We don't know what it's gonna do.

816
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,600
 We don't know how the temple's gonna look.

817
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,880
 It could look as good as the first one.

818
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,180
 It could look different than the first one.

819
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,380
 That's not the big issue here.

820
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,200
 The big issue is God is at work.

821
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,080
 And the way I respond to God being at work

822
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,240
 is to allow my hallelujah to come out.

823
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,360
 This kind of worship is a weapon.

824
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,520
 This is the kind of worship that takes the walls of Jericho

825
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,240
 and pulls them down to rubble,

826
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,400
 and then takes the rubble of Jerusalem

827
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,680
 and rebuilds a glorious city with the name of Jesus.

828
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,320
 That's worship.

829
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,200
 And that's where these people are,

830
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,620
 and they begin to give this exclamation of the worship.

831
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,440
 Now, notice what is the content of their worship.

832
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,480
 This is powerful.

833
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,200
 Verse 11, "With praise and thanksgiving,

834
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,440
 they sang to the Lord, 'He is good.

835
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,600
 His love endures forever.'"

836
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,800
 Isn't that beautiful?

837
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,740
 That's not the content of my worship in that situation.

838
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,980
 You wanna know what the content of my worship would be?

839
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,000
 Lord, I praise you

840
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,040
 because you're gonna build a great temple, right?

841
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,880
 Like, I praise you

842
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,800
 because you're gonna make Israel great again.

843
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,320
 I praise you because our name is gonna be feared

844
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,220
 by all the Gentiles around the world again.

845
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,060
 I praise you.

846
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,900
 In other words, so often our worship

847
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:12,500
 is essentially taking our kind of our prayer wish lists

848
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,700
 and putting music to it, right?

849
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,380
 Like all the things that we want God to do for us.

850
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,740
 This is why we resonate sometimes

851
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,820
 with certain worship songs.

852
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,740
 Have you ever noticed, and this is the thing to do,

853
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,140
 have you ever noticed that some of the worship songs

854
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,580
 that you resonate to, you resonate to

855
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,340
 because they speak of a God doing something

856
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,540
 that you want God to do for you?

857
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,820
 And so our worship becomes like our prayers.

858
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,660
 Oh God, would you do this?

859
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,480
 Would you do this?

860
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,820
 Oh God, we worship you because you're gonna do this.

861
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,660
 You're gonna do this.

862
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,320
 You're right, you're gonna do this, right?

863
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,280
 You did it before, you're gonna do it again.

864
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,980
 (congregation laughing)

865
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,060
 And we begin to align our worship

866
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,060
 to what we're asking God to do.

867
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,540
 And when God doesn't do it, what happens to our worship?

868
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,780
 Israel does not stand before the Lord and say,

869
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,740
 "We're worshiping you

870
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,260
 because of what we're expecting you to do with the temple."

871
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,100
 They stand before the Lord and they say,

872
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,780
 "Our worship is not based on what you're going to do.

873
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,460
 It's not based on our circumstance.

874
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,100
 It's not based on our expectation.

875
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,800
 Our worship is simply based

876
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,220
 in your character and your nature."

877
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,780
 You are good, they say.

878
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,700
 They say, "We don't know what our future is,

879
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,780
 but we do know you are good.

880
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,660
 We don't know what's gonna happen down the line,

881
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,020
 but we do know you are good.

882
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,500
 And we're gonna base our worship

883
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,300
 in your character and your nature.

884
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,260
 We're gonna praise character over circumstance

885
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,320
 'cause our circumstance,

886
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,300
 we're surrounded by a bunch of rubble that lays in ruins,

887
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,420
 but we're gonna go with character over circumstance.

888
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,420
 We're gonna go with God's nature

889
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,740
 rather than the world's narrative."

890
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,380
 He is good, they say.

891
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,740
 His love endures forever.

892
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,640
 Man, I don't know if God's gonna heal me of my insecurities

893
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,740
 that I've wrestled with for so many years,

894
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,340
 but I do know He is good.

895
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,540
 I don't know if He's gonna answer all the prayers

896
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,540
 that I'm praying for in certain areas of my life

897
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,340
 the way that I want Him to answer it,

898
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,220
 but I do know that He is good.

899
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,020
 I don't know if He's gonna heal your cancer,

900
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,700
 but I do know He is good.

901
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,180
 I don't know if He's gonna provide that great job

902
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,300
 that you're hoping for, but I do know that He is good.

903
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,160
 I don't know if He's gonna restore and repair your marriage,

904
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,780
 but I do know that He is good.

905
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,580
 And here's what happens when we shift our worship

906
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,300
 away from retroactive, from what has happened

907
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,780
 to what we are looking for in the future,

908
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,740
 as we shift the perspective of our worship,

909
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,340
 and as we shift from circumstance to the nature of God,

910
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,620
 everything around us begins to change.

911
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,840
 You need to understand that in the Christian life,

912
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,100
 the journey of personal transformation

913
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,660
 actually happens and takes place

914
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,060
 not when we see a change in our circumstance,

915
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,300
 but when we see a change in our perspective,

916
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,060
 not in terms of how we see the world,

917
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,060
 but in terms of how we see God.

918
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,520
 I guarantee you, you will start to personally transform

919
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,180
 when you see God differently.

920
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,540
 See, when you see God as good,

921
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,220
 that changes how you need to see everything else.

922
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,500
 If that is your primary thing,

923
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,580
 everything else around you has to shift and change.

924
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,800
 Or think of it this way,

925
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,960
 when your divine perspective shifts,

926
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,980
 then your temporal reality will always be reframed.

927
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,940
 When we say He is good,

928
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,800
 everything around us begins to shift

929
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,880
 in the light of the declaration that He is good.

930
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,680
 When we say that He is the one,

931
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,800
 everything else has to fall in line to that,

932
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,820
 even though the circumstance might be trying to tell us,

933
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,060
 "Hey, these stones can't live.

934
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,560
 Look at how burnt out they are."

935
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,820
 No, no, He is good.

936
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,620
 So I don't know what's gonna happen to those prayers.

937
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,980
 I don't know what's gonna happen to my cancer.

938
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,420
 I don't know what's gonna happen to whatever it might be

939
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,260
 that I'm wrestling with in my life, but here's what,

940
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,020
 I'm reframing what I think about it

941
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,860
 because my starting point is a declaration

942
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,540
 of the nature of God, not the reality of the rubble itself.

943
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,740
 He's good.

944
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,780
 So if I really believe that He's good,

945
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,780
 then I have to believe that something's going to change.

946
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,140
 I don't know how, I don't know why,

947
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:03,840
 but I will find my voice, joy in the beginning.

948
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,320
 And I won't make my worship only a response

949
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,800
 to the great things He's done,

950
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,900
 but I will also make my worship prophetic

951
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,460
 because of the character and the nature of Him

952
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,960
 and all the change that is ahead,

953
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,660
 the burden in me to be different.

954
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,620
 So let me pull it all together and finish with this.

955
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,640
 The first part of any personal transformation journey

956
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,100
 is to say there's rubble, there's ruin.

957
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,220
 It's to be honest about it, not try to hide it,

958
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,680
 not try to push it away.

959
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,260
 Number two, once we do that,

960
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,980
 we have to recognize that God's playground is that rubble,

961
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,140
 that His renewal happens in the rubble.

962
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,060
 And when we've come to understand that,

963
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,380
 then we come to realize that our starting point

964
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,100
 is not to try to change ourselves.

965
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,740
 Our starting point is not to try to work

966
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,700
 on our circumstance.

967
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,740
 Our starting point is worship,

968
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,620
 to declare God's goodness,

969
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,420
 even in the reality of all the things that have to come.

970
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,620
 And as we declare His nature over our circumstance,

971
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:10,620
 our perspective about that circumstance begins to change.

972
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,740
 And even if the rubble looks so burnt out

973
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,420
 that we think nothing good could ever come from it,

974
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,200
 when we say He is good,

975
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,420
 we begin to think about the rubble differently.

976
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,340
 The rubble begins to look way differently

977
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,240
 when we begin to declare the goodness of God.

978
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,780
 If you're excited about a change

979
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,300
 that the Lord wants to bring your life,

980
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,660
 own where you are today, invite the Lord in,

981
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,500
 start in a place of worship,

982
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,640
 shift from circumstance to character in your worship,

983
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,700
 and look at what the Lord will do.

984
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,460
 Amen.

985
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,580
 Can I pray for you?

986
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,340
 Would you stand with me? Let's pray.

987
00:41:53,340 --> 00:42:02,780
 Let's just take a moment just to let the Spirit speak

988
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:07,340
 to each one of us personally.

989
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,500
 He's so excited about your personal transformation journey

990
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,540
 over the weeks ahead.

991
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,460
 Father, we thank you for what we've seen

992
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,620
 out of this just few verses from Ezra.

993
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,100
 Lord, we recognize that each one of us

994
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,700
 are standing to some degree in some of the ruins

995
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,500
 and the rubble of stuff that has happened in our past

996
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,720
 and the way that that has held us captive.

997
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,660
 Father, I wanna pray right now

998
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,120
 just for anyone in this room

999
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,540
 where they're overwhelmed by the rubble.

1000
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,820
 I get it 'cause I've been many times in my life too.

1001
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,660
 And maybe if that's you,

1002
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,840
 let me just pray pastorally over you.

1003
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,000
 And the pain is very real, the trauma is real.

1004
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,140
 We're not gonna sweep it under the carpet,

1005
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,420
 pretend it's not there.

1006
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,700
 Some of you are carrying great hurt and pain.

1007
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,980
 Some of you are in really difficult circumstances

1008
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,100
 and situations.

1009
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,540
 And we're not minimizing any of that.

1010
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,380
 In fact, what we've seen in the text today

1011
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,720
 is that Ezra and Nehemiah did not minimize

1012
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,620
 the burnt out rubble around them.

1013
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:15,880
 And so if you're in a season of great trauma and trial,

1014
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,780
 we just pray as a community over you right now.

1015
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,040
 And we pray that you would feel God's presence with you,

1016
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,280
 you would feel strengthened,

1017
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,080
 you'd feel the love of Christ through you,

1018
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,600
 you would feel that you're not alone,

1019
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,760
 that you have an army of people around you,

1020
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,900
 and that you would feel the wind of the Spirit

1021
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,080
 despite the reality of the pain.

1022
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,920
 So Lord, we just bless pastorally

1023
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,360
 those in our community that are really struggling.

1024
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,940
 (gentle music)

1025
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:53,640
 Father, I wanna challenge also some of those here

1026
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,040
 to make a decision today.

1027
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,480
 I feel like for some of you,

1028
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,020
 you've looked at the stuff in your past

1029
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,700
 and you looked at the rubble that's there still,

1030
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,820
 and you've kind of sided with the taunts of the enemy.

1031
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,900
 And you've looked at it and you've like,

1032
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,620
 I don't think anything good could ever come of that.

1033
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,060
 Man, I screwed up in the past, I'm on plan B,

1034
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,920
 I'm on plan C in God's eyes.

1035
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,980
 How could God ever use me?

1036
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,860
 I could understand why He's using other people,

1037
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,440
 but He's never gonna use me.

1038
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,400
 He's never gonna heal me.

1039
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,240
 That rubble is never gonna get transformed in my life.

1040
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,860
 I feel like for some of you in this room,

1041
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,300
 the starting point for you is to make a decision

1042
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,140
 in your heart.

1043
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,540
 And you may not know exactly what the Lord's gonna do,

1044
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,340
 you may not know how it's all gonna turn out,

1045
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,940
 but right now at the start of this series,

1046
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,480
 it's just a simple declaration in your heart.

1047
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,100
 I don't understand it all, Lord,

1048
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,700
 but I refuse to allow the rubble to tell me

1049
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,800
 that there is no hope.

1050
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,620
 I refuse to allow the trauma to tell me

1051
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,680
 that there is not a healthy version of me just ahead.

1052
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,380
 And I make a decision this morning in this moment

1053
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:04,940
 to take that faith and that courage

1054
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,780
 in this season of uncharted territory

1055
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,400
 in the area of my personal growth.

1056
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,760
 And then for some of you,

1057
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,720
 this worship thing is really important.

1058
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,760
 And like I said earlier,

1059
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,200
 maybe because of all the things

1060
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,200
 that are happening in your life,

1061
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,040
 the last thing you feel like doing is worshiping,

1062
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,180
 but I wanna just release over you

1063
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,980
 a gift of worship in your heart.

1064
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,680
 That today you would shift from worship

1065
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,000
 that is as a result of what the Lord has done,

1066
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,840
 as good and as important as that kind of worship is,

1067
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,040
 but worship that is a prophetic declaration

1068
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,480
 for what the Lord may or may not do in the future.

1069
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,400
 It doesn't matter.

1070
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,560
 What matters is His character and His nature

1071
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,800
 and circumstance will never shift who He is.

1072
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,200
 He is good and His love endures forever.

1073
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,520
 And Lord, I pray over anyone in this room,

1074
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,240
 online and our overflow,

1075
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,320
 who just needs to shift their worship

1076
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,400
 to the nature and the character

1077
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,280
 and the goodness of their Lord,

1078
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,960
 despite what the rubble might be trying to say.

1079
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,120
 Lord, I pray that that shift this week

1080
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,200
 would be monumental in their spirit

1081
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,560
 and in their heart and in their life.

1082
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,440
 And I pray you would raise up

1083
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,720
 like you did in Israel in those moments.

1084
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,600
 You would raise up an army of people

1085
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,920
 who would rebuild walls and rebuild temples

1086
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,840
 because they know that you are good.

1087
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,400
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

1088
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
 Everyone says, amen, amen.

1089
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,960
 (congregation applauding)

1090
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,320
