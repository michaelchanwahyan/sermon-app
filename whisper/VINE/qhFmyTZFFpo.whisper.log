[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060]   In the name of Jesus, everyone says, Amen.
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.280]   Can we thank our worship team and just awesome.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.600]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.720]   We're pretty packed in here today.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.600]   So if you need some seats, there are some seats, I think somewhere, but there are some
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600]   seats around.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600]   Again, welcome.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.480]   If you're joining us online, if you're in our overflow, we love you guys.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.880]   We're sorry that you're there, but we're glad you're with us and there is no second class
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.360]   Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.760]   Amen.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.840]   So we're glad that you're with us as well.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.760]   In 2014, something happened here at the Vine.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.800]   It was in the summer of 2014.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.720]   Something happened here at the Vine that so changed, completely changed my expectations
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.680]   of the work of Christ in the world today.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.800]   On this particular Sunday, a 25 year old French lady from a Muslim background walked into
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.680]   Pacific Coffee downstairs in search of her Sunday morning caffeine fix.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.240]   She had no idea that she had just walked into a church.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.960]   She thought she was just coming in to get a cup of coffee, but she was struck immediately
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.200]   by the reality that this Pacific Coffee was the most popular Pacific Coffee she had ever
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.700]   seen in her life.
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.360]   It was filled with lots and lots of people who were chatting and laughing and hanging
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.840]   out and talking.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.720]   And she was used to her Sunday morning caffeine fix normally being a quiet, sleepy kind of
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.900]   vibe, but here it was loud and raucous.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.080]   She grabbed her coffee and she couldn't find a seat in Pacific Coffee because it was so
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.080]   full.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.960]   So she went and she stood by the stairs at the back of our Pacific Coffee, by the stairs
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.320]   that go up into the rest of our building.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.220]   And as she's standing there sipping her coffee, marveling at how a rock concert has just finished
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:08.360]   in this space, suddenly a asylum seeker, one of our asylum seekers kids trips and falls
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.360]   down the stairs right in front of her.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.200]   And immediately she looks around to see if the parent is there and if the parent is going
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.240]   to react and respond, but she couldn't see a parent.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.640]   And so she turned and she knelt down to help this kid up.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.660]   Now, thankfully he wasn't seriously hurt at all, but she helps him up.
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.120]   And because she speaks French, that's her mother language, she just starts speaking
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.280]   to him in French.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.800]   I think when you panic and something like that happens, you just default to your natural
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   language.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.200]   She started speaking to him in French.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.600]   Amazingly though, this little boy was from West Africa and French was his mother tongue
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.800]   as well.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.700]   And so he was able to talk to her in French and he grabs her by the hand and he starts
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.720]   walking her up the stairs.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.320]   And she thinks that Pacific coffee must have a second level to it and that the parents
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.920]   are up there somewhere.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.280]   And so she follows him as he's leading her up the stairs.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.320]   He leads her up the first floor, up to the second floor.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.800]   He leads her into the doors right here, right as the worship is starting for our 11 o'clock
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.220]   service.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.600]   And as he leads her in, he then lets go of her hand and he runs away.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.520]   And she's standing there wondering what is going on.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.720]   For the next 90 minutes, the majority of the next 90 minutes, she's just stood right there
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.120]   and she's crying and crying and crying and she has no idea why she's crying.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.700]   She describes it to me just a few months later as if this warmth had just come over her.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.720]   And she said she had never felt a sense of love or peace like that in her life ever before.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.940]   At the end of the service, she comes forward speaking in French, trying to find somebody
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.180]   who speaks French.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.620]   Thankfully, there was a French family that was sitting just a couple of rows towards
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.300]   the front and we were able to connect them together and over the process of a conversation
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:17.380]   right there and then at the front of the church, this Muslim lady gives her life to Jesus.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.340]   Just a few months later, she does Alpha for the first time.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.340]   She does our French Alpha.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.820]   We were running a French speaking Alpha at that time.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.100]   She commits, further commits her life to Christ through Alpha.
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.860]   I had the privilege of baptizing her just a few months later.
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.300]   She then was one of the leaders on our next French Alpha that we ran and she had the privilege
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.880]   of leading some other people to Jesus.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.360]   She then came and stood in front of our whole church on a Sunday and told them the story
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.700]   that I've just told you and then she left us just a few months later and she's now living
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.940]   and working again in France.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.140]   Now I would love to stand here this morning and tell you that story and tell you that
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.560]   the reason why this lady gave her life to Jesus is because the Vine Church has an amazing
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.980]   evangelistic program.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.340]   That we have trained people to be on the lookout for strangers entering into Pacific Coffee
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.520]   on a Sunday morning.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.620]   I would like to tell you that we've trained all our asylum seeker kids to fake fall down
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.700]   the stairs.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.300]   They're like little stunt kids that fake fall down the stairs so that they can speak in
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.380]   French to random French speaking people who walk in.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.940]   I would like to tell you that we have brought all of our French families to the front rows
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.620]   of the church just in case a French person comes into this church.
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.620]   There's no Jesus.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.020]   I'd like to tell you that because then I could pretend that the reason why this person gave
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.100]   the life to Jesus is because the Vine is so awesome and that we have such a great evangelistic
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.220]   program but I love the fact that I can't stand here and tell you that.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.700]   I love the fact that the only reason that that woman came to Christ on that day was
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.940]   because God believed it was her time.
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.540]   Because God did it all.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.860]   That there was, I mean think about it, coming into this particular Pacific Coffee for a
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.300]   caffeine fix.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.780]   So busy that she couldn't sit so she had to stand at the back.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.060]   It just so happens that a French speaking refugee kid is able to connect with her who
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.340]   just randomly brings her up and makes her stand right there and then runs away.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.060]   And that there happened to be a French family that was willing to share the gospel with
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.060]   her.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.340]   I mean we can't make this stuff up.
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:41.140]   This is stuff that can only ever be done by a God who is able to do immeasurably more
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.940]   than we could ever ask or imagine.
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:52.780]   And when something like that happens you can only stand back and go God is amazing.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.200]   Not the vine is amazing.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.780]   Our evangelistic programs are amazing.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:06.900]   God who is able to do more than we could ever ask or imagine and because God did it that
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.140]   way.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:14.140]   That story is still one of my most favorite stories to share in some 15 years of pastoring
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.020]   here at the church.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.500]   The apostle Paul knew something of a God who is just like that.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.060]   The God who is able to do more than we could ever ask or imagine.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.260]   In fact as he finishes his prayer in Ephesians 3, that majestic glorious prayer that we looked
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:41.140]   at last week, he decides to finish it by shifting the focus of his prayer back to this God.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.580]   Which is important for Paul because he's just prayed a passionate pastoral prayer for his
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.580]   church.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.340]   I mean he needs to spend all this time saying my hope for you is that out of the glorious
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:55.620]   riches of Christ Jesus that he would strengthen you with power by his Spirit in your inner
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.620]   being.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.980]   I mean my prayer for you is that you would know that Christ lives in your heart and because
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.540]   of that you would be able to grasp how wide and high and deep and long the vastness of
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.480]   the love of Christ for you.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:13.300]   And because of that you would know that love, experience that love, feel that love so that
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.620]   you would be filled to the whole measure of the wholeness of Christ.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.500]   He's just prayed this passionate pastoral prayer for his people to experience God in
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.940]   a way that they've never experienced it before.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:30.900]   But he gets to the end of the prayer and he realizes I can't finish there because God
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.440]   is always more than what we experience of him.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.960]   And despite the fact that he's passionately gone I want you to really experience him.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.700]   What he's also saying to his church is but I don't want to limit and I don't want you
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:52.540]   to limit your expectations of God just by what you've experienced of him.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:59.020]   And so he shifts the end of his prayer back to the wonder and the majesty and the mystery
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:06.260]   and the glory of a God who's far greater than we could ever experience.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.260]   I want to read it to you.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.980]   He says this in Ephesians 3 verse 20 and 21.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:18.140]   Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than we could ask or imagine according
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:24.820]   to his power that is at work within us to him be the glory in the church and in Christ
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:32.820]   Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever and the whole church said amen.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.660]   This is known as a doxology.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:42.440]   What it is is a exclamation that praises a characteristic of God that when read should
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.700]   cause you to enter into a place of worship as well.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:52.780]   Paul writes these doxologies throughout his letters and there are many that he includes.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:59.260]   This one is one of my particular favorites and I love it for one simple reason.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.980]   Paul is challenging his church deeply on something.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:08.000]   He's asking them actually through this doxology a very important question.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.660]   It's an important question because he's about to enter into three more chapters in the letter,
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.140]   chapters four, five and six where he's going to speak about the nature that we have and
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.340]   the way that we should live in respect to God.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:25.100]   Before we get there he finishes chapter three by asking his church a critical question.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:30.300]   Who exactly is it that you worship?
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.100]   That's what he wants to ask his church and that's what I sense the Holy Spirit wants
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.340]   to ask you here this morning.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:42.260]   Who exactly is it that you worship?
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:47.500]   And this is an important question for Paul because before he tells his church how they
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:53.980]   should now live in response to this God, he wants to make sure that they're worshiping
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.860]   the right God.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.260]   And as you come into church today you might be like, "Well, of course I'm worshiping the
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.260]   right God, Andrew.
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.460]   I'm in a Christian church today and not somewhere else.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.820]   I believe in Jesus.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.220]   Of course I'm worshiping the right God."
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.140]   Paul's being a lot more nuanced than that.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.780]   A lot more actually I think challenging than that.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:18.300]   And when I read this doxology I find myself deeply challenged.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:26.620]   I've read this for years and every time I read it I'm reminded of my own deficiencies.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:34.060]   I'm actually reminded of how I so often can drift in my worship away from worshiping the
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:42.940]   God of Scripture and settling instead for worshiping the God that I have experienced.
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.100]   Are you tracking with me here?
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.740]   Now I want you to track with this because I think we can all make this mistake in our
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.740]   Christian lives.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.940]   That we end up so much worshiping the God that we have actually tangibly had an experience
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:12:01.420]   of, but we kind of settle or we see that as the roof, the ceiling of our understanding
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.260]   of who He is.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:09.060]   And so our worship, the God that we're worshiping, is essentially a God that we have experienced
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.100]   rather than the God of the nature and the character and the power and the fullness of
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.660]   how Scripture describes Him to us.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.580]   And this is very true for us particularly when we've been disappointed by God.
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:25.460]   And if you're anything like me in this room, you've been disappointed by God sometimes.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:30.100]   When we get disappointed by God or maybe God hasn't come through like we expected or our
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:36.820]   experience of God is not like the experience of the person next to us and they seem to
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.220]   cry every time they worship, they seem to get the gift of tongues and I don't seem to
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.220]   get that.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.740]   And we begin to compare our experience with God, with somebody else's experience of God,
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:52.380]   and we end up worshiping a God limited by our experience and we can feel sometimes dejected
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.260]   in that because our experience is not someone else's experience and Paul writes to the church
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.380]   and says, "Hang on a sec.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.220]   I want you to experience God.
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.500]   I mean I've just prayed this majestic prayer that you would feel His love like you've never
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.060]   felt Him before.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.020]   Think in my being desires for you to experience Him in the greatest way you could ever experience
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:14.100]   Him but never limit your thinking or your expectations.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.920]   Particularly never limit your worship just based on how you've experienced Him.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.820]   It's got to be so much more."
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:28.060]   So if I was to ask Paul's question through this doxology to us as a modern church in
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.060]   a modern way, perhaps I'd ask it like this.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:39.740]   Are you worshiping the God of your truth above the God of the truth?
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.740]   Say that again.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:47.940]   Are you worshiping the God of your truth over and above the God of the truth?
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:55.580]   Have you limited God simply to your own experience of Him whether good or bad or are you able
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:00.740]   to worship Him even beyond what it is that you may have experienced?
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:06.700]   Paul writes to the church, "Oh, now to Him who is able to do whether you've experienced
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.780]   a lot or a little, far more than you could ever have thought.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.260]   That's the God to worship."
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.140]   I want to actually show you how Paul does this.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.260]   I'm going to break this down in this doxology because I think it's really important that
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:26.980]   we wrestle with the challenge of this but also I believe because we want to raise glory
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.340]   in the church and I think this is the whole of Paul's point.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.700]   He talks about three elements in this doxology.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.060]   The first element is you.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.820]   Can you see that on the screen?
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.700]   Wow, modern technology, look at that.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.060]   By the way, I've said this before, I'm going to say it again.
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:53.860]   I am terrible at writing but just track with the ugliness of my words written down and
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.980]   follow what we're doing here.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:02.220]   When Paul says God is able to do immeasurably more than we could ever ask or imagine, there's
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.900]   an assumption Paul's making in that statement.
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.780]   Do you know what that assumption is?
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.480]   It's not a rhetorical question, it is actually a question.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.260]   What is the assumption he's making?
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:18.020]   Because if God can do more than you ever ask or imagine, what is He actually assuming?
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.540]   That you are asking and that you are imagining, which maybe for some churches that's a big
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.900]   assumption.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:30.020]   But he's assuming of his church in Ephesus that they are actually doing two things.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:35.540]   That they are asking, which is this idea of prayer, and that they are, the word he uses
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:40.540]   in the Greek, this idea of imagine, which we could think of it as like a dream, like
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:47.100]   dreaming or like a vision or the way in which we think, these things.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:53.260]   The idea of our mind being engaged in life and what we hope and dream for life.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:58.940]   Paul's assumption is that the church that you are praying and you're dreaming, that
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.340]   you are on your knees praying out for God to do some things in your life to shape and
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:07.180]   to work your life in certain ways, that you have a passion and a heart to believe that
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.620]   prayer can change things.
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.900]   And that you're not just praying for yourself, but you're praying for our city of Hong Kong
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.580]   in such an important time as this and that the church together is praying and believing.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.980]   He's assuming that that's what's happening.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.980]   He's also assuming that you're not just praying, but you're dreaming.
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:28.420]   That you've got some ideas, that you're thinking, that the thoughts of your mind are hopeful,
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.540]   that you're dreaming for a better future for Hong Kong, that you're dreaming for a better
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.380]   future for yourself and for your family.
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:39.380]   That that future is not just some future out there, but is rooted in the kingdom and rooted
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:44.180]   in God's heart, that you're imagining what it would look like if the kingdom of God came
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.540]   to earth just like Jesus prayed about in his prayer, that it would be on earth as it is
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.540]   in heaven.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.140]   That's what's going on in your mind and your heart that you're passionate about.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:17:00.020]   This idea of praying and this idea of imagining and dreaming, Paul says this important thing.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:05.220]   He says, "According to the power that is at work in you."
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:13.140]   So he says that there's a power that God does to help us to pray and help us to dream, which
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.140]   is really important.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.540]   You're not praying and you're not dreaming or imagining in a vacuum.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.660]   The power he mentions here is that power he's just prayed about in the prayer in a few verses
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:30.340]   earlier, that you would be strengthened with power by the spirit in your inner being.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.420]   He's like, "That power is already at work in you, for you have already been rooted and
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.580]   established in love."
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.340]   And because that power is at work in you, you can trust that the prayers that you're
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.940]   praying are on the heart of God.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.740]   You can trust that the dreams and the imaginations that you hold in your heart have been placed
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.420]   there and are being fanned into flame by the spirit of God.
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.660]   It is a wonderful, beautiful thing.
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.420]   God doesn't ask his church to pray and leave it in a vacuum.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.580]   He asks his church to pray and he asks his church to dream for a better future, but then
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:08.660]   he puts his power inside of us to enable us to do that in a way that brings true fruit
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.660]   in this world.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.420]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.380]   No one thinks that's beautiful.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.100]   Is that beautiful?
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.700]   Now notice, he then says this though.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.980]   He says, "That's all that is assumed here."
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:26.220]   But notice this, he then says, "But there is this role that God plays."
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.460]   And I'm going to use my high school level maths here.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.420]   There's a sign in maths, greater than.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.420]   Do you see this?
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.420]   This is greater than.
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.700]   Look at that.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.140]   He says that God, here's what you need to know about God.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:44.960]   God is able to do greater than, more than you could ever ask, and more than you could
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.300]   ever dream.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.860]   And he's saying if you want to worship God, who exactly is the God that you worship?
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:56.300]   He's like, "You have to worship the one who is abundantly, immeasurably more than you
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.020]   could ever dream, more than you could ever imagine."
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.900]   Because he is so grand, so vast.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.080]   His ways are higher than your ways.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.120]   His thoughts are greater than your thoughts.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.940]   And if you've just limited him to your own experience of him, you need to break yourself
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.940]   out of that.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.620]   And he says, "Here's how you do it.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:22.860]   You believe in a God who is immeasurably more than you have ever dreamt or imagined."
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.700]   What a glorious thing he's saying here.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.960]   Now I want you to see this.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:37.360]   The problem we have in the church, the problem I think we have in us, I want that one.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.640]   That one, thank you.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:45.080]   The problem we have is that we get stuck, notice this, on this side of the equation
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.680]   I think all the time.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.000]   And we get stuck on that side of the equation for I think important reason.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.400]   Listen to this.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.260]   It is hard to believe in a God who can do immeasurably more than we could ever ask and
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:04.720]   imagine if we don't first believe in a God who can actually do what we ask and imagine.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.880]   Are you with me?
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.520]   I mean it's hard, right, to take the jump over that equation to an immeasurably more
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.760]   God if we're already struggling to have the faith to believe that he could actually do
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.560]   what we believe that he could do.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.320]   That we actually believe that he could answer the prayers that we're currently praying.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.440]   And this is why this doxology for me is so challenging because I have to reflect on my
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:34.800]   own faith and ask, "Do I really believe that God could do even just what I'm praying, let
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.080]   alone immeasurably more?
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.640]   I just need to get through the first part of the equation here."
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.760]   If you're anything like me, there's been seasons in your life and maybe you're in one of those
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.880]   seasons right now where you're actually struggling to believe that God can answer your prayers.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.160]   You're actually honestly struggling to believe that he could really come through with a vision
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.840]   or a hope or a dream that you might have.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.680]   When that happens, maybe you haven't given up on your relationship with God, but here's
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   what happens.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:08.440]   You end up settling for worshipping what I would argue is the not enough God.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.960]   No, you still believe in Jesus.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.720]   You still come to church every Sunday.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.040]   But because perhaps your prayers haven't been answered on a regular basis.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.460]   Perhaps you took that step of faith out into a business venture and it didn't work out.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.960]   Perhaps you invited that person out on a date and they said no.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.880]   Perhaps you tried to do something in faith and you felt and you had all your prayer partners
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.880]   there, everybody prayed, everybody said, "Yeah, this is what you should do."
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.880]   And you took that big step of faith and it didn't work out and that hurt.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.280]   And you felt a little bit let down by God and you felt like God was on mute in your
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   life.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.600]   And because that was so painful, because it was so public and you had done that step of
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.000]   faith, you've actually kind of stepped back from that and you've said, "I don't know if
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.040]   God does always answer prayers because he hasn't always answered mine.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:22:00.160]   I still believe in him, but I'm not sure if he's really enough."
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.780]   And so some of us get stuck on the first side of the equation here because we're actually
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.280]   worshipping the not enough God.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.240]   And maybe we never would have put a label on it until today, but if you're honest with
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.240]   yourself, you know you're part of that camp.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:20.300]   God is just not enough for me.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:25.000]   The good news is I think that most of us kind of push through that reality at some point
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.080]   in our lives and we end up then worshipping what I would call the just enough God.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.160]   And the just enough God sounds a lot better than the not enough God, but it is still a
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.000]   deficient God that we worship.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.560]   The just enough God is the God that actually does answer the prayers that we pray and does
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.320]   come through for the dreams that we hold.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.060]   I mean, track with this.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.860]   If I had said to you that there is a church in Hong Kong where everybody in that church
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:55.100]   believes that God answers prayers and God comes through on dreams, I think you'd want
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.220]   to be a part of that church, amen?
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.620]   Wouldn't you want to go to a church where everybody in that church actually believes
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:06.140]   that Jesus answers prayers, actually believes that God has visions and dreams and those
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.900]   things can actually happen in the world?
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.260]   Wouldn't that be an amazingly exciting church to be a part of?
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:16.140]   It would, but it would be a church that's worshipping the wrong God.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.560]   If I was to say to you at the beginning of this sermon that God could answer every single
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.500]   prayer you've ever prayed and come through for every dream that you could ever dream
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.780]   and are you happy to worship that God, I'm sure all of us would have said, "Sign me up
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.660]   on the bottom line.
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.860]   That's the God I want to worship, amen?"
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.180]   We think so, yes.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.540]   In fact, we think that that's the very definition of what it means to be a Christian.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.180]   "Oh man, I'm a Christian.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.900]   I actually believe that God can answer prayer.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.700]   I actually believe that He does come through in dreams.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.020]   I mean, that's what I'm supposed to believe, right?
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.020]   I do believe.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.740]   My level of faith is at that level."
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.140]   And we think that that's right and Paul comes and says, "If that's what you believe, you're
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.340]   still worshipping the wrong God.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.380]   You're worshipping the wrong God because you have limited Him still to what you're praying
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.740]   for and what you're believing in.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.580]   And even though His Spirit is at work in those things, as he's just said, His power is at
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.060]   work in you.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.820]   If you limit God to just answering your prayers and just coming through for your dreams, you've
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.300]   still created a ceiling for God.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.380]   You've still placed Him in your box.
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.260]   It's still a God of your truth."
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.460]   And Paul wants to pull his church broader and bigger than that.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.860]   And he's saying, "You've got to worship not the not enough God, not the just enough God.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:40.620]   The God that He calls us to worship is," really long word that takes ages to write, "the immeasurably
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.300]   more God."
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.940]   He's like, "This is the God that you are to worship."
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.820]   Man that's bad writing, but you know what I'm trying to say.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.660]   That looks like the immeasurably mowed God.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.700]   No, He's not the immeasurably mowed.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.700]   He's like, "This is the God."
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.140]   Like, if there's a God you are to believe in your church, it's not just one that's limited
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.980]   to the ceiling of what you can pray and what you can believe for, even though you can pray
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.180]   and believe for some great stuff.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.500]   No, He's always bigger, always greater, always more vast.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.380]   His ways are always higher than our ways.
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:14.580]   And if you're going to worship a God, you worship the immeasurably more God.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.100]   The one who can do way more than you could ever ask or imagine.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.140]   The one who can take a 25-year-old French girl who has never stood foot in a church
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:27.180]   before and so fill her with the love of Christ that she would come forward and say, "What
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.020]   is going on here?"
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:37.140]   And God could save her because that's what God does.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.580]   We never prayed for that.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.060]   We never asked for that.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.100]   I want to be honest with you.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:47.180]   I don't think we ever had the faith for that until it happened.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.420]   God is the immeasurably more God.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.580]   Now that becomes our ceiling.
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.940]   I expect that now at the Vine.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.620]   By the way, if you're a stranger in this room, welcome.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.740]   It's good to have you with us.
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.740]   You're about to get saved.
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.740]   It's awesome.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.340]   We're so glad you're here.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.300]   That's now my ceiling, but now God's light.
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:06.300]   You've got to believe for more than that then because he's always the immeasurably more God.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.300]   Are you with me?
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.860]   Are you tracking with this?
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.980]   Now then Paul finishes everything that he's saying.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.040]   He finishes it by saying there's a third element.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.220]   He said, "Then there's this reality of the church."
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.580]   I love this.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:24.260]   And he says, "The church, when God is the immeasurably more God and the church worships
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:29.060]   the immeasurably more God," he says, "then glory is seen in that church."
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.620]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.900]   It's almost as if a church has limited itself to either the not enough God or the just enough
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.940]   God, then it's going to be lacking the glory of Christ in it.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:44.180]   If you want the church to see and to feel and reveal the glory of Christ, then we have
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.300]   to worship the immeasurably more God.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.860]   Because when you worship the immeasurably more God, his glory, Paul says, is seen in
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.300]   the church.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:59.220]   It's seen in the church because when that French lady stood in front of a room of this
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:04.180]   size and shared the story that I shared with you, I mean it was hopefully impactful when
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.900]   I shared it, could you imagine when she shared it?
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:16.180]   Worship on that Sunday in this place was just off the records, off the charts.
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.980]   Because glory was seen in the church.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.580]   And why was it glory?
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.800]   Because the church could not take any credit for it.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:29.420]   It happens and everybody stood back and said, "Only God could have done that."
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.580]   And if only God could have done it, we worship that God.
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:39.140]   We're not worshiping a platform or a speaker or a type of worship or a preacher, we're
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:45.460]   worshiping God because that could only have ever happened by one who is able to do immeasurably
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.100]   more than we could ever ask or imagine.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:52.620]   And when we see it take place, how can glory not be seen in the church?
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:58.580]   How can the church not respond in saying, "Praise God, you are glorified," as Paul said,
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:05.260]   "in Christ Jesus," that the works of Christ are raised in the midst.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:15.200]   The way that a church can glory God is simply by providing an arena in which that the work
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.740]   of Jesus Christ can take effect.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.020]   That's how a church glorifies God.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:31.140]   It actually gets out of the way and enables Christ to do His work.
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.300]   And that's what we want to do here today.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.020]   And as much as it was important for you to understand what Paul's finishing his prayers
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:44.060]   with here, and I hope as we've mapped it out for you, it's inspired you and challenged
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:48.180]   you, but the reason why we've done it here this morning is because of what it leads us
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.520]   to.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.700]   It leads us to actually providing an arena in which the work of Jesus Christ can actually
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.900]   take effect amongst us.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.500]   For quite some time now as a community of leaders here, we've been praying for this
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.180]   Sunday and we've been praying for this Sunday because we knew that we were going to be setting
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.900]   aside time now for prayer and ministry.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.500]   We want to actually lean into the radical idea of the immeasurably more God that is
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.260]   amongst us.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:18.140]   What we're going to do in a moment is I'm going to invite you all to stand and we've
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:23.860]   been praying for what are some things that we can pray for you for and lay hands on you.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:29.660]   Our elders, our pastoral team, our prayer, innocences and prayer ministry team have prepared
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.140]   themselves for today.
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.700]   And what's going to happen is we're going to name a couple of things that we feel the
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.720]   Holy Spirit wants to minister to our people in today.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:44.320]   And if that resonates for you, we're going to ask you to have the courage today.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:49.440]   If you're in this room, if you're in the lower house here to come and stand here at the front
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.500]   in the middle.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.480]   If you're in the upper house, we have space at the front set aside today for this.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.040]   You can come and stand at the front in the upper house.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.480]   If it gets too busy up there, then you can actually come down to here as well.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.140]   But there is a prayer team with elders up there as well.
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.760]   If you're in the overflow today, you can come inside here for prayer.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.560]   If you're online, you can contribute in this as well.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:17.700]   You can send your prayers to us at prayer@thevine.org.hk.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:22.600]   And we would love to be able to pray with you in this moment as well.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.940]   But we're going to take some time to actually put what we've been preaching into practice.
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.800]   God is able to do immeasurably more than you could ever ask and imagine.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.360]   And as I was praying and preparing for this ministry time, I felt God say this to me,
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.800]   "Andrew, there are things that I want to do in this church that you have yet asked for
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.700]   or thought about.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.320]   You haven't even asked or thought about them yet.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.840]   There are things that I want to do in this church that you haven't yet even thought about
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.840]   or asked for."
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.160]   And as he spoke that to me, I felt like he was speaking it to you.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.400]   And I want to speak this over you.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.960]   There are some things that God wants to do in you that you have yet asked for or even
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.120]   thought about.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.560]   And we're going to make the space for that to happen now.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.560]   So let me start in prayer.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.640]   Father, we are so grateful.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.920]   So grateful that Paul would write to his church to challenge them to have a belief in a God
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:19.120]   who is not the not enough God or the just enough God, but the immeasurably more God.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.600]   And that's the God that we here at The Vine, that's what we believe in.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:27.780]   And that's the God that we're now going to pray to and believe for on behalf of the people
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.780]   in this room.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.200]   Lord, I thank you that no one is here by mistake this afternoon.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:38.280]   And Lord, you love these people so deeply and so intimately and so completely.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:43.480]   And what a privilege it is now that we get to lay our hands on one another and to pray
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:50.400]   in faith for healing and restoration and release from anything that is physically ailing the
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.400]   people in this room.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.800]   And we thank you for that.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.120]   In Jesus' name.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.300]   All right, well, if you would like to receive prayer for physical healing right now in the
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.340]   upper house, come forward in the lower house.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.860]   Please just come forward and we're going to lay our hands and pray for you.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   God bless you and God bless your family.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   God bless you guys.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   God bless you guys.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:06.540]   God bless you.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.040]   God bless you.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:07.540]   God bless you.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.040]   God bless you.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:08.540]   God bless you.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.040]   God bless you.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:09.540]   God bless you.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.040]   God bless you.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
