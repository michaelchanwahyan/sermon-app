[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Well, Chris and I were facing a big decision.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Do we stay put in the US where I was serving as a bishop
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.900]   and Chris and I were involved in training pastors
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.560]   and congregational leaders,
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.760]   or do we step out in faith
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.000]   toward a dream we had when we got married?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.460]   A dream to be involved in church
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.320]   and marketplace ministry in mainland China.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.560]   Now, we were settled.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.800]   Our son, who'd been in Chinese school in Taiwan,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.160]   loved his American school.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.880]   "No homework," he announced gleefully
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.080]   on the second day of school.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.460]   We'd bought a house.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.720]   We were learning how to manage our lawn and garden
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.280]   so the neighbors wouldn't complain.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.380]   We had two cars, a four-bedroom house on a half-acre lot
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.480]   with a nicely finished basement
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.900]   for our son and his buddies to hang out.
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.840]   We were living the American dream,
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.840]   but we had another dream, and it didn't go away.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.340]   When Chris read the news
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.900]   about the Olympics coming to Beijing,
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.740]   she felt God saying it was time for us to go to China.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.900]   Now, right after we got married, we moved to Hong Kong.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.800]   We were here during the spring of 1989
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.200]   when hope for change, for reform and opening
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.960]   was literally in the air and on campuses
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.960]   and on the streets across China and also here in Hong Kong.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.120]   But sadly, that dream had to be postponed.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.720]   Now, the Olympic Games would be coming to Beijing
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.280]   20 years later, and the whole world would be watching.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.620]   Chris had been born in China,
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.380]   but came with her family to Hong Kong
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.940]   as refugees when she was just a child.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.160]   Could this be the time for us to move to China?
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.600]   Would we be free to practice and celebrate
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.320]   and share our faith in China?
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.140]   This felt like a moment of great hope,
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.080]   but we really needed to hear from God
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.000]   to have his affirmation of our dream.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.020]   We really needed wisdom and discernment,
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.660]   and that's what we're talking about today.
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.800]   It is time to dream again,
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.480]   but we really need wisdom and discernment as we dream.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.780]   You, like Chris and me, may be facing some big decisions
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.360]   that affect not only you,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.940]   but your family and other people as well.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.640]   You need a lot of wisdom to make the right decision.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.420]   How can I be sure that my dream is really from God?
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.420]   Maybe it's just my dream and not God's dream for me.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.540]   And what if mine is an impossible dream,
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.740]   far beyond my own ability or resources?
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.140]   For these and other questions that you are facing,
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.380]   today's passage from 1 Kings 3
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.100]   will offer you encouragement and insight.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.100]   It will provide some wisdom and discernment.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.340]   So let's read together.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.260]   At Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.700]   during the night in a dream, and God said,
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.660]   "Ask for whatever you want.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.860]   "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.060]   What a fabulous dream.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.140]   God offers you anything you want.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.380]   I don't know about you, but I think I might say to God,
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.200]   "Please bring this pandemic to an end in the next month."
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.640]   What did Solomon say?
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.680]   "You have shown great kindness to your servant,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.520]   "my father David, because he was faithful and righteous
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.400]   "and upright in heart.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.200]   "You've continued this great kindness to him
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.140]   "and have given him a son."
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.620]   That would be me, Solomon,
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.800]   "to sit on his throne this very day."
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.440]   Now, I need to give you a little context.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.300]   When Solomon had this dream, he was about 15 years old
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.520]   and was just becoming king after the death of his father.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.820]   When was this?
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.760]   Well, this was about 3,000 years ago.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.800]   This was the time of the ancient Zhou Dynasty here in China,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.960]   and there were also flourishing civilizations in India,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.860]   in Egypt, Middle America.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.420]   Who exactly was Solomon?
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.340]   King David's son, yes,
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.340]   but David had many wives and many sons.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.460]   Bathsheba was his mother.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.900]   Does that ring a bell?
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.740]   Bathsheba was the granddaughter of one of David's closest
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.980]   and most trusted advisors.
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.460]   Now, listen carefully
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.460]   because the story gets a little messy here.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.320]   Bathsheba became King David's wife
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.040]   after he raped her and got her pregnant.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.940]   She was a married woman.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.080]   And then David arranged for the murder of her husband
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.340]   so he could legally marry Bathsheba.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.080]   Now, David eventually repented.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.560]   You can read this repentance in Psalm 51.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.800]   But he paid big time for his sin
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.180]   in the lives of his children and also politically.
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.560]   David had a lot of sons,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.680]   and the transition to Solomon becoming king
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.840]   did not happen with a lot of turmoil and bloodshed,
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.220]   but that's for another day.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.160]   As you can see, the Bible doesn't hide the flaws
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.660]   of its leaders and heroes.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.320]   We know the best and the worst of King David.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.520]   And we also learn about the sins of some of his sons,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.500]   including Solomon, but I'm getting ahead of the story.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.800]   Solomon is still a teenager,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.920]   and he seems to have only respect for his dad
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.760]   who has already passed away.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.160]   He was faithful to you.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.420]   He was righteous, upright in heart.
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.920]   Well, a filial exaggeration for sure.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.920]   But maybe, just maybe Solomon hasn't yet learned
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.840]   the shocking truth about how his mother
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.500]   became King David's wife.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.480]   You know, he's only 15.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.220]   As a young boy in the royal family,
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.220]   Solomon may well have been protected by his mother
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.740]   from all the pain and violence there had been in his family
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.240]   since his father's sordid affair.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.920]   Even as a teenager, Solomon is soon going to learn
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.600]   that God did forgive David
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.040]   when he sincerely and deeply repented.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.340]   And God did bless David in spite of what we might think of
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.700]   as unforgivable sins.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.240]   But teenagers have dreams.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.760]   Some of you are teenagers,
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.640]   and you are dreaming of a world better
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.000]   than the one we are giving you.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Lord, have mercy on us older folks.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And keep dreaming, young people.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.780]   We need you to help us build a better world.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.200]   So Solomon has this amazing dream.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.080]   God is offering him anything he wants.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.980]   How to choose?
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.320]   Wealth, long life, beautiful women, power, fame?
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.140]   Let's see what Solomon chose.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.880]   Now, Lord God, you have made your servant King
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.400]   in place of my father David.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.400]   But I'm only a little child.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.160]   I do not know how to carry out my duties.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.320]   Your servant is here among the people you have chosen,
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.200]   a great people, too numerous to count or number.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.160]   So give your servant a discerning heart
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.200]   to govern your people and to distinguish
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.960]   between right and wrong.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.960]   For who is able to govern this great people of yours?
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.120]   Now, remember in Solomon's dream,
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.880]   he could have anything he wanted.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.160]   He could have wealth, fame, or power.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.240]   Instead, the teenager who is becoming King
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.100]   humbly recognized his youth and immaturity.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.440]   I'm too young.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.940]   I'm just a child.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.520]   There's no way I can handle this job.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.560]   Too many people.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.560]   So give me a heart sensitive to you.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.880]   And give me the ability to govern all these people wisely.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   Give me a clear moral compass to discern
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.760]   between right and wrong.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.880]   What is true and lasting?
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.720]   And what is short term and soon to be forgotten?
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.840]   Help me to choose what is best.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.720]   In his dream, Solomon listened to God.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.680]   He chose wisdom over wealth.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.800]   He chose justice over power.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.520]   He chose being right over being famous.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.840]   He chose the good of the people
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.540]   rather than his own success.
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:58.060]   We are beginning to dream again, aren't we?
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.360]   Even though we're entering the third year of the pandemic
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.600]   without a clear way out, we want to stop waiting.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.480]   We want to make some important decisions
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.280]   and we want to hear from God.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.240]   I know you're following our Dreaming Again devotionals
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.480]   that come out at 6 a.m. every day.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.560]   I had the privilege of helping to put these together
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.720]   and to read them before you got to read them.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.600]   These devotionals will help you dream again.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.120]   And they continue for a week after our fast ends
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.560]   next Sunday.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.120]   So what are your dreams at the beginning of 2022?
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.160]   I'll tell you how my nephew Hugo in New York City
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.860]   was dreaming before Martin Luther King's birthday last week.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:54.960]   I have a dream that one day I won't wear a mask anymore.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:02.140]   Are you dreaming along with Hugo?
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.440]   Are you dreaming of traveling again?
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.360]   Are you dreaming of a promotion,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.020]   of getting your finances in better shape?
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.920]   Are you dreaming of finally getting married
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.220]   or of having a baby?
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.440]   In that order, please.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.080]   Are you dreaming of success in sports
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.640]   or as a singer or a musician or actor,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.880]   as a writer or dancer or a pastor?
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.680]   Are you dreaming of getting into a good university
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.960]   here in Hong Kong, overseas?
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.120]   Does your dream have to do with God's plan for your life?
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.240]   Or is it mainly about your success?
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.720]   Is your dream self-centered or is it about other people,
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.020]   helping them to flourish?
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.760]   In your dream, do you get ahead
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.440]   by taking advantage of others,
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.000]   by putting other people down?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.600]   Or does your dream put you in partnership with others,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.560]   bringing out the best in them and in you?
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:09.340]   Does your dream require you to bend or break the rules,
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.920]   to dishonor the name of Christ?
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.440]   Is there anything about your dream
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.840]   that you are ashamed to talk about?
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.940]   We need great wisdom and clear discernment
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.780]   and dreams need to be tested.
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.740]   These days, I'm part of a men's community group
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.020]   that is wrestling with the challenge of dreaming again.
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.720]   Each week, we talk about the sermon
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.660]   and also about a right now video by John Maxwell
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.160]   called "Put Your Dream to the Test."
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.140]   Now, Maxwell is helping us guys discern
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.160]   between wise and foolish dreams.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.260]   Is yours a daydream, just a distraction from your work?
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.380]   Is it pie in the sky, wild ideas with no strategy,
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.980]   no basis in reality?
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.660]   Maybe yours is a bad dream.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.660]   It breeds fear and paralysis.
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.100]   Or an idealistic dream.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.720]   This is the way the world would be
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.440]   if I were in charge of the world.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:21.580]   Vicarious dreams, dreams lived out through others.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.700]   Maybe yours is a romantic dream,
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.020]   the belief that some person is gonna make you happy
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:36.020]   or career dream, career success will make me happy.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.740]   A destination dream that maybe some position, title, award
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.020]   will make me happy.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:49.020]   Material dreams that wealth and possessions
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.500]   will make you happy.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:56.660]   Well, we need to seek wisdom and discernment.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:02.180]   We need to test our dreams with our community group,
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.780]   with others who know us well,
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.740]   who are willing to ask us hard questions,
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:13.740]   to pray with us, to help us discern a wise way
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.360]   to achieve our dreams.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.860]   Also, we need to look for God's wisdom
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.860]   and Jesus, the Bible tells us, is the wisdom of God.
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:33.260]   Now, what exactly does that mean for our dreams?
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.740]   Paul tells us that Christ's crucifixion,
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.160]   which proved to the Jews that Jesus could definitely
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.060]   not be God's Messiah, and which the Greeks dismissed
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.260]   as something totally absurd, the cross, Paul says,
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.700]   is actually a demonstration of the power of God
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.400]   and the wisdom of God.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.020]   For, Paul says, the foolishness of God
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.940]   is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.700]   is stronger than human strength.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:09.820]   To have God's wisdom as we dream means having the cross
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:16.020]   of Christ at the very center of our dreams.
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:21.280]   Am I willing to dream in the shadow of the cross?
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.080]   Am I willing to lay down my selfish desires
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.660]   and take up the cross to put God's kingdom,
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.940]   the wisdom and values of Jesus, front and center
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.040]   in my dream?
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:41.280]   In his dream as a teenager, Solomon made the right choices,
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.140]   but spoiler alert, he didn't always do that
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.660]   for the rest of his life.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:52.640]   So, how did God respond to Solomon's choice?
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.260]   The Lord was pleased that Solomon asked for this,
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.540]   for wisdom, discernment, so God said to him,
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.740]   "Since you have asked for this, and not for long life
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.920]   "or wealth for yourself, nor you've asked for the death
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.480]   "of your enemies, but for discernment
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.200]   "and administering justice, I will do what you have asked.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.700]   "I will give you a wise and discerning heart
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.060]   "so that there'll never be anyone like you,
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.380]   "nor ever again.
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.600]   "Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for,
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.600]   "both wealth and honor, so that in your lifetime,
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   "you'll have no equal.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.200]   "And if you walk in obedience to me
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.100]   "and keep my decrees and commands as David, your father did,
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.880]   "I'll give you a long life."
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.880]   Then Solomon awoke and he realized it was just a dream.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:55.200]   But God did give Solomon a wise and discerning heart.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.700]   Solomon is remembered as a wise king who wrote
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.220]   or compiled more than 3,000 proverbs
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.740]   and composed more than 1,000 songs,
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.520]   some of which are in the Hebrew Bible, our Old Testament.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.880]   People came from all around the region
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.120]   to hear from Solomon.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.120]   And God gave Solomon the wealth and honor
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.160]   he did not ask for.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.040]   Solomon expanded the kingdom his father David
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.320]   had established.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.320]   He built a magnificent temple to worship one God.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.500]   Solomon's reputation spread into Africa.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.720]   And he was visited by the queen of Ethiopia,
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.440]   who is believed to have taken the worship of God
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.040]   back to her home country.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.120]   A vibrant worship tradition that continues
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.020]   to this day in Ethiopia.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:47.380]   As was the custom for kings at the time,
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.520]   Solomon had many wives.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.720]   And here the story gets a little complicated.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.360]   Remember that in the dream, God had a condition
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.080]   for the blessings he would give Solomon.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.520]   If, if you walk,
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:09.520]   if you walk in obedience to me and keep my commands,
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.460]   that's the big if.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.880]   The problem is Solomon didn't always
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.400]   remember that condition.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.860]   Solomon's marriages were to women from royal families
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.340]   in the various kingdoms in the region.
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.600]   Marriages like this were part of foreign relations
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.680]   at the time, a way to secure peace and prosperity.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.860]   These women were, we might say ambassadors.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.920]   But here Solomon gradually lost his way.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.040]   He, he cared so much for these wives
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.180]   and the fame and influence that they brought him,
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.640]   that he provided temples in Jerusalem
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.520]   for them to worship their own gods.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.480]   A temple, temple's not too far from God's temple.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.700]   And Solomon's heart gradually drifted away
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.160]   from the God of Israel.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:11.160]   He, he was seduced by his love for his many wives
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.500]   to join them in worshiping idols.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.220]   He did not stay true to God
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.260]   as he was challenged in the dream.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.120]   And consequently, after his death,
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.620]   the kingdom became divided.
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.240]   It was never again united.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.540]   Eventually the kingdom was completely destroyed.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:34.540]   Sad, sad, so very sad.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:39.180]   Solomon began well as a teenaged king,
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.140]   but he did not end well.
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.220]   Instead of becoming wiser,
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.060]   he gradually became more selfish and decadent.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.420]   His success went to his head.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.680]   He began to believe in his own wisdom
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.220]   rather than trusting God's wisdom.
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.380]   And he made foolish, tragic decisions.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.180]   He ended his reign with great wealth and fame,
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.580]   but in spiritual disgrace.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.280]   Solomon received wisdom and discernment as a gift of God
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.920]   when he began his reign as a king.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.560]   But why did he lose that wisdom?
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.560]   How could he build such a marvelous temple
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.560]   and then begin worshiping other gods?
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.600]   What happened to his wisdom and his discernment?
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.700]   Well, there's a lesson here for us as we dream again
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.300]   and as we follow our dreams.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:45.160]   Allow God to shape your dream,
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.300]   not only at the beginning,
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.300]   but follow him very carefully as you live out your dream.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:58.320]   Don't allow your dream to be clouded by selfish ambition.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.960]   Don't allow success to corrupt you.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.640]   Don't let your success cause you to believe
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.960]   that you have made it on your own,
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.360]   that you don't really need God anymore.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   As you dream, don't succumb to the temptation to play God.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.480]   But this is not easy.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.180]   How to be a journalist in the new Hong Kong,
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:31.000]   to be wise as a snake, but harmless as a dove.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.860]   How to raise children with Jesus values
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.600]   when schools teach something different.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.960]   How to honor God as I manage the financial
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.400]   and other material resources God has entrusted to me.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.540]   How to be a disciple of Jesus in a culture
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:55.540]   that focuses on pleasure and immediate gratification.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:00.120]   How to grow in God's wisdom as I get higher education,
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.760]   more advanced degrees.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.760]   How to integrate the knowledge and expertise of science
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.360]   with the wisdom of God.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:17.320]   And how to avoid the tragedy of Solomon.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.120]   To have the wisdom and discernment to stay the course.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.520]   To be true to God and his dream for our lives
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.400]   month after month, year after year.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.760]   I used to fly a small plane.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:38.680]   I depended on three forms of wisdom or guidance
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.240]   to keep me on course throughout my journey.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.680]   A map that showed the area I was flying over,
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.440]   including mountains and other obstacles.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.880]   I needed secondly, a compass and an altimeter
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.880]   that showed me direction and altitude.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.460]   And then I had a radio that allowed me to communicate
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.480]   with air traffic controllers, a community of experts
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.880]   who could see all the planes in the air around me.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.600]   With these three points of reference,
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.080]   I could be sure of reaching my destination safely.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.720]   I like to think of the map as the Bible.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.320]   The compass and altimeter is God's spirit
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.780]   and air traffic control as the church.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:32.040]   For true wisdom and clear discernment, we need all three.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.260]   We need the word of God, the spirit of God,
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.300]   the people of God.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:41.300]   The word of God, bathe your mind and heart in scripture
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:47.520]   and find a new way to do it when you get bored.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.440]   This past year, I was listening my way through the Bible
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.120]   with Nikki Gumbel and David Suchet.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.040]   The Bible in one year app.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.080]   For you, it will be something different.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   The word of God, remember is sharp as a surgeon's scalpel,
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.840]   cutting through everything, whether doubt or defense,
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.420]   laying us open to listen and obey.
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.160]   That's Hebrews 4.12.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:18.200]   We need not only the word of God, we need the spirit of God.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.640]   Being in constant touch with God's spirit
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.720]   will help you grow through your experience.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   Become a practical scientist, learn from your experience.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.420]   So you don't keep making the same mistakes
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.100]   over and over again.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.380]   Believe me, I've been there, done that.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.880]   Like they say, insanity is doing the same thing
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.540]   over and over and expecting different results.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   And thirdly, we not only keep in touch with the spirit,
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.760]   but we also need to be in touch with the people of God.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.600]   Join a community group if you're not already a part.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.120]   Find a mentor, a spiritual friend,
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   someone you can be open and honest with
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:11.120]   who will both love and challenge you to grow.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.640]   Do you have a soul friend who knows you inside out?
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:23.680]   Reach out to us at the Vine, we'll help you find a fit.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.000]   So keep tuned to the word of God, the spirit of God,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.360]   the people of God.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.280]   If you do, you will have the wisdom and discernment
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   both to dream and to carry out your dream,
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.040]   to bring it to completion.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.080]   As for Chris and me, you probably guessed
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.400]   that we did pursue God's dream for us in China.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.160]   After a lot of prayer and counsel from friends
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.120]   and family members, we went to live and work in Shanghai
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.120]   for quite a few years before God brought us back to Hong Kong
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.800]   where we started our marriage 34 years before.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.840]   Did we always make wise decisions along the way?
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.120]   No, we didn't always get it right.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.540]   We sometimes stumbled and fell.
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.780]   We had many opportunities to grow through our mistakes,
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.220]   to fail forward as the saying goes.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.280]   But we have continued to follow Jesus
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.000]   and to pursue God's dream for our lives,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.200]   our careers and our marriage.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   And now along with you, we are dreaming again.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.040]   I like this children's song.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.960]   ♪ I am a promise ♪
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.120]   ♪ I am a possibility ♪
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.840]   ♪ I am a promise with a capital P ♪
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.840]   ♪ I am a great big bundle of potentiality ♪
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.560]   ♪ And I am learning to hear God's voice ♪
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.800]   ♪ And I am trying to make the right choice ♪
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   ♪ I am a promise to be anything God wants me to be ♪
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:16.780]   Not anything I want to be,
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.320]   not anything others want me to be,
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:25.860]   anything God wants me to be.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.080]   It's what God wants me to be
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.080]   that will give clarity, wisdom and perseverance
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.300]   to my dream.
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:43.440]   So we need wisdom and discernment
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.720]   to make the right choices day after day,
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.240]   month after month, year after year.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.760]   And if we lack wisdom, we can ask God
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   who gives to us generously without finding fault, James 1:5.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:05.720]   I love the way Paul describes our dreaming
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.240]   in alignment with the wisdom of God.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:14.060]   This resurrection life you receive from God
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.640]   is not a timid, grave-tending life.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.980]   It's adventurously expectant,
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:25.400]   greeting God with a child like, "What's next, Papa?"
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.760]   God's spirit touches our spirits
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.600]   and confirms who we really are.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.320]   We know who he is and we know who we are,
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.300]   father and children.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.800]   And we know we're going to get what's coming to us,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.840]   an unbelievable inheritance.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.080]   That's what it means to dream again
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.700]   with the wisdom and discernment of God's spirit.
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.700]   We discover our unbelievable inheritance with God.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.620]   So what's next, Papa?
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:09.060]   Right now, I invite you to lift up your dreams
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.460]   to Father God as we pray.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.940]   Would you do that?
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:19.940]   Would you lift up your dreams to our Father?
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:25.980]   Thank you, Abba, Papa,
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.740]   for helping us to dream again,
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.180]   for helping us to connect with the unbelievable inheritance
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.540]   you have for us, your children.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:40.300]   Thank you, Jesus, for your wisdom come into our world.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:44.600]   Help us as we dream again
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.620]   to discern and choose what is best
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:53.100]   so we grow up in every way to Christ and his wisdom.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:58.420]   Help us become big people who love you passionately
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.060]   and love our neighbors as ourselves
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.200]   and help us to become expressions of your wisdom
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.660]   in our homes, our schools, our offices,
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.460]   in our work and in our play,
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.180]   in our art and in our science,
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:17.020]   in our worship and also in our politics.
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:22.020]   Fill our dreams with the joy of your spirit's presence,
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:27.500]   with the hope of your unbelievable inheritance,
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.060]   with the healing that will sustain us
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.940]   through this pandemic.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:39.820]   In the name and wisdom of Jesus,
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:44.820]   we dream and we pray.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.380]   Amen.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.960]   (gentle music)
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.540]   (gentle music)
