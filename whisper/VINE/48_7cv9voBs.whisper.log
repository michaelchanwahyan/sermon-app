[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   Father, we're just so grateful.
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.040]   We're grateful that you are front and center,
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.160]   that in the challenging seasons of life
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.520]   that we have one who is alongside us,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.520]   equipping us, supporting us, loving us.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.840]   We're thankful that you've planted us
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.360]   in a community of faith.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.360]   And Lord, I wanna pray for a releasing of faith
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.640]   right now in the name of Jesus.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.040]   Lord, I wanna pray that as we pray for one another
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.880]   as a community, as we get more comfortable
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.120]   with the uncomfortable,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.360]   as we begin to expect that every time we step foot
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.080]   at a Vine service, something might be required of us,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.680]   as we have the mentality that when we come into service
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.760]   on a Sunday, we're coming in to serve.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.440]   Father, I wanna pray for the rising of faith
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440]   amongst your people.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.880]   I wanna pray that we would have such bold
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.360]   and courageous faith.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.280]   That Lord, we would believe that the things we're praying
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.520]   actually might happen.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.840]   That we would be like David and say,
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.880]   I am confident of this.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.760]   That as I pray for this person,
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.560]   the goodness of the Lord will be seen
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.600]   in their circumstance, in the situation,
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.840]   and whatever it is that they're grappling with.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.800]   Lord, it may not mean that every answer will come
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.280]   how we want it to come.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.120]   But it will mean that your goodness
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.520]   will be seen in our city.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.320]   Lord, we come into these moments
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.840]   not just on behalf of one another,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.200]   but on behalf of the city that you've blessed us with.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.680]   On behalf of Hong Kong that you have planted us in.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.280]   And Lord, as we open up what it is
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.000]   that's on your heart for the Vine
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.440]   in this season this year here on Vision Sunday.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.160]   Lord, I pray that you would stir faith.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.040]   And I wanna pray, Lord, that you would challenge us
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.320]   and make things uncomfortable.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.080]   It's okay, Lord, for you to do whatever you can do.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.400]   And Lord, as you stir and shake things up,
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.200]   Lord, would you make your church obedient.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.760]   Obedient to the glory of God that is seen in this moment
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.480]   and the glory of God that envelops our city.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.840]   And the glory of God that is found in this world.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.440]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.480]   Everyone says.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.280]   Amen.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.360]   (congregation applauding)
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.880]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.320]   So last year,
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.800]   about probably, I would say about halfway through
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.560]   the 850 kilometer walk that I was doing
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.880]   through the north of Spain during my sabbatical,
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.720]   the Camino de Santiago,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.720]   literally about halfway through that walk, my phone died.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.960]   This actual phone, this very, very phone died on me.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.880]   And when I say died, I'm not just saying
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.120]   like the battery ran out and like it lost reception
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.280]   or something, I mean like total death without resurrection.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.880]   My phone went to hell.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.920]   It is totally and totally gone.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   I got the black screen of death, never to revive itself.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.480]   I mean, I tried everything I could to get it
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.800]   to come back to life, but it was completely
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.000]   and utterly dead.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.560]   Now, that was an issue for many reasons.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.840]   It was an issue because this was how I was connecting
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.680]   with my wife and my daughter every day.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.440]   I was gonna be away for about five weeks
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.120]   as I did the Camino, and this was my ability
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.360]   to stay in touch with my family.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.720]   I was off social media at the time,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.000]   but this was my ability to stay in touch with the world.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.200]   So through the news and at night when I would watch YouTube,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.560]   very important.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.520]   This was the connection point for my journaling.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.240]   And anytime God spoke to me,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.720]   I would use my phone and write it down.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.600]   It was, I was writing a book, I'm still writing a book.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.840]   I've been writing a book for 10 years.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.040]   I was still writing my book on this,
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.440]   and every night on the Camino, I would try to write
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.880]   a couple of paragraphs of my book all on my phone.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.400]   So when it died, that was a big issue.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.320]   But the biggest issue was that I was using this phone
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.760]   every single day and pretty much almost all day
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.560]   to navigate the route that I needed to take
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.960]   on the Camino itself.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.760]   So every single day, I would use this as the map.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.040]   And all of us who were pilgrims on the Camino,
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.120]   this is what we had.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.280]   We didn't have a paper map, we had our phones.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.640]   And in these days, there's a specific Google map
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.920]   that you can download that has the Camino trail on it.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.080]   It has all the villages you're gonna go through.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.160]   It has all the hostels that you can stay at.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.040]   And there's literally like a blue dot
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.280]   where you are on the Camino every time.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.080]   And so it's impossible to get lost.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.920]   You just open up the map on your phone,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.680]   you follow the blue dot, you follow the line
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.080]   that you're on and you're great.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.120]   They have occasionally yellow markings,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.960]   yellow arrows painted on the side of buildings and stuff
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.080]   just in case, but they are kind of few and far between.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.240]   You've got this map on your phone and that's what helps you.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.920]   So here I am in the middle of this day.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.160]   I'm in the middle of nowhere in Spain.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.960]   I don't speak the language.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.680]   I'm struggling to understand the culture.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.400]   And no one is around me.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.200]   But all I have is my trusty phone and the map.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.120]   And I know I'm on the right path.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.880]   And as I'm walking that day, it dies.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.880]   And it goes, like immediately gone.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.560]   Now, here was the thing I was kind of freaking out about.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.680]   I was like, well, oh my goodness, what am I gonna do?
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.800]   Because like I can't navigate now.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.400]   There's no one around me.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.720]   I was in the middle of nowhere.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.600]   There was no village that I could see.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.320]   Sometimes the villages were like our little kind of stop point
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.440]   where you kind of know that if you get to that village,
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.400]   you're on the right path.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.520]   Well, there's no village, there's no map,
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.400]   there's no nothing, there's no pilgrims.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.480]   I remember thinking, okay, well, I did look ahead a little bit.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.000]   And I know I had to turn right.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.960]   And I know there was a bit around to the left.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.840]   And so I'm like, well, I'll just try to use my memory a little bit.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.160]   Maybe things will be okay.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.440]   So I start walking and start trusting in my memory.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.920]   After I've made like two right turns and a left turn and another right turn,
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.840]   I realized that my memory has finished.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.320]   I can memorize a sermon word for word, but I cannot memorize a map.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.680]   So my memory completely failed.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.840]   And I had no memory now of where I needed to go.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.800]   Still no one else around me.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.440]   And so I began to pray, 'cause that's what you're gonna do.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.400]   And I began to say, Jesus, oh, Jesus, if you could just help me here,
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.600]   I'm in the middle of nowhere.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.800]   I don't know where to go.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.320]   I don't know where the next village is.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.160]   I don't know.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.640]   I'm just gonna have to trust you, Lord.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.120]   And I started to pray and I started to pray
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.040]   and I started to walk and pray, walk and pray.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.520]   I'm like, God, if I'm not supposed to go right, shut the door.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.120]   And I would go right, but the door would still be open
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.400]   and I'd keep going right.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   After about an hour, I've not come up to any village.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.840]   I've not seen any other pilgrims,
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.760]   but I'm trusting in the Jesus and the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.120]   So I walk another half hour, an hour and a half,
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.520]   no village, no pilgrims.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.240]   My trust of Jesus is beginning to waver a little bit at this point.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.560]   I'm beginning to wonder whether I am actually on the right path.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.960]   It feels like I'm horrendously lost.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.560]   And suddenly I have this thought.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.880]   I wonder if anyone else has felt this way.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.880]   When you're in a situation where you've been trying on your own
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.840]   and it seems like all the doors are shut.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.800]   I had this thought, maybe I should go back.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.520]   Maybe if I just turn around and go back to where I started,
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.480]   if I walk an hour and a half back in the other direction
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.840]   and try to retrace my steps as much as possible,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.240]   I will be at the place where my phone died
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.360]   because at least then I knew I was on the path.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.120]   So I'm literally, I have walked for an hour and a half,
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.480]   I've decided, yes, I'm going to turn around.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.680]   I turn around and start walking back where I had come.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.080]   As soon as I start walking back from where I'd come,
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.680]   I notice on the horizon, somebody with a backpack.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.680]   Another pilgrim.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.360]   Two thoughts went straight through my head.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.840]   Number one, maybe their phone has died too.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.320]   And maybe they're lost as well.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.080]   Or maybe their phone's working and they're on the path
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.880]   and I'm not lost after all.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.680]   And so I'm starting to walk really fast.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.960]   I'm almost like running towards them.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.760]   There, it was this German lady, hadn't met her before.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.040]   She's kind of wondering why this pilgrim is running at her.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.160]   As I get kind of close to her, she goes,
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.760]   "Why are you going in the wrong direction?"
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.840]   And I'm like, "Because my phone's broken."
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.840]   And I got my phone out.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.920]   I'm like, "Look, it's dead."
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.000]   And she then pulls her phone out, which is working.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.360]   And she goes, "Well, we're actually on the right path."
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.520]   She's like, "You're fine.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.440]   "Everything's gonna be fine."
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.680]   In fact, and she just showed me,
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.880]   like up just up over there, a little bit left to the right,
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.040]   up over that hill over there,
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.680]   there's the village that you wanna come to.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.640]   And when you get to that village,
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.120]   there'll be some food and some water.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.080]   And I was like, "Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus,
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.440]   "for this German lady."
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.080]   And for the reality that I know
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.360]   that I'm now on the right path.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.000]   Well, I get to the village and I put my backpack down
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.120]   and I have a really nice lunch
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.280]   and I'm feeling a lot more healthy
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.680]   and a lot more kind of sane.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.440]   And I get map from the lady.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.920]   She was gonna go off and walk on her own,
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.200]   but she gave me a written down kind of map
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.280]   of where I needed to go.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.960]   And I had it on a piece of paper
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.120]   and I felt confident again.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.400]   And I managed to get to the village eventually
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.720]   where I was gonna stay that night.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.200]   And I managed to unpack my backpack
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.360]   and have a shower at the hostel I was staying in.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.400]   Then straight after that, I began to just sit.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.560]   And as soon as I sat,
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.880]   you know like sometimes you've got like so much activity
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.280]   going in your life that God can't speak to you.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.680]   Anyone else been like, is it just me?
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.560]   Maybe it's just me.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.880]   Sometimes we're like so busy, right?
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.040]   We're still doing stuff.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.120]   And it's only when we finally sit down
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.960]   that God's like, great, now I can speak.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.960]   And I kind of sat down and God began to speak.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.120]   And God began to speak to me in a very strong way,
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.600]   in a very, it was a very kind of Holy Spirit.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.440]   And I knew kind of like he was beginning
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.040]   to say some pretty serious things.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.800]   And I went to my pocket to get my phone out
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.280]   so I could journal what he was saying
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.480]   and realize of course my phone's dead.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.560]   So I grabbed a piece of paper
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.960]   and I began to write down what he said.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.520]   In fact, I grabbed this piece of paper right here.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.360]   This is the very piece of paper that I had.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.200]   And before I show you what I wrote,
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.620]   you might remember during my sabbatical,
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.040]   I had gone into my sabbatical asking God to speak to me
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.280]   about the vine and about us and our future
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.200]   and what God wants to do
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.200]   and what God wants to do to me in the future and all that.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.960]   And God hadn't spoken to me at all
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.000]   throughout my whole sabbatical
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.840]   and that's all about the vine.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.160]   In fact, he'd spoken to me about all these other things
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.680]   which were for him much more important for me
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.040]   in that moment of my life.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.560]   But in this moment, as soon as I sat down,
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.000]   as he started to speak and the Holy Spirit came on me,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.440]   I knew he was speaking to me about us, about the vine.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.160]   And it's the only time on the whole of my sabbatical
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.000]   where he downloaded something specifically for us.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.280]   And I wanna read to you what I wrote down.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.480]   I wrote this.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.480]   He said, "I'm about to move the vine
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.260]   "into uncharted territory.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.560]   "I desire to take you places that you have never been,
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.780]   "to stretch you beyond
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.800]   "what you are currently comfortable with.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   "These uncharted territories are necessary
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.040]   "for your faith and my work.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.460]   "You do not have the strategy, resources,
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.340]   "gifts or wisdom for what is coming,
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.220]   "but this is not an issue.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.840]   "All you need to begin is faith and courage.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.500]   "This is about complete trust in me.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.120]   "What I will give you though is a burden.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.000]   "I will give you a new heart.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.920]   "I will make you unsatisfied for the here and now.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.600]   "I will place my hand upon you
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   "and stir up the joy of the pursuit of me."
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.400]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.400]   I wanna read that.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:41.760]   Sorry.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.080]   "I wanna place my hand upon you
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.840]   "and stir up the joy of the pursuit of me."
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.680]   Hands up if you want the joy of pursuing Jesus.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.940]   Oh, come on, Lord.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.980]   "I'm not calling you to a vision
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.380]   "with knowledge of all that is ahead.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.100]   "No, this is uncharted territory.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.820]   "What I am calling you is to a value,
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.900]   "the value of complete and total surrender,
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.300]   "a holy dissatisfaction in the way things have been
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.940]   "and a passionate longing for the discovery of more."
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.420]   I then wrote at the bottom,
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.140]   "Need to preach this sometime."
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.180]   That's what I'm gonna do now.
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.700]   As God was downloading this to me,
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.380]   it was very emotional at that time and very full,
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.020]   and I felt the Spirit of God so strongly,
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.740]   I immediately began to see a picture in my mind,
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.160]   not a vision with my eyes awake,
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.460]   but just a picture in my mind as I started to reflect
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.220]   and to soak in this Word that God had given.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.100]   And it was a picture of one of those ancient kind of boats
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.440]   that were used by the early settlers, the early pioneers,
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.340]   the ones that were going out
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.520]   towards the discovery of new lands.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.100]   I could see in my mind's eye this beautiful ship.
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.980]   And the ship was in harbor, in kind of safe harbor,
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.780]   but the ship was filled with people
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.300]   who were beginning to get ready
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.940]   for the journey that was ahead.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.580]   And there were all these sailors on the ship
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.860]   and they were all doing their own individual tasks
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.120]   to prepare the boat for it getting ready.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.220]   The boat begins to move as the people begin to navigate
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.020]   out of the safe harbor and out into the waters.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.420]   And at the bow of the boat, in my mind's eye,
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.380]   I could see the captain of the boat.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.820]   And he's standing at the front there with like a telescope
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.940]   and he's leaning forward
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.540]   and he's looking out into the waters ahead.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.940]   And the sense was that everybody on this boat
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.420]   was excited and nervous at the same time.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.620]   They were excited because they were about to go
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.220]   on this great adventure.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.180]   They were about to be launched out
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.500]   and they were wondering what might be out there.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.620]   And they had prepared themselves for this.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.780]   And they all had their own little part to play.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.500]   And as they did their own little part,
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.260]   the boat could move out into what was unknown,
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.820]   but they were nervous
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.940]   because they didn't know what was out there.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.640]   They didn't know what was beyond.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.820]   This was uncharted territory.
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.540]   It was uncharted waters.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.100]   No one had been there before.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.180]   They didn't have a map.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.180]   The map was not existing to enable them to navigate
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.620]   the place where they were going.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.580]   So the captain's leaning forward with his telescope
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.820]   and he's thinking to himself,
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.900]   well, either there's endless amounts of sea out there
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.140]   or we're gonna come across some land, but we have no idea.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:24.300]   What we do have is an undeniable hope.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.700]   We have an undeniable burden inside of us
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.580]   that there is something out there to be discovered.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.940]   And not only that, but we have this unrivaled passion,
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.580]   unrivaled passion that although we're afraid
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.340]   and although we don't have the answers
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.100]   and although it's a little uncomfortable
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.100]   and we might go out there and fail,
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.260]   we might go out there and discover nothing,
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.620]   but we're going to go and see what's there
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.420]   'cause I cannot deny the burden that is inside of me,
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.060]   the undeniable hope that is driving me
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.220]   and the unrivaled passion that is moving me.
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:02.980]   And this picture so resonated with me
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.340]   because I could get a sense that this is what God
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.780]   is calling the vine into in this season
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.420]   that we're now moving into,
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.380]   that this is our uncharted territory time.
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.140]   This is our time where we are going to be
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.060]   in uncharted waters.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.500]   We've talked to you on Vision Sunday
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.860]   over the last number of years about the river model
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.980]   that we have here at the vine.
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.820]   The river model being this idea that church
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.180]   is not 90 minutes on a Sunday,
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.620]   it's not people in a building,
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.140]   the church is like a river flowing in its city.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.100]   We, the people of Christ, actively engaged
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.460]   in our sphere of influence.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.980]   We've been saying at the beginning of this year,
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.100]   this is a year for action,
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.100]   that we are to take our faith and live it more publicly.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.420]   So I'm standing here before you today on Vision Sunday,
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.180]   and I'm saying, here's the thing that God is really saying,
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.420]   in a year of action,
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.780]   in wanting us to live our faith more publicly,
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.420]   it's going to be uncharted.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.500]   There's not going to be a map.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.100]   We don't have the strategy, the resources,
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.940]   the wisdom to be able to conquer what is ahead.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.940]   In fact, God has so designed it that our phone has died.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:12.060]   He doesn't want us to be relying on the old things
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.660]   that we've always relied on.
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.620]   No, you see, when God moves a church or a people
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.540]   into an uncharted time,
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.820]   it's specifically to get them to focus
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.740]   off of what they were relying on that wasn't Him,
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.220]   and begin to focus directly on Him.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.460]   Like me in that Camino going, Jesus, I need you now,
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.900]   'cause I have nothing else.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.020]   We believe that God is moving the vine now into a time
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.780]   where we collectively, as God's people,
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.100]   are gonna have to say, Lord, if you don't show up,
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.700]   we have no idea where to go.
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.300]   And we're gonna be in a season
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.860]   where God is going to do some things
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.580]   that we have never experienced before.
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.860]   I believe we're gonna see this in an outpouring
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.660]   of His Spirit here on Sundays,
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.620]   but I believe we're also gonna see it happening
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.380]   in our cities, in the corridors of power.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.260]   We're gonna see it in the marketplace.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.460]   We're gonna see it in the educational institutions
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.300]   around us.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.860]   We're gonna see God do some things
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.980]   that we don't have a map currently for.
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.660]   And the temptation for us is to try to go back
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.300]   to what we've done in the past,
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.460]   to try to give us some stability
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.140]   when we're in an uncomfortable, uncharted time.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.780]   And instead, God is saying,
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.580]   remember the captain on the boat.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.460]   What I want you to do is to be leaning forward in the bow,
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.060]   and yes, it can be uncomfortable,
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.580]   and yes, it's gonna be challenging,
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.820]   but I want you to look forward,
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.660]   for I have put an undeniable hope in you
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.620]   for the gospel for your city.
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.340]   I love this, because when God speaks to us
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.980]   as a church about the season we're in,
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.420]   it's not just about us corporately,
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.980]   it's also about you individually.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.340]   And if this is your home church in Hong Kong,
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.700]   you would say, I'm a Viner.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.660]   I go to the Vine every week, or every other week,
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.380]   or maybe once every 10 months.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.540]   But if you say, this is my church, I'm a Viner,
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.980]   this is my community,
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.780]   then this is not just something for us as a total church.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.100]   'Cause you could sit there throughout this whole talk today
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.060]   and go like, oh wow, God's calling the Vine to be uncharted.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.980]   Well, I'll look forward to each Sunday then,
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.660]   and you'll miss the point.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.580]   Actually, what God's saying is,
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.580]   I'm calling you to be uncharted.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.300]   I'm calling you into a season
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.780]   where you're not gonna have the strategy,
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.140]   gifts, wisdom, and resource to be able to survive.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.540]   I'm actually gonna be placing you in a time
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.420]   where you're gonna feel a little bit out of your depth,
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.460]   a little bit overwhelmed,
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.260]   where the things that you've relied on before
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.580]   are no longer gonna be the things that you can rely on now.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.900]   And I'm gonna do some things in your life
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.620]   and around your life where you're gonna be like,
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.380]   I can't believe the Holy Spirit is doing that.
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.220]   You're gonna see fruit and abundance
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.860]   like you have never seen it before.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.820]   But there is no current map.
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.740]   The phone has died, and the phone has died
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.460]   because I'm shaking you out of a sense of complacency.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.780]   I'm shaking you out of how some of that dust
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.140]   has settled on you, and I'm forcing you, if you will.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.740]   I'm bringing you, I'm inviting you back to trust in me.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:10.460]   This is a, it's not an easy thing,
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.860]   I think he's calling us to.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.420]   But let me give you some ideas
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.380]   of what I think this season's going to be like.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.660]   You see, I think like the settlers on the boat
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.500]   who are both excited and nervous
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.620]   and pushing out from harbor out to what they don't know.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.020]   This is gonna be a season of discovery and adventure
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.780]   focused on the unknown but anticipated.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.420]   Let me unpack that for you for a moment.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.900]   The unknown but anticipated.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.980]   It's unknown because that's the very definition
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.060]   of an uncharted season.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.060]   We don't know what's ahead.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.620]   And we know that God is saying
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.860]   that there isn't a current strategy we have
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.820]   that's gonna help us in what's ahead.
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.660]   This was amazing.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.820]   When I was sitting there in Spain
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.100]   and God was downloading this to me
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.180]   and I was writing this down on that piece of paper,
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.980]   I remember thinking to myself, this is awesome
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.420]   because I'm the senior pastor here,
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.420]   I'm supposed to lead here,
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.740]   and one of my responsibilities
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.820]   is always to have strategy for you.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.020]   And God was saying, I'm taking you to a place
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.900]   where you won't have a strategy.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.380]   And I was like, thank you, Lord.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.460]   So good.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.940]   'Cause I don't know how many years it's been
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.380]   and my wife would tell you if she was here,
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.620]   she would tell you that I have spent countless hours,
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.620]   sleepless nights, worrying and processing
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.140]   and praying and discerning and having strategies.
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.420]   And look, I'm not saying strategies are wrong and bad,
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.260]   they're not.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.340]   The vine has been blessed over so many years
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.780]   by the faithful stewardship of elders and pastors
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.860]   and senior pastors in past seasons.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.140]   And in my season as well,
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.100]   we've been faithful to discerning a strategy
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.500]   for how to grow this church,
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.300]   how to make sure the ministries are going well,
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.660]   how to serve our city.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.140]   Strategies are great.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.100]   But could you imagine the lift from me
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.300]   when the Lord said, I'm now moving into a place
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.180]   where you will not have a strategy.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.020]   That's uncomfortable, Andrew,
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.620]   but it's also a lifting of a burden from you
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.100]   because in that place,
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.620]   all you'll need to do is point people to me.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.380]   And that's what I'm basically standing before you today
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:09.220]   to do is to say, we don't have a new fresh vision
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.540]   and we don't have a list of things
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.500]   that the vine's gonna do in the next 12 months.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.740]   All I'm saying to you is we are in uncharted times.
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.740]   We have been pushed out of the boat.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.500]   We are out of our comfort zone.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.580]   And God is saying in that place,
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.260]   you are gonna see me do more
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.420]   than you have ever seen me do before.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.140]   This is a time where it will be unknown for you.
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.380]   But notice what he says, but anticipated.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.220]   I love this.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.940]   In other words, just because it's unknown
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.460]   doesn't mean we should be passive towards it.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.620]   Follow this church 'cause this is really important.
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.420]   You could think that in a season of unchartedness
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.260]   where we don't have a map and we don't have a strategy
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.260]   and we must rely on Jesus, that's all about Jesus.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.060]   It's all about him doing it and not about us.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.540]   And so we could adopt a passiveness
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.140]   towards what God is saying.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.020]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.980]   He's saying, I want you in the bow of the boat.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.980]   I want you with that telescope looking out in hope,
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.500]   that undeniable hope for the land that's ahead.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.260]   I want you leaning into what I'm doing.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.460]   I want you to realize it's unknown,
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.060]   but it doesn't mean you can't anticipate it.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.180]   It doesn't mean you can't believe that I'm gonna act.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.020]   It doesn't mean that you can't believe and trust
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.100]   that if you push yourself out there, I will be there.
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.140]   It doesn't mean that you can't begin to believe
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.700]   and pray and hope for revival and refreshment
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.700]   and renewal in the city.
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.300]   It'll be unknown for you,
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.700]   but it is something you can anticipate.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.540]   It makes sense to you.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.300]   So it's gonna be this kind of season.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.660]   Here's secondly what I think it is.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.740]   A little bit like me on the Camino and my phone died
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:46.020]   and I needed to find other ways to navigate.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.900]   This is going to be a season,
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.100]   a season where we're gonna have to have wholehearted trust
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:56.540]   and reliance in Jesus above and beyond anything else.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.580]   What you gotta understand is that an uncharted season to us
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.900]   is not an uncharted season to Jesus.
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.380]   He knows everything that's ahead.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.180]   He knows there's no land in this world
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.300]   that he's not explored.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.540]   There's no land in this world
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.780]   that he's not king and sovereign over.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.980]   And although it is uncharted for us,
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.180]   although we've never been there, he has been there.
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.220]   Not only has he been there, he is there.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.140]   Not only is he there, he's sovereign over that place.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.660]   So our unchartedness is something that he is sovereign over.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.540]   And so what we need to do is shift away
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.660]   from the other things we've been relying on
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.660]   and put our full trust in him.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:39.140]   Let me put it this way.
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.500]   You have not been saved by Jesus Christ
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.900]   to be a map follower.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.780]   You've been saved by Jesus to be a Christ follower.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.100]   Come on church, a Christ follower.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.220]   And that doesn't mean again that Christ doesn't help us
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.140]   and give us direction and give us guidance
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:54.980]   and all that sort of thing.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.820]   Of course he does.
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.260]   But our primary posture has to be to follow him,
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:03.140]   recognizing that sometimes we end up following other things
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.060]   thinking it's him.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.660]   We end up following the things that are comfortable for us
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.420]   or the things that we've relied on in the past
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.940]   or the strategies we've had before
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.580]   or the devotion that we did two years ago
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.500]   that was super helpful for us,
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.980]   but we haven't done a devotion for two years.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.700]   And we begin to think that if we just rely on the things
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.660]   that we've had before, we'll be fine.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.580]   And God is basically saying in a season of unchartedness,
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.060]   the whole point of it is that I'm bringing you
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.460]   to trust more in me.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.300]   That the old things need to be let go of
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.660]   and a fresh dedication to following me.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.460]   The phone has died, Vine.
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.140]   Come on church.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.100]   The phone is dead.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.900]   The very thing that we've been relying on,
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.260]   he's saying that's not gonna happen.
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.420]   There's no strategy, no resources, no gift, no wisdom.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.740]   But there is me.
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.060]   And as you stay tethered to me,
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.420]   sure, then the other things will flow.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.220]   The things you will need for this season, it will come.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.780]   But your primary posture in this time is me.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.700]   Which is the third point of a season like this.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.340]   A little bit like the men and women
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.820]   that you see in the Bible who have at times
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.780]   have to reexamine themselves and recommit themselves
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.380]   to the ways of God.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.340]   This will be a season where God's people
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:22.660]   will have to have intentional readiness.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.060]   Intentional readiness through God
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.820]   where we're prepared not with a plan of action,
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.940]   but a posture of heart.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:30.900]   Come on church.
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.740]   Not with a plan of action,
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.060]   'cause if God had showed up and said,
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.980]   okay, this is what I'm doing.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.900]   I'm taking you here, I'm gonna do all these things.
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.620]   We should have a plan of action for that.
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.620]   But when he says, you will not know
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.860]   what it is that I'm doing.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.740]   I am moving you out of your comfort zone
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.380]   into a place that you cannot predict,
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.900]   but I am going to do some things.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.940]   Our thing is not get a plan of action.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.620]   Our thing is let's make sure we're the people of God
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.740]   that we need to be so that when God does something
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.620]   that is uncharted, we respond.
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.020]   We react.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.100]   We follow.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.980]   We begin to do.
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.740]   We begin to work out the kingdom
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.060]   when we see the kingdom come.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.740]   And so this is a season, not a call to some strategic plan,
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.540]   it's a season of a call to actually reevaluate
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.220]   my heart, reevaluating my life,
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:21.500]   reevaluating the values that I hold inside of me,
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.780]   reevaluating the brokenness that's sitting within me,
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.780]   the recognition that sin so easily tangles.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.340]   I wanna be someone that when I'm in an uncharted season
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.380]   and God suddenly shows up and does something incredible,
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.620]   I'm like, God, use me.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:43.500]   And for that to happen, I can prepare myself for that.
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.180]   I may not know what it's going to be,
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.940]   but I wanna say yes when it happens.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.420]   And so there's this posture of the heart.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.740]   There's a readiness of the values of my life
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.140]   so that when God moves, I respond.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.820]   When God acts, I do.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.580]   When he says who's gonna go, I say send me.
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.700]   When he says the harvest is plentiful,
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.900]   but the workers are few, I will say I'm one of the few.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.820]   And I think this is the culture
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.740]   that he's wanting to now build at the vine
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.740]   in the season that we're now moving into.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:19.460]   He's intentionally shifted us into a hard, uncomfortable,
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.540]   not having it all worked out time
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.540]   so that he can rebirth within us a passion for him.
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.740]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:30.740]   That excites Emma.
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.060]   And it excites me.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.660]   And I know it excites you too.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.380]   And these values that we can have
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.140]   and posture for a season of being uncharted
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.260]   is what we're gonna be talking to you about
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.180]   over the next six weeks,
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.340]   starting next week and the weeks beyond it.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.180]   We're gonna actually break down one of the values each week.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.220]   And we're gonna do it by looking at the book of Acts
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.140]   and the beautiful story in Acts
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.140]   where the first disciples go to take the gospel
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.060]   in the Greek and Roman Empire.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.460]   I mean, talk about uncharted times
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.420]   and the values that the disciples had
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.620]   to enable them to react and respond when God moved.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.540]   So we're gonna unpack that in the weeks ahead.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.540]   Today though, I wanna land us on a specific value,
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.900]   a posture of heart that I think is the critical first step.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.180]   I think it's the thing that God is saying
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.700]   in a season of unchartedness,
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.020]   this is the first thing that I call of you.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.580]   And actually, when you look through the gospels,
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.060]   this was Jesus's first thing he called for everyone.
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.060]   When he said like, if you wanna follow me,
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.460]   he says, I want you to lay down your cross,
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.900]   lay down your life, pick up your cross and follow me.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.900]   He calls them to what I would describe as sacrificial risk.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.660]   And I think if we're being serious as a church
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.380]   about a season of being uncharted,
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.980]   we have to be serious about the reality
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.620]   that it's gonna require a tremendous amount
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.100]   of sacrifice and risk for us to let go
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.140]   of the things that we've been depending on
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.540]   and actually begin to look to Jesus again.
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.660]   We're gonna have to be all in,
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:02.220]   in a time when we are feeling completely out of control.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.780]   And in that, Jesus, to the crowds, to his disciples,
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.540]   is constantly teaching them about the ability
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.140]   to move all in for him,
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.380]   about giving up their lives to follow him.
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.100]   This is the crux of the gospel.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.220]   It's a death and a resurrection.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.900]   It's a giving in order to receiving.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.980]   It's Paul writing to the church in Corinth
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.660]   and saying, I'm willing to take the dying side
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.180]   so that the living side is seen in you.
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.780]   This is the beauty of the gospel,
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.700]   and Jesus doesn't sugarcoat it.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.060]   And he says, it's gonna require the giving of yourself,
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.580]   the death to yourself,
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.500]   the picking up the cross and following me.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.340]   Let me read to you just Matthew 13, beautiful chapter,
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.020]   eight parables in that chapter
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.620]   about Jesus speaking about the kingdom
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.020]   and what his reign on earth is gonna look like.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.340]   But he narrows in on this idea of risk
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.260]   and the giving of all in these beautiful two parables
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.620]   I wanna read to you from Matthew 13, starting in verse 44.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.100]   Is this okay so far?
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.580]   All right, listen to this.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.220]   The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.380]   When a man found it, he hid it again,
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.500]   and then in his joy went and sold all that he had
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.300]   and bought that field.
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.580]   Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.580]   looking for fine pearls.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.980]   When he found one of great value,
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.340]   he went away and sold everything he had and he brought it.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.300]   I love these two parables.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.100]   Jesus is bringing, and he does this often.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.300]   He's a master storyteller.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.460]   He brings two different worlds together
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.700]   in two contrasting but similar parables.
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.820]   In the first, he talks about a day laborer.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.380]   These were relatively poor people
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.660]   that kind of rented themselves out to the local farmers
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.260]   for each day of the year to basically farm their land.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.860]   And in this particular parable,
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.900]   he has this poor day laborer who's there with his hoe
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.020]   and he's kind of hoeing the ground, if you will,
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.500]   of the particular farm that he's farming that day,
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.940]   and suddenly he discovers a treasure.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.660]   Now, when we read the parable and we see this,
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.740]   we think, well, this is just like a weird story, right?
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.220]   This is just a fiction story.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.740]   But actually, this happened all the time
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.780]   in the first century.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:08.180]   The land in those years was so often attacked
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.660]   by foreign forces and there were no like HSBC deposit boxes,
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.460]   security boxes in those days.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.380]   So what people did, if they had valuables
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.420]   like jewelry or whatever, they would bury it often
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.420]   in one of their fields in the farm.
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.540]   And they wouldn't tell anybody where it was buried.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.980]   Or maybe they would tell one person,
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.020]   but most likely they would just keep it to themselves,
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.500]   but they would know exactly
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.460]   where they had buried this treasure.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.220]   Now, the problem is maybe a year or two later,
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.300]   they are conscripted into the war,
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.780]   they're killed on the battlefield,
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.460]   and they didn't tell anybody where the treasure was.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.620]   So suddenly there's this treasure hidden in a field
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.340]   that's gonna be hidden in that field for centuries
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.500]   until someone finds it.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.820]   And Jesus is picking up on this exact thing.
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.660]   And here's this day where this day laborer
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.180]   randomly stumbles across this incredible treasure
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.260]   in a field, and he understands
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.140]   that if he just pulls the treasure out,
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.180]   he can't claim it for himself.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.620]   Jewish law in those days was that anything above a field
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.700]   or below the field was part of the ownership
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.220]   of the one who owned the field, right?
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.780]   So the only way he could own that treasure
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.780]   was by buying the field,
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.420]   and then he could remove the treasure and take it.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.540]   And the parable pitches him doing exactly that.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.780]   But notice what it says.
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.780]   It says that he sells everything
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.140]   in order to buy that field.
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.140]   And notice this, it says he did it with joy.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.780]   Come on, church.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.980]   'Cause I know if it had been me
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.300]   and you had asked me to give a little bit,
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.820]   I would have been very joyful.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:40.580]   But you asked me to give it all, everything,
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.900]   and in joy he went, sold it all, and brought the field.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.900]   The second parable is a world completely removed
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.900]   from the first, but tells the same story.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.900]   In the second one, it's a little bit more like Hong Kong.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.340]   Here's a wealthy businessman.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.700]   He's good at what he does.
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.940]   He's a pearl merchant.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.500]   He travels probably in the Persian Sea,
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.780]   the Red Sea, the Indian Sea.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:02.540]   He probably works with pearl fishermen in those areas.
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.500]   And he's constantly on the lookout,
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.980]   a little bit like the captain on the front of the bow,
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.180]   looking for that one pearl that is the pearl,
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.100]   his holy grail, if you will.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.220]   And here on this day, he's been searching and looking,
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.060]   and finally he discovers that one pearl at great price.
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.340]   And what does he do?
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.700]   He then sells all of his other stock
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.220]   in order to buy that one pearl.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.020]   Now, this is incredible risk for both of these individuals.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.020]   And I want you to see something really important here.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.820]   Jesus is bringing a day laborer and a pearl,
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.180]   a wealthy merchant, together and saying,
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.860]   "This is not about whether you're poor
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:37.900]   "or whether you're rich.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.420]   "It doesn't matter about your social economic status.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.620]   "All people are required when it comes to the kingdom
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.500]   "to give it all."
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.260]   And so both of them give up everything
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.860]   in order to receive the one thing that is of great price.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.020]   And that was a risk.
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.420]   It was risky for the poor guy to do all that.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.900]   He didn't have a lot, but he gathered it all together.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.140]   He sold it to buy the field.
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.860]   It was risky for the businessman to give away everything
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.860]   or sell everything to buy the one.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.940]   There's this inherent, beautiful risk to it.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.560]   And Jesus is saying, "That's what my kingdom is like."
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.580]   When you see the value of the kingdom,
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.100]   you're willing to give it all.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.020]   You're willing to risk what you have
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.780]   for what you don't have.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.660]   You're willing to risk what you know
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.140]   for what you don't know.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.980]   You're willing to risk who you are
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.540]   for who you long to become.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.020]   And Jesus is saying, "This is what my kingdom is like.
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.380]   "This is what it's like when you are in uncharted territory.
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.660]   "You're willing to sell it all
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.380]   "so that the kingdom would be seen."
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.380]   I think there's so many things we could learn
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.200]   from these parables.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.220]   Let me just very briefly highlight a couple of things
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.100]   that I think are important.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.380]   The first is this.
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.540]   When you're in a season of uncharted waters,
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.820]   it's really important that in that season,
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.720]   you ground yourself in the reality
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.020]   that you need to both intentionally seek out
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.700]   the kingdom of God, but also be responsive
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.200]   to the unexpected activity of that kingdom.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.620]   You see, in these two parables, you see both at play.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.140]   In the first parable, the guy is just going about
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.100]   his normal day, his normal business,
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.100]   his mundane plowing the field.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.220]   He wasn't expecting to discover a treasure
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.580]   in that field that day, but when he does,
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:23.220]   he immediately is prepared through the posture of his heart
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.740]   to joyfully give it all for that.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.660]   And when we're in a season of unchartedness,
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.260]   what God is saying is, "I need you to prepare
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.100]   "your heart, church, because there are gonna be moments
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.600]   "ahead this year where I'm gonna randomly show up
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.600]   "in your everyday mundane life, or your everyday work life,
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.020]   "or your everyday family life, or your everyday whatever,
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.500]   "and there are gonna be moments ahead
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.100]   "where I'm gonna randomly show up.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.620]   "You're gonna stumble on the kingdom of God
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.540]   "in the gym, in the boardroom, in the classroom,
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.200]   "and the question is, will you respond?
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.140]   "Will you give it all?
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.220]   "Will you go, 'This is a moment of the kingdom of God
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.740]   "'that I cannot deny, and it's worth my everything for this.'"
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.860]   That colleague in the workplace who doesn't believe in Jesus
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.600]   and has been a little bit hostile to the faith,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.300]   but shares that they're going through a divorce.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.020]   Will you pray for them?
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.900]   That person that you met in the gym
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.020]   who's going through a really hard time in life,
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.180]   will you take them out for a coffee
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.660]   and share Jesus with them,
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.300]   if you know that the Holy Spirit is at work?
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.180]   See, this is the kind of mentality, the values,
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.740]   the culture that he's trying to build here in the Vine
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.180]   when he's calling us into uncharted times.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:40.100]   We have to be willing to react to the unexpected activity
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.980]   of the kingdom of God in our lives.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.140]   What a joy that is.
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.140]   But then equally, we need to make sure
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.580]   we're intentional in searching it out.
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.060]   We need to be standing at the bow with the telescope
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.100]   saying, "I'm not just gonna passively wait
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.460]   "for Jesus to do it all.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.340]   "No, I wanna be looking as well.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.020]   "I wanna make sure that I'm going into my workplace
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.940]   "on a Monday morning, I'm in prayer saying,
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.460]   "'Lord Jesus, could you show me today
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.860]   "'who I could be praying for in my workplace?
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.900]   "'Lord Jesus, would you give me an opportunity
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.300]   "'to share the gospel today?
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.620]   "'Lord Jesus, my mother, who I've been trying
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.260]   "'to share my faith with for so long,
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.500]   "'but I will not give up.'"
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.260]   We have to be intentional in looking for the activity
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.180]   of the kingdom of God.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.540]   And when we see it, remember, we won't know
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.780]   what that specific activity is gonna be,
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.740]   but when we see it, whether we stumble over it
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.660]   or we're intentional about it, we respond.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:33.980]   We would not be able to stop the people
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.580]   trying to get into this building to worship with us
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:40.180]   on a Sunday if we were living truly in uncharted times.
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:45.540]   Because we would be so responsive
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.380]   to the work of the kingdom around us.
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.220]   Risk is hard.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:55.980]   It's not a big deal to risk somebody else's life.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.380]   It's not a big deal to risk somebody else's resources.
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.300]   But when you're called to risk your own,
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.980]   when you're called to give of yourself,
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.740]   that's when it gets difficult.
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.500]   That's when it's challenging.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.220]   And that's the second point here in the parable.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.380]   You see, when you're in uncharted waters,
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:15.660]   you need to understand that you cannot live two lives.
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.500]   You cannot live two lives.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.340]   You can't have one foot in one life
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.740]   and one foot in another life.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.100]   You can't expect to only give a little bit.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.500]   I love it because if Jesus had come up to the day laborer
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.580]   and said, "Hey, you just need to give a little bit.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.380]   "Just give a 10th of what you have
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.820]   "and then you could have the whole field."
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.060]   I think the day laborer would totally do that.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.500]   The merchant, "Oh, you just need to sell off
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.260]   "a couple of pieces of your stock and then you'll be fine."
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.460]   If I was to stand before you today and say,
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.820]   "Hey Vine, we're in a season of unchartedness
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.620]   "and you just need to give a little bit."
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:49.020]   I think all of you would be like, "Let's go, Andrew."
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.460]   But if I stand before you and say,
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.820]   "We're in a season of uncharted
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.860]   "and you need to give everything."
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.780]   And by that, I'm not talking finances.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.220]   I'm talking about your whole life, your values, your heart,
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.300]   what you're committed to, your goals, your dedication,
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.260]   your time, and yes, your resources,
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.980]   giving it all for the kingdom of God.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.300]   I wonder how many will respond.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.500]   But I have to present this in the way
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.700]   that Christ is bringing it to us.
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.540]   You cannot have your current life
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.180]   and a better life at the same time.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.940]   At some point, you're gonna have to make a choice.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:27.220]   At some point, we're gonna have to repent of some sin.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.460]   At some point, we're gonna have to try
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.900]   to receive the grace of God.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.140]   At some point, we have to commit ourselves to the therapy.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.780]   At some point, we're gonna ask some people to pray for us.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.500]   At some point, we need to make a change
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.380]   'cause you cannot have your feet in two different camps
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.780]   and expect to be effective.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.780]   He's like, "In a season of unchartedness,
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.420]   "it's 100% trust in me,
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.540]   "and you have to be fully in or you're fully out."
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.580]   There's no room for lukewarm.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.020]   There's no room for it.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.820]   It doesn't work in the kingdom of God.
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.900]   Now, that doesn't mean that there isn't a time for us.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.780]   It doesn't mean that I need some time
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.380]   to get my life in order.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.460]   I need a process of healing
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.860]   that will go through therapy over a period of time,
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.300]   or I need to take some time to repent of my sin.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.620]   That's gonna happen over time.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.420]   Of course, time frame's fine,
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.540]   but the question is, where's the posture of your heart?
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.980]   The posture, that's what Christ is looking for, is all in.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.900]   Even though it might take some time for my life to change
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.620]   and to get to where I want it to be,
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:28.580]   my posture from the start is I wanna give it all to Christ.
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.420]   I wanna serve him with everything.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.620]   I think he challenges us with this
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.100]   because he recognizes that risk
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.060]   is something that isn't something we naturally do.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.540]   We often think that risk is just random decision-making
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.060]   or like closing my eyes and throwing a dart at a dartboard
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.620]   and hoping something sticks, but that's not biblical risk.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.340]   If I was to define biblical risk for you,
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.580]   I would put it this way.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.980]   Biblical risk is this.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.020]   Risk is intentionally costly decision-making
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.740]   driven by intentionally calculated faith.
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.980]   And it's both of those things together.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.580]   Intentionally costly decision-making.
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.940]   This is gonna hurt me.
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.620]   This is not gonna be easy.
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.100]   I'm being called to do something
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.540]   that is gonna be challenging for me.
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.660]   I'm out of my comfort zone, but I'm trusting in Jesus.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.980]   And then intentionally calculated faith.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.380]   I'm not just giving up everything
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.380]   'cause the preacher told me to,
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.780]   but I've actually sat with this.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.740]   I prayed about it.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.300]   I've asked the Spirit to speak to me.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.620]   I've looked at the scriptures.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.540]   I've had my prayer partners pray with me.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.700]   I'm in my small group
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.100]   and we're working through this together.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.540]   And we've decided that, yes,
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.460]   the Holy Spirit is asking me to change my job,
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.940]   to do this, to do that.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.340]   And we've come to a conclusion
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.980]   that this is what God is saying.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.380]   So therefore I'm gonna marry
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.860]   the activity of costly decision-making
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.620]   with the calculated faith that I've been intentional about.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.940]   And I'm bringing those two things together.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.300]   When you do one of those things without the other,
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:58.540]   if you're just making costly decision-making without faith,
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.580]   you're stupid.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.180]   And if you are calculating your faith
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.620]   and not doing anything about it, you're a fool.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:09.860]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.500]   But it's when we bring the two of those things together
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.900]   that the kingdom of God does something in the city.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.180]   That's the beauty of this.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.580]   I think he's shaking us up
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.580]   because yeah, there is some stuff that's sitting on us.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.660]   Maybe some apathy we need to shake up.
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.060]   Maybe there is some reliance on the old
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.900]   and God wants to shake that off so we rely on him again.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.060]   Maybe we've been Matt followers and not Christ followers.
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.100]   There's a whole bunch of things.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.420]   But I think the main reason why Christ is calling us
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.460]   into the uncharted is because of Hong Kong.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:38.940]   It's because of this city.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.700]   It's because of the people of this city.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.180]   It's because we should be the pearl merchants
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.540]   looking for the pearls of great price
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.620]   in the people that are around us all the time.
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.140]   See, every human being made in the image of God
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.220]   has a pearl of great price within them,
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.060]   but sin covers it up.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.860]   Sin tears it away.
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.060]   Sin blocks people from seeing it.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.460]   But when we begin to live and to share
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.420]   and sing the new song of the gospel to people,
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.820]   when we begin to stand for the faith in radical new ways,
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.780]   when we begin to love people and show people the grace
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.140]   and the kindness and the beauty of the kingdom of God,
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.900]   when all of those things take place,
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.420]   we begin to reveal the pearl
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.500]   that is of great price in every person.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.900]   And some come to the kingdom of God.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.460]   What a beautiful thing that is.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.460]   I can't stand here telling you about risk today
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.940]   without actually then doing something and living that out.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:36.100]   It's really interesting as we've been wrestling
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.940]   with this message with you here this morning.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:39.900]   We knew that God was calling us
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.100]   to do something very different on Vision Sunday.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.740]   Normally on Vision Sunday, what we do
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:47.460]   is we actually invite you after the message to give,
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:51.140]   to give financially, to give sacrificially financially.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.140]   We always say above and beyond your normal ties and offerings
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.180]   and to give your finances towards the vision
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.580]   that God has for us.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.260]   But as we were sitting as a church
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.420]   and we were wrestling with this as a leadership,
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:03.620]   we were realizing that God was saying,
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.820]   "That's not what actually I wanna ask of the people today."
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.500]   And so we're actually gonna be doing something
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:13.500]   that is intentionally risky with you here this morning.
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:17.540]   And by not asking you for financial giving today,
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.540]   that actually puts the church at a bit of financial risk
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:22.260]   because normally Vision Sunday is a big offering
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.460]   that helps our church throughout the year.
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.900]   But I cannot stand before you today
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.740]   and talk about taking intentional risk from calculated faith
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.860]   and not be obedient by what God said.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.140]   God said, "Don't ask for giving on this particular day,
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.780]   ask for living."
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:43.140]   Ask for people to live the way that I'm calling them to live.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.380]   Ask the people to have values
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.340]   that I'm calling them to have values.
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.340]   That's what needs to be done today.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.540]   And look, the reality is down the line in six months,
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.900]   nine months, 10 months,
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.980]   when we discover a treasure in the field
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.020]   or we see that Pearl of Great Price
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.860]   and we know that the Holy Spirit is doing something
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:03.540]   amongst us in our ministries and we need to respond,
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.300]   I will have no shame coming before you
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.300]   on one future Sunday and saying,
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.900]   "Give, let's sell everything
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.660]   and let's get the treasure in the field.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.020]   Let's get the Pearl of Great Price."
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.980]   I will have no problem in the future coming before you
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.280]   and asking for your money.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.260]   But today, that wouldn't be the right thing to do.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:25.900]   Today, I wanna unpack this and ask you for you.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.660]   Ask for your life.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.820]   Ask for that posture of heart that we've been talking about.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:35.580]   The preparation for what is ahead.
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.900]   I want you in that boat, excited and nervous,
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.260]   playing your part,
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.140]   ready to discover whatever it is that's out there.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.780]   The phone has died.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.940]   The way we do this is through consecration.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.780]   Consecration is this biblical idea that you can see.
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:52.820]   We don't have time to go into it now,
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:56.020]   but on Tuesday night, here's what I wanna call you to.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.900]   On Tuesday night, we're having a prayer night
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.820]   and it's happening here at 7.30
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.940]   and the whole night is gonna be an act of consecration
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.400]   and we're gonna lead you through a place of consecration
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.320]   on Tuesday night.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.380]   I wanna encourage everyone in this church to come,
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:14.420]   which means that if you all did, that's a big problem
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.740]   and it's a good problem to have.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.620]   But I wanna call you to come because over that night,
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:23.000]   we're going to consecrate ourselves to this new season.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.260]   And in order to prepare for that,
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.660]   I'm gonna lead us in a moment in this,
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.420]   just in a few seconds, of consecration here today,
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.060]   which is just a precursor of what we wanna do
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.220]   in more detail on Tuesday night.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.320]   Consecration, biblically defined,
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.700]   is cleansing plus sacrifice plus devotion.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.540]   Cleansing, sacrifice, devotion.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.860]   And many times, God calls His people
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.100]   to a place of consecration.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.880]   I'm gonna read one scripture and then we're gonna pray.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:54.620]   Let me read this to you from Joshua chapter three
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.540]   'cause I want you to hear
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.460]   how God calls His people into this.
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.200]   Early in the morning, Joshua and all the Israelites
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.180]   set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.840]   where they camped before crossing over.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.040]   After three days, the officers went throughout the camp,
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.220]   giving orders to the people.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.660]   When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.440]   and the priests who are Levites carrying it,
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.940]   you are to move out from your positions and follow it.
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.780]   Then you will know which way to go.
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:17.900]   Notice this, since you have never been this way before.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:18.740]   There it is.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.360]   You are about to go into uncharted times,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.020]   God is telling Joshua and the Israelites.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.800]   You've never been in the promised land before.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.380]   This is a land you have never set foot in before.
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.180]   You have never been this way before.
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.820]   Then you will know which way to go
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.120]   since you have never been this way before,
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.300]   but keep a distance of about 1,000 yards
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.140]   between you and the ark.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:37.980]   Do not go near.
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.740]   Joshua told the people, here it is, consecrate yourselves,
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.580]   for tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.060]   I believe wholeheartedly that tomorrow,
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.540]   however that will be defined,
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.100]   God is gonna do some amazing things amongst us.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.060]   It begins, though, in consecration.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.780]   A cleansing, Lord, would you forgive me of my sin
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.860]   and wash me afresh with your blood.
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:02.340]   A sacrifice, Lord, I'm willing to posture my heart
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:06.580]   so that when you act, I'm willing to respond with everything.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.620]   A devotion, a holy pursuit.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.940]   Remember I said in that download
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.180]   I wrote down on the piece of paper,
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:16.420]   the joy of the pursuit of God,
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.300]   the devotion, the scripture reading, the prayer,
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.500]   the quiet times, the small group commitment,
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.980]   whatever it is, the devotion, the pursuit,
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.060]   the positive pursuit of the presence of God.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.940]   As we cleanse and sacrifice and devote ourselves,
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.660]   we consecrate ourselves to a season of being uncharted.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.360]   And that's what I wanna call us to now.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.480]   So I wonder whether you would do an important thing with me.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.320]   And this is if you feel this is something
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.440]   for you to respond to.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.680]   It may not be possible for everybody
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.160]   'cause the chairs can be super tightly packed,
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.480]   but the posture in the scriptures around consecration
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.040]   is a humble one, it's a posture of being on the knees.
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.160]   So I wonder as I pray for us on this Vision Sunday,
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.780]   as we dedicate ourselves to uncharted times ahead,
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.880]   you would join me on your knees.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.880]   Let's pray together.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:05.380]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:16.000]   As you get on your knees,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.040]   one of the things that we're going to do,
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.640]   and I want you just to be in this posture of prayer.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:26.320]   In a moment, I'm gonna have our host
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.160]   pass out communion elements to you.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.520]   And we're gonna take communion as a response today.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.640]   But before that, I wanna pray for us.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.960]   So let's just posture our hearts before him.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:43.480]   Father, we thank you so much for this moment.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.120]   Lord, we don't take this lightly.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.560]   Lord, your church on your knees before you,
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.720]   it's a beautiful thing.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:57.060]   Lord, I really thank you, Lord, that the phone has died.
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:00.740]   I thank you, Lord, that you've moved us
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:01.940]   out of our comfort zone.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:05.720]   I thank you that you so love this city,
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.920]   that you're calling your church to its knees,
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.920]   to be consecrated before you,
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:17.080]   so that like the day labor and the merchants,
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.520]   we would joyfully give it all
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.600]   on behalf of what you're about to do.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.360]   We don't know what you're gonna do.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:28.120]   We don't have the strategy, the resources,
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.280]   the gift or the wisdom,
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.720]   but what we do have is you.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:36.520]   And you believe that the cost of giving your life
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.600]   was enough, that we were worth it.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.480]   Lord, as we are here on our knees before you,
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.080]   it's our way of saying, you are worth it.
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.360]   Father, I pray for every person here
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.160]   who's going through difficult times.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:55.520]   Lord, I wanna pray that this year
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:00.520]   could be a year of uncharted fruit and breakthrough.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:06.560]   Lord, for those in this room who are struggling,
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:12.220]   Lord, I wanna pray for uncharted peace.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:17.720]   Uncharted peace.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.760]   And Lord, most of all,
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:26.360]   for all of us here who call the Vine our home church,
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.000]   Lord, we humble ourselves on our knees
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.480]   and we ask for outrageous faith.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:34.440]   We ask for a faith that is way beyond
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.400]   what we currently hold.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.920]   We ask for the joy that was in that day laborer
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:40.760]   to give it all.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:46.800]   Lord, we cleanse ourselves through the washing of your blood,
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.400]   through the forgiveness of your grace,
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.760]   through the forgiveness of our sins.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.080]   Lord, I wanna pray your blood
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.320]   over every person in this room.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.600]   Lord, there are sins that many of us carry,
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.280]   some that deeply entangle.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.800]   Lord, we pray for freedom in the name of Jesus.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.920]   Lord, we pray for the blood to cleanse your church,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.840]   to purify your bride.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:14.100]   Lord, we pray for the sacrifices that are to come.
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.400]   Lord, I wanna pray that you would put a burden
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.240]   and an unreasonable hope in each person in this room,
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.320]   that they would give up their time and their energy
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.560]   and their resource and their life
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.720]   and their decisions for your kingdom, Lord Jesus.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.480]   It'll look different for every single one of us.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.680]   Lord, in our workplaces, our education institutions,
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.840]   our families, our homes, Lord, would you move?
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:42.960]   Lord, would you ask us a high price, Lord?
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:46.440]   And would your church be willing to give?
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.520]   And Father, we pray for devotion to be stirred.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:56.360]   Lord, I wanna pray for a fire in the name of Jesus
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.520]   over every single person here for your word.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.520]   I wanna pray that your Bible would come alive
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.480]   in the hearts of our church like never before.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.480]   Lord, I wanna pray that people would be hungry
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.900]   to read the Scriptures.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.040]   Those of us, myself included at times,
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.360]   that fall asleep when we read the Scriptures,
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.000]   would you keep us awake, Lord?
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.880]   Would you bring your word alive?
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.240]   Would you speak, Lord?
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.040]   Would we be like the disciples on the road to Damascus
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.560]   who would honour you by saying,
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:24.160]   "We're not our hearts burning within us
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.160]   when you open the Scriptures to us?"
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.120]   Lord, would prayer be released over the divine church
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.920]   in the name of Jesus, Lord?
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.240]   Would we find ourselves on our knees,
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.960]   praying for one another, praying for our city,
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.860]   praying for the lost, praying for revival?
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:40.680]   Lord, would you break us, Lord?
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:45.800]   Lord, would devotion be here in the name of Jesus?
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.640]   Lord, would we consecrate ourselves?
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.000]   So in this posture of consecration,
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.360]   I'm gonna invite the host just to come.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   They're gonna pass out the bread,
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.040]   they're gonna pass out the cup,
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.840]   and they're gonna pass out both of those things
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.200]   at the same time.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.320]   I want you to just take in your hand
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:09.560]   and don't allow the elements to break
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.080]   where you are in prayer right now,
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.200]   but just receive them, keep them in your hand,
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.920]   both the cup and the bread.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.120]   We're gonna share them all together
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.480]   as one church in a moment.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:24.040]   But the communion is where we are unifying
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.280]   our expression of consecration today.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:31.160]   I'm gonna invite Kala, she's gonna come
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:36.160]   and just lead us in a time of communion in just a moment.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.740]   (gentle music)
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:42.160]   (gentle music continues)
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.580]   (gentle music continues)
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:49.000]   (gentle music continues)
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.420]   (gentle music continues)
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.840]   (gentle music continues)
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:59.260]   (gentle music continues)
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:02.680]   (gentle music continues)
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.100]   (gentle music continues)
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.520]   (gentle music continues)
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.940]   (gentle music continues)
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:17.360]   (gentle music continues)
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.780]   (gentle music continues)
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:24.200]   (gentle music continues)
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.540]   (gentle music continues)
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:31.960]   (gentle music continues)
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.540]   (gentle music)
