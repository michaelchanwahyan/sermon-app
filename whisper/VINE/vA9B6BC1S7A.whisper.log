[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Would you believe that change?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Would you believe that change?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Would you believe that change?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Would you believe that change?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   There's a voice, sounds of wonders from above
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   When you put out your springboard
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   On the old and new
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   In the power of your presence
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Holy Spirit reign, fall in like a flood
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Break upon my praise as I sing of your love
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Holy Spirit fly, burn within my soul
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   As I call on your name
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   As I call on your name
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Drifting visions of the sun
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   As I stand in your presence
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Revelations of your love
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   As I look to the heavens
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Holy Spirit reign, fall in like a flood
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Break upon my praise as I sing of your love
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Holy Spirit fly, burn within my soul
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   As I call on your name
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   As I call on your name
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   As I call on your name
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   As I call on your name
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   As I call on your name
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Holy Spirit fly
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Oh, we call upon your name
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Oh, would you fill our hearts
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Would you fill this place, would you fill our hearts
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Your word brings life, your word brings healing
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Within your presence
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Holy Spirit burn like a fire
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Sing it out, church.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   All Christ's children
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   In your presence
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   All Christ's children
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Oh, we call upon you
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Oh, we call upon you
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Oh, Holy Spirit
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Oh, we call upon you
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Oh, we call upon you
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Oh, we call upon you
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Oh, in your presence
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Lord, I surrender
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   To your glory
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   For yours is the glory
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Living water
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   River wild in me
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   In mercy
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   In your mercy
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Open heaven
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Crashing over me
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Restore me
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   In your glory
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Oh, Holy Spirit
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Burn like a fire
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Oh, come to me
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Come to me
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   In your presence
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Lord, I surrender
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   To your glory
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   To your glory
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Oh, in your mercy
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Oh, in your mercy
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Oh, in your mercy
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Oh, we call upon you
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   We need you, God
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   We need you, Lord
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Sing, Holy Spirit
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Oh, Holy Spirit
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Burn like a fire
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Oh, come to me
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Come to me
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   In your presence
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Lord, I surrender
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   To your glory
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   To your glory
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Holy Spirit, come on
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Holy Spirit, come on
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Meet us where we are
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Thank you for who you are
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Holy Spirit, rain
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Fall in my cup of blood
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Break upon my praise
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   As I sing of your love
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Holy Spirit, fire
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Burn within my soul
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   As I call on you
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   As I call on you
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Would you cry out to Him, too?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   As I call on you
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Jesus
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   As I call on you
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   In the name of Jesus
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   As I call on you
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Jesus
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   As I call on you
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Jesus
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   As I call on you
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   As I call on you
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I wonder if you just take a moment
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Just as we've been singing Jesus
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Speaking His name
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   If you just open your hands where you are right now
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   The very last thing that's in the Bible is a simple prayer
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   It's "Come, Lord Jesus"
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I don't know what's happening in your life right now
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Or what things you're holding
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   But there is a power
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   In the name of Jesus
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   So for you this morning
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   As you think about what it is that you're carrying in this time
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Just that simple prayer, "Come, Lord Jesus"
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Come, Lord Jesus, to this area of my life right now that's broken
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Come, Lord Jesus, to this part of my relationship with my spouse
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   That needs healing and renewal
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Come, Lord Jesus, for my business that I want to see go to the next level
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Come, Lord Jesus, in my heart, in my relationship with you
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Whatever is relevant for you, just take a moment to pray that prayer for you
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Just invite the Holy Spirit to come
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Thank you, Jesus
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   So good
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   It's a beautiful thing that Paul writes in the New Testament
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   He says, "I'm not ashamed of the gospel"
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And as we are worshipping together today
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I felt like the Lord take those words and say them back over us
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And I think this is important for some of you here
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   I felt like God was saying, "I'm not ashamed of you"
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I love you so much
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I created you, formed you, shaped you
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   There's nothing that you have done
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   There's nothing that you're currently doing
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And there's nothing that you will do that will cause me to be ashamed of you
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   For I see you through the life, death and resurrection of my son Jesus
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And I love you, you're my beloved
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I'm here for you
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I see you
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I'm not ashamed of you
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Father, I pray you would liberate us from the fear of shame
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Lord, I pray you would liberate us from the things that we think about you that are not true
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I pray you would liberate us, Lord
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   From the ways in which we hold ourselves back
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Because we think you think a certain way about us
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Forgive us, release us
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   You are not ashamed of us
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And we are not ashamed of the gospel
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   We are not ashamed to carry your name in our city
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   We are not ashamed to speak your name over our workplaces
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   We are not ashamed to speak our name over each other as a family
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Because we believe that there is healing, redemption, release and power in your name
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   So we say, "Come Lord Jesus"
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   There is no name that is higher than the name of Jesus
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   So we say, "Come Lord Jesus"
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Over every situation and circumstance of family and friendship
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Over every marriage, over every home
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Come Lord Jesus
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And as we are here on Vision Sunday today
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   We ask you humbly to come again for our church
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Father, we need you
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Father, we can't do this on our own strength
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Hong Kong is too valuable
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   This time in history is too important
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   For us to waste energy in our own strength
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Come Holy Spirit and fall on your church in this city
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Open our mouths, open our hands
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Open our resources
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   May we give you glory
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   In Jesus
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Everyone says, "Amen"
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Hey, can we just give Jesus honor
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Why don't you turn around and say hi to someone as you sit down
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   And say, "Wow, so nice to see you"
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   "Welcome to The Vine"
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   "Who are you?"
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   "I should get your phone number"
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   "No!"
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Well, maybe, I don't know
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Well, welcome to The Vine, my name is Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   We're so glad that you are with us
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   If you're new to The Vine, welcome
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   You couldn't have come on a better Sunday
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   In the name of Jesus, Amen
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   You could not have come on a better Sunday
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Because today is Vision Sunday
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And I'm going to unpack some things for you today
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Whether you're a first timer with us
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Or whether this is a regular place of worship for you
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   That I believe the Lord wants to speak to you
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And I want to frame it by taking you back a few years
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Starting in March 3rd of 2019
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Sunday, March 3rd, 2019
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Where on that day I stood before you on Vision Sunday
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   And I unpacked for you what has come to be known as
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   The River Model Vision for us here at The Vine
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   About six months prior to that Sunday
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   I was praying about the future of The Vine
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   This is back in 2018
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   And I felt like God said something very clearly
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   He said, "The way you think about church has to change"
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   "The way that you as a community together think about church needs to change"
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   "You need to stop thinking about church as a building"
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   "Or using the metaphor of church like a house"
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   "And instead start thinking of a church like a river"
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   "You need to start thinking of church more like a flowing river in a city"
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   "Rather than a static house planted in the land"
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And it was interesting because what God was really saying is
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Church, of course, is not a building, it's a people
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And if church is a people, then church happens
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Wherever those people are living out the gospel in their sphere of influence
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And as I prayed and was receiving this
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I saw this vision of a river flowing in a nation
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   I want to show you a picture of what I saw
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   I literally saw that in my prayer time
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   That's actually the Amazon River flowing in the basin of Brazil
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And God said, "This is what I have on my heart for the church"
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   "I want the church to be like a river flowing in its city"
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   "Bring the hope of the gospel to all the dry and weary parched lands"
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And if you think about the church as just one static location
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And you expect everybody to come to you
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   You're not actually going to have impact in your city
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   The church has to be outwards, flowing outwards
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Every single person in this room has a sphere of influence where the gospel matters
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   A sphere of influence where Jesus matters
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And God was saying, "We need to shift"
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Now, I don't know if you can think how incredibly prophetic this call was on us as a church
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Literally at the start of 2019
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Just months away from when the plug fell out of the whole world
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And everything turned upside down
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   For us here in Hong Kong, we had a year before everybody else suffered
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   We had a year of the social movement which turned everything upside down in our city
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And then right off the back of that, COVID came
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And we had that for the last two and a half to three years
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And just before all of that happened, before a long season
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Where for many Sundays, we literally had to close our physical gatherings
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   God showed up before that and said, "The church is not a physical gathering"
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   That there is this thing that when we come together, life happens and we love it
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   But if you close a physical gathering, you are not closing the physical and spiritual movement of the gospel in a city
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Are you with me?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Like you can close the doors of a building, but you cannot close the door of the human heart
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   And we began to think that if church is this way
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Then actually when all the stuff that happened during the process and during COVID came
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I think we were incredibly placed to be able to get in the flow differently
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And God is saying, "This is how you must continue to be"
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Because there are challenges ahead of us
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   There are going to be some things ahead of us here in our city that we are not yet aware of
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Perhaps we are not even prepared for yet
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   And yet if we continue to think about ourselves as a church that flows and moves forward
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   We will begin to really believe that we can bless our city
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And we had this incredible vision of what it would be like if the vine that gathers in one chai
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Actually spread out and started connecting throughout our whole city
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   That we might actually see this place truly changed with the power of the gospel
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Amen?
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Amen?
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Come on church, stay with me
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   So today I want to talk to you about movement
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I want to talk to you about flow
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Because one of the greatest strategies I think the enemy has against his church
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Is to stop it flowing and moving forward
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Rivers, by their very definition, are things that always move forward
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   In fact, if you take a river and you stop its forward momentum
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   If you stop its forward flow, it no longer is a river anymore
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And it gets named by something else, it gets called a lake
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   I want to be really clear, God has not given us a lake model vision here at the vine
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   He's given us a river model vision
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   And if it's a river model vision, what that means is we need to be moving forward
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   We need to be progressing and flowing by His Holy Spirit in the land that we're planted in
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Now rivers flow simply by rain falling in higher elevations
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And the water then either seeping into the ground and joining and forming there
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Or in the runoff on the top of the surface of the ground
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Flowing from a higher elevation to a lower elevation and eventually out into the sea
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   That's how rivers actually flow
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Now here's the incredible thing
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Rivers very rarely flow in a straight line
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   And oh my goodness, the last four years has not been a straight line
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   But here's the great thing about thinking about a church like a river and not a building
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Because when obstacles come in your path
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   When the land around you changes
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Rivers are able to adapt to the contour of the land in which they're planted in
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Have you ever noticed that a river can sometimes flow around the stones and the rocks around it?
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Rivers have this amazing ability to weave and flow and fit to the contour of their land
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   And if there's anything we've had to do over the last four years
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Surely it's had to be flexible to move
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   When our land puts an obstacle in its way
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   We as a church need to make sure we can continue to flow around it
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   That no obstacles create boundaries that turn the church into a lake
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Because lakes become stagnant
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   But the church is meant to be alive
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   There are two things that impact the flow of a river
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   These two things impact the speed and the power within which a river flows
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   These are friction and gravity
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Friction impacts the speed of a river
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Gravity impacts the power that that river has
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Let me unpack both of these real quick for you
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   See, friction takes place in a river when there are stones or rocks placed within it
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Or when sediment builds up inside of it
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   That weighs it down and stops it from flowing really fast
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   And I think if we're honest with ourselves
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   We've had some pretty large stones placed in the rivers here in Hong Kong
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   In the church in the last three or four years
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   And those things do have the power to create friction in us
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   I think if we're honest with ourselves
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   There has been a lot of friction amongst us
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   A lot of friction in our families over the last three to four years
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Particularly during the social movement
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   There was a lot of friction politically in our city
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Which created breakdowns in relationships
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Some really valuable and important relationships were placed in great friction because of that
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   And I think if we're honest with ourselves
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   It was also here at the church too
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   There were times over the last three to four years
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Where friction, not just with the social movement
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   But with COVID as well
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   With government policies and procedures
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Some that we agreed with perhaps
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Some that we didn't agree with
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Navigating the tensions and the frustrations in the midst of all of that
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Has indeed created frictions even within our own relationships here at the church
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And any time there's friction, the church will slow down
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Sediment is also important
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   See, sediment in a river is the buildup of soil or dirt
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Or small little pebbles that are found in the river
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And if sediment builds up enough
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   It becomes like a sludge within the river itself
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And the weight of that slows again the flow of the river
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   And I think for us, there's been sediment at work around us as well
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   That's the emotional things that we've been carrying in the last three to four years
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   The fact that some of that emotional stuff is still wearing down on us
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   The fact that we've had some challenges in the area of our mental health in the last three to four years
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   We've carried on stress
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And some of us have even felt traumatized through what has happened over this time period
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And that's like the sediment that's found in a river
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And unless a river is able to drain that sediment away
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   It will slow down the flow of it naturally
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And I think in the same way, God is challenging us as a church
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   If we really want to flow in 2023
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Not only do we need to deal with the frictions that are there in our relationships
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   We also must deal with the releasing of the sediment that is built up inside of our spirits
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Inside of our emotions, even inside of our minds
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And try to find ways of getting rid of that
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   So that we can flow in the way that God calls us to
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   This is why from next Sunday onwards for four weeks
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   I'm going to do a series here with you called "When the Journey is Too Much"
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And we're going to talk about mental health and mental wellness
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   We're going to take a look at the Apostle Paul and the Prophet Elijah
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And we're going to look at the ways in which sediment built up for them
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   And how they were able to release the sediment in their lives
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   So they could continue to flow in the ministry God had called them to
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And my prayer for you over those weeks is that you would be able to release
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Some of the sediment that may have built up for you
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   That's friction, okay?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   But here's the other bit
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Friction slows down the speed of a river
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   It's gravity that impacts the power of a river
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Gravity is this amazing thing
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   It's an unseen force
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   But it's powerful to literally pull that water from a higher elevation
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Down to a lower elevation
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   And eventually out into the sea
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   It is gravity that works upon the water
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   To move it from one place to another
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   To literally pull it down towards its exit point in the ocean
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   And if that's the reality of gravity and what it does to the flow of a river
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   And if God is speaking to us still that the vine is not to be a building but a river
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Then here's the key question we need to keep asking ourselves
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   What is the gravity that God is using upon us
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   To ensure that we continue to flow and move more and more
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Towards the vast ocean of his kingdom in Hong Kong
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Are you with me still?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   What is the gravity for us that's going to move this thing forward
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   That's going to pull the vine into the right direction as we move forward
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Today in this talk I want to give you an answer to that question
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   And as I do so
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Let me start by telling you about some of the forward momentum
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   That I feel God has got for us this year
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   One of the key ways that we're moving forward and flowing in the river this year
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Is of course through our church plant in Yuen Long
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And Yuen Long are watching this right now
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   They're gathering in their temporary space in a kindergarten in Yuen Long
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Pastor Tim and Pastor Ivan are there right now
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   And I'm going to look into this camera
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   You're all going to turn and look into the camera
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And you're going to wave and say, "Hey, Yuen Long, you guys are awesome
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   We miss you, we love you, we're so glad you're a part of this."
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Yes
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   So we've already launched our church there
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Meeting in this temporary space
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   As we get ourselves ready to formally launch the church
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Towards the summer of this year
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   And last year at Vision Sunday
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   We invited each one of you to give towards the operating expenses of the church for one year
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And you guys gave over $7 million last year
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   So that we could get that church up and running
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Cover their operational expenditure for one year
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Which takes the whole pressure off Tim and Ivan
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   They can pass to that church without having to worry about that income coming in for that first year
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And that was an incredible blessing for them
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   But this year, we're in a situation now
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Where we've got this project manager who's helping us find a location there
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   We've got an attended environment where they've come up with designs
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   For what our church premises will look like
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And this year on Vision Sunday, today
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I'm inviting you to raise $6.5 million
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   And that $6.5 million is what we need to be able to renovate a venue in Yuen Long
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   So that we can hopefully formally launch our services in the summer of this year
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   So that's the ask today
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   I'm putting that right up front and I hope that's okay
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   You should never feel ashamed to ask people to give to something you're passionate about
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   So we're looking for $6.5 million for the fit out of a premises in Yuen Long
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   But Yuen Long's not the only way we're flowing this year
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   There are some other things that we're also doing
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   And we're excited about these as well
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I mentioned about the sediment earlier
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Well this is something that we're leaning into as a church
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Because God has always called the Vine to be a place of healing and restoration
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And so we're helping to process some of that sediment in us this year
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   By making some investments in some areas where we can do that
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   So you know that we have a counselling centre here at the Vine called Oasis
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   It's our centre of counselling and psychotherapy
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   We're going to be further investing into that this year
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Helping to grow the team there
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   And begin to really serve the mental health need that there is in Hong Kong in this time
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And one of the things that I'm really happy to let you know
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Is that now Oasis is actually ministering to around 80% people who are not part of the Vine
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   And this is something we've always wanted with this ministry
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   We've not wanted it just to help serve us, although that's important
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   But we wanted to serve the city
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And now 80% of their clients actually do not attend the Vine
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   And they're just out there in the city somewhere
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   And that is awesome
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   We're also going to be shifting into some new ministries here at the Vine this year
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And one of those areas is in the area of inner healing
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   We're having one of our pastors move into a new role
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Where they're going to be like a restoration pastor for us
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   And helping us to just lean into courses and ministry
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   And various prayer ministry
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   To really help people to let go of some of that built up sediment
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   That's happened in their lives over the last three to four years
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   We want to put resources into that space so we can flow well
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And one of the other important things is you come out of something like COVID
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   As we're emerging, no masks today or maybe masks
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   It depends on how you're feeling
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   And that's freedom to be however you want to be
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   But what's amazing is we're emerging out of COVID
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Is that we also need to find community again with one another
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   And so our community groups, our ways in which we want to connect
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   To the various communities at this church
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Is going to increase this year
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And you would have noticed already, you've been coming to the Vine for a little while
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   That we started some new initiatives to try to connect people on Sundays
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And help them to be a part of this church and not be anonymous
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   That's going to continue throughout the year
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   We're also investing in our generations ministries
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Our kids, youth and young adults
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Because we believe family is so important
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Particularly again in this time of emerging out of the crisis that we've been in
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Family, strengthening family, working with families, incredibly important
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Our missions work
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   We're now moving out into our neighbourhoods much more than we've done before
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   As well as the pathways that we do here throughout the year
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   We're also creating initiatives for you to get involved
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   In really understanding the neighbourhood better
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   We call these neighbourhood conversations
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   We've been talking about these over the last number of weeks
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   We've had some incredible connection points
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   With people here in Wan Chai
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Learning about how they're doing
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Understanding the small businesses in our environment
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   So that we can be a blessing to those that actually are living around
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Where this part of the river is currently flowing
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Does that sound good?
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   So those are some of the things that we're doing
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   But I actually don't want to take a lot of time today
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Telling you about all the things that we're going to do
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   And there's a very important reason for that
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Because normally here on Vision Sunday
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   What I do is I kind of use the whole message
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   To unpack all the great and exciting stuff we do
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   And then invite you to give towards that
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   But about two months ago
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   As I was praying for today
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   I felt God give me a very strong word
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   It was actually a word for me personally
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   And it was a word of rebuke
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Now when God speaks a word of rebuke to you
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Two things happen
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   One is "Ugh, no!"
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   The other is "You're set free"
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   And so when God spoke this word to me
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   It was difficult
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   But now I believe I'm standing before you
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Two months later set free
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And I want to unpack a little bit about what God said to me
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Because I think it's also something
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   He might be saying to more of us in this room as well
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   I was on this walk
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   You guys know that I receive prayer when I walk
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   So I was on this walk in Hong Kong in the hills
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Beautiful hike
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   And as God began to speak to me
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   He said "Andrew, in this season of the vine I'm doing a new thing"
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And that's something we've lent into
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   In the last couple of months
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   As we opened up this new year
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   We looked at Isaiah 40 to 55
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And the whole new thing that God does there
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And God was saying "I'm doing a new thing, Andrew
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   So I want you to do a new thing on Vision Sunday"
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   And He said "I need you to understand, Andrew
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   That there's something going on in your life
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   That is actually stopping the flow of the river at the vine
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   That I want to do"
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Now when you're the senior pastor of the church
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   And God shows up and says "You're the problem"
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   That's a sobering thing to hear, right?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   But I felt like God was saying
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   "Andrew, there's something in you that's stopping the flow
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And I need you to do something different on Vision Sunday"
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   I realised that I had come
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Over the many years that we've done Vision Sunday here
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   That I had come to understand or think
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   That the gravity that moves the vine forward
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Is a really well and articulated vision
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   I had come to convince myself
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   That the thing that's moving us forward
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   The gravity, if you will, that moves us from one location to the next
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Moves us forward
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Is a really well articulated vision to you
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Now I want you to be clear about something
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Vision, of course, is not wrong
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Vision is great, vision is needed
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   The Bible even says "Without a vision people perish"
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   And I don't want you to perish
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   So we're going to keep talking about vision at the vine
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Vision is a part of who we are
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   This day is still called Vision Sunday
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   But I also need you to hear this
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And this is what I needed to hear by the Holy Spirit
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   I had come to think
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   That the way this thing moves forward
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   This idea of church
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   It moves forward through my ability
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   To discern what God is saying to us
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   And then my ability to stand in front of you on a particular Sunday
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   And communicate what God is doing
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And do it, hopefully, in such a clear and articulate way
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   That you rationally hear it
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And go "Oh, that sounds like a worthy financial investment"
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   I want to be honest with you
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   I think there are some Vision Sundays in the past
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Maybe not all, but some
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Where I approach it a bit like an investment strategy
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   We're in Hong Kong, after all
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   And I thought, well, if I could just get up there on a Sunday
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   And give you a rational reason
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Why you should give, not only that
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   But as you give, show you that you're going to have a positive rate of return on your investment
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Then you're more likely to give
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And so I began to think that the gravity was down to me
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   That the gravity was down to how I speak the vision
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   And the gravity was like some sort of investment strategy
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   That hopefully convinces you to rationally give to this church
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Now I want to say this, because this is really important
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   So much of the giving in Scripture is actually irrational
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Come on, church
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   So much of the giving that we actually see in Scripture is actually irrational
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   In fact, there is an element of irrationality in the giving experienced in God's kingdom
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Now by irrationality, I'm not saying it's giving done without any thoughts
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   I'm not saying it's giving done without any kind of reflection, no
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   In fact, the irrational giving in Scripture comes with a lot of reflection
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   A lot of thinking
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   In fact, that's why people respond in that way
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   What I mean by irrational giving is not that it's not done with thought or care or reflection
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   It's done by a different barometer for success
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   And a different reason to give it than how the world might encourage us to give like in an investment
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   In other words, it actually becomes much more something that is faithful and true to the kingdom
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Even if it looks irrational to the world
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Is anybody still here?
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Are you okay, upper house?
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   You alive?
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Give me a wave
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Ah
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   The fact that you're sitting in the upper house right now
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And the fact that you're sitting here in the lower house right now
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Is because there are a group of crazy Christians 12 years ago who were irrational
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Come on, church
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   You see, this used to be a dilapidated porn theater
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   It was
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   It was a dilapidated porn theater
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And it had been like that for 10 years
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And nobody was mad enough to make an investment in this building
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And in fact, many people had come to think about investing here
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   But because you can't actually build on top of it, it was a poor investment for people
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   So we showed up to our landlord and we said, "Well, we don't want to build upwards
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   We want to actually just use this facility for this thing that we've got
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   It's the idea of the kingdom of God
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Can we tell you about this?"
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   And it was kind of crazy
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And then we started to go to the church and everybody thought we were mad
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   They were like, "You don't own the building
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   You're going to put how much money and build a building that you don't actually own
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   You're putting all this money into somebody else's pocket
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   That's not a rational, financial, sound act to do
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Like, why would you do that?"
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And so many people thought we were mad
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   And we're now sitting in the reality of the irrationality of some giving of a previous generation
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Because they didn't give based on some sound financial plan
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   They gave based on something else
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Are you with me still?
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And the question is, what is it that they gave from?
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   What was the gravity that enabled them to open up their hands
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   So that you would be the beneficiaries of it today?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   And I wonder whether you might be willing to open your hands
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   So there might be some beneficiaries of it tomorrow
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   What is it that was the gravity that really moves a church forward?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Well, to help you understand that, I want to actually go to a moment in Scripture
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   That is completely irrational in its giving
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   It's perhaps one of the most famous moments in Scripture where there's giving encountered for
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   And it's found in the book of Exodus
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And before I go into the Scripture, I'm so excited
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   You know, I've been working for about four years on our Exodus sermon series
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   We've traveled to Egypt, we've gone to Jordan, we've filmed all the stuff that we want to film
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   So that series is starting the Sunday after Easter
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   So that's April 16th, right here
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   We're going to begin our Exodus sermon series
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   If there was ever a series to invite your friends and family to, it's this one
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Every Sunday we have little films that we'll be showing each week
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   I'm really excited about it
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   That's enough of a plug in Jesus' name, everyone says, Amen
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   But I want to go to the book of Exodus together today to this moment in chapter 36
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And the reason why we're going there is because there is this moment of irrationality that happens
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   That is so beautiful and so kingdom
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Now, before we read it, let me give you some of the background
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   So, Egypt has come out of their slavery
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   God has delivered them into freedom
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And they're now in this desert, wandering around before they go into the promised land
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   And as they're wandering around the desert, they want to construct a place
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Where God's presence could be with them
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   They're still nomadic at this time, which meant they were moving around all the time
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   So rather than build a temple, which would come much later in the promised land
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Now they build a tent
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   It's known as the tent of tabernacle, the tent of meeting
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   And Moses comes before the people and he says, we're going to make this tent
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   And it's going to be amazing
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   And I want you to participate in your giving
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   So that we can construct this tent
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   So this is a building project in scripture
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   I want you to see what happens here from verse 2
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   "Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Ohaleb and every skilled person to whom the Lord had given ability
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   And who was willing to come and do the work
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And the people continued to bring free will offerings morning after morning
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   So all the skilled craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Left their work behind them and said to Moses, the people are bringing more than enough
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Notice this, more than enough for doing the work the Lord commanded to be done
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Then Moses gave an order and his word was sent throughout the camp
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   And so the people were restrained from bringing more
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Because they had already had more than enough to do all the work
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   This blows my mind
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   I mean, just track with what's happening here in this moment
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Moses has gone out and invited people to give to a building project
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   He said we want to put this tabernacle together, this tent together
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   And we would love for you to be a part of that
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   And so many people have responded
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   So many people were giving that the workmen who were constructing the tabernacle
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Had to put their tools down because they were so overwhelmed dealing with the offerings that were coming in
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   And they put their tools down and they go to Moses and they say, Moses, you need to make an announcement
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   You need to stop people from giving because we have already more than enough that we need
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   And so Moses, perhaps the first and perhaps maybe only ever Christian leader
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Has gone in front of his people and he said, stop giving
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Imagine that
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Imagine if I came to you next week after Vision Sunday and said, stop giving
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   You've given too much church
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   I don't know what to do with it
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   I'm going to do my normal pastoral job because I'm counting all the money
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   That's what's happening here
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   The word used here, restrained from bringing more
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Is a word in the Hebrew that means to physically stop someone
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   It was literally like the people were putting hands on people, stopping them from coming forward
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Because they were so excited to give
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   And when we see this, we have to ask ourselves the question, what is going on here?
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   I mean, this is irrational
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   What is the gravity that's causing these people to want to give in such a way?
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Well, to understand that, we jump back to chapter 35 where Moses explains the start of the project
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   35 verse 4 says this
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Moses said to the whole Israelite community, this is what the Lord has commanded
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   From what you have, notice this, from what you have, take a portion, an offering for the Lord
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Everyone who is willing is to bring to the Lord an offering of gold, silver and bronze
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Heights of sea cows, no idea what a sea cow is, but anyway
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Acacia wood, olive oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   And onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breast pieces
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   In other words, he goes to them and he doesn't shy away from telling them what to give
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   In the same way that I'm happy to stand before you today and say we need 6.5 million dollars
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And I love what Moses does here, he tells them what to give but he makes this big long list
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   And some things on this list only very wealthy people would be able to bring
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   But there are other things on this list that all the common people would also have been able to bring
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   In other words, what Moses is doing is he's creating an environment where everybody can contribute
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Where it's not, hey we're only looking for this
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   He's saying no matter your situation in life, no matter where you're coming from
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   No matter how much your household might have right now
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Everybody has the opportunity to be a part of this building project
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   And he creates the space for that
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   And that's something we always do here at The Vine too, like everybody has the opportunity
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   What's important to us is the communal act of giving rather than exactly what is given
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   The fact that we do it all together and we all have the opportunity to do it together is the beautiful thing
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   Now I want you to see one thing that Moses says here at the start
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   He says everyone who is willing
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Now this is so important, in fact there's five times in chapter 35 alone
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Where Moses mentions those who were willing
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Those who were willing brought this, those that were willing brought that
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Why is he emphasizing this?
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Because he's speaking to his people about freedom
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   People were not obligated, they were not coerced, they were not forced to give
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   They were totally free to give if they wanted to give
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   It was the willing who responded and stepped up to give
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   And there were so many who were doing that that they actually had to stop them from giving in the end
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   But Moses is making an important point here, he's saying the willing get to be a part of this
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Now this is so important that you track with this
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   Why do you think it's important that Moses is emphasizing freedom in this building project and in the act of giving?
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Well remember the Israelites had been slaves for 430 years
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   And when you're a slave there are two things that are the reality
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Number one, you don't own anything
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Number two, you have no freedom
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   And Moses understood if he came to his people and he said you're obligated to give
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   If you're going to be a part of this community, well then you have to give
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   And if you don't give, you're out of this community
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Then he's just enslaving his people once again
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   So he basically says you are free to do this however you want
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   In fact I want to read to you verse 29 of the end of chapter 20, 35
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   It says all the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the Lord free will offerings
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   For all the work the Lord had through Moses commanded to be done
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   They are willing and they are free to do whatever they want
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   And Moses is emphasizing the freedom because he does not want to enslave his people
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   But I also want you to recognize something
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Israel had been slaves
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   And God in his love and compassion saw them in their slavery
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Said that's not right for my people
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   And through miracle after miracle came down, set his people free, delivered them
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   And he's in the process of taking them towards the promised land
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   So these are a group of people who just 20 years beforehand
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   God had shown up and done a miraculous thing for them
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   God showed up and said your freedom matters to me
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   God showed up and said in love I'm going to change your situation
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   God showed up and said your slavery and your oppression is not right
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   And so God changed it out of his place of love
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   And there is this connection between love and freedom
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   And so then Moses comes and he says we have this building project
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   But I'm not going to coerce you, I'm not going to obligate you
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   I'm not going to slave you into something here
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   I'm just literally going to say you are free to respond however you want to respond
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And they responded so much that Moses had to tell them to stop giving
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   Why did they respond so much?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   Because they were people who knew that it was the love of God that had set them free
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And when an opportunity came for them to show their gratitude
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   To a God who has set them free, they jumped on it
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   And remember, these are not wealthy people
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Because they've been slaves for 430 years
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   And yes, when they came out of Egypt, they brought some of the gold and some things with them
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   But these are a poor group of people
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   The sound financial decision making for a family in Israel at this time would have been not to give
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   Well we just need to save up for our family
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Man, we've had long hard years of slavery
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   We haven't earned anything for years
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   And now we're finally beginning to get some wealth for our family
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Little Bobby needs to go to university in a few years time
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   And we're just going to put some money aside and we're going to do all this
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Now, don't get me wrong, stewardship of our resources is very important
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   But it blows my mind that these people have every excuse not to give, but they give
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   And they give so much that Moses has to tell them to stop
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Why? Because they are a people who have encountered the love of God and it has changed them
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   They give not because of some great vision
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   They give not because it's some sound financial decision
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   The reason why they give, the only reason they give, is from love
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   God has changed me
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   I am now free to honour him in any way I can for the change that he has made in me
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   See, love and love alone is the gravity that moves God's river forward in the kingdom of his city
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   Love
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   And I had for a number of years thought it was vision
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Thought it was a way of telling you a good investment to make
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   And this is why today I'm not unpacking all the things that we've got planned to do this year
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   Although we've got a lot of things planned
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   I'm literally just coming to you and saying
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   I wonder if you, like me, have struggled somewhat
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   And we need to get back to the heart of the matter
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   And the heart of the matter is
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   I want you to give out love today
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   You're free, completely
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Whether you want to respond or not
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   And in a bit of a moment's time we're going to do that together
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   You're free to do whatever you want
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   But I do not want you to give into something
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   I want you to give out of something
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   I'm going to say that again, so important church
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   I do not want you to give into something today
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   I do not want you to give into vision
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   I want you to give out of love
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   The Israelites did not give into vision
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   They gave out of love
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   And I believe that's the way that God always moves His church forward
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   It is a group of people saying, "God has changed me
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   How can I not do something now to express my gratitude
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   And my own love in freedom for somebody else?"
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   And you need to know in this room that God loves you
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Just like He loved the Israelites
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   In fact, it says in that most famous of our verses
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   That God so loved the world that He gave
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   And that maybe our response in that is to say
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   We so love our city
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   We so love the brokenness here and wanting to see it change
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   We so love the darkness and wanting to see it overcome with light
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   We so love the reality of what God's doing amongst us
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   That we're like God, willing to give of the most precious things
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   So that His love would actually find root in our city
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   That we would give out of something
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   Rather than giving in to something
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   When you give in to something, you're often wondering, "What's your return?"
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Oh, I'm going to say this, not my notes, but it's good
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   When you give in to something, you're always thinking, "What's my return?"
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   When you give out of something, you let it go
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   Wouldn't it be amazing if we gave just to let it go?
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Just to trust that God knows what He's doing
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   I want to finish by just highlighting one thing here
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Which I think is really important
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   It says, "Those who were willing gave"
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   I want you to know that God changes the world
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Not through those who are obligated or coerced
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   God changes the world through those who are willing
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   That's the way God works, by those who are willing
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   I love that Moses emphasises this reality of the willing
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Because it says something important to us
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   It says that there were people in Israel who were not willing
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   He doesn't say, "All of Israel gave"
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   And it wasn't like this big celebration that everybody in Israel gave
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   No, he said, "Those that were willing gave"
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Which implies that there were some within Israel that weren't willing
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   And here's the really thing that blows my mind
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Those who were not willing would still go on to receive the benefits
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   Of the future that was created by those who were willing
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   In other words, God does not go, "There's second class citizens here"
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   It wasn't like Moses later on said, "Hey, if you gave, you get the first entrance to the tabernacle
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   And if you didn't give, then you can only come back on Thursday at 2 o'clock"
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   It wasn't like Moses sorted out between those who were willing and those who weren't
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Whether they were willing or they weren't
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   They were always going to be swept up in what God does
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   That's the way God always works
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Whether you give today or not, you're going to be swept up
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   In all of the things that we do here at the Vine and all the ministry of the God
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   We're never going to judge
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   I'm not going to know who's given and who's not given
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   It doesn't work that way
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   It's kind of irrational
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Come on, church
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   It's kind of irrational
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   That those who give, and many of you in this room have given over the years
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   Incredibly sacrificially
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   And those that don't give experience the same thing
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   It would be those who were willing
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   Who would shape the future in Israel for those who were not
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   And those that were not would still benefit from it
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   And it will be the same for us
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   I said earlier that you're sitting in a room right now
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   That those who were willing before gave towards
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   And I wonder in the future
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   What rooms some generations in 10, 15, 20 years will be sitting in
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Because of the willing in this room right now
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Whether you give or not today
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   You're free to respond no matter how God leads you
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   But it will be the willing amongst us
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Who get the joy of participating in building the future of tomorrow
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   My prayer for you is that you, like me, would go through a regeneration of your spirit
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   That you would realize that sometimes we've made this whole giving thing more complicated than it really is
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   That while vision is important and stewardship of our finances are important
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   They are never the gravity that decides whether we give or not
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   The reason we give is because God loved us
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   And because he so loved us, he sent his son Jesus
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   And in the freedom that we now have in Jesus
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   We are free to be a part of the willing
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   Who shape the future of Hong Kong for the generations that come
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   That's the joy, that's the invitation
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   And that's how I want you to respond today
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   I wonder whether you would stand with me
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   And we're going to do a couple of things together
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   As we stand together, you'll notice that there are buckets around this room
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   There's a couple of baskets here, just in the corners here
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   There's a couple of baskets in the corners over here as well
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   In the upper house, there's some baskets at the front and some baskets at the back
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   As you came in today, you would have received an envelope
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   And in that envelope is an opportunity for you today, if you want to, to give through your envelope
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   You can write a check, put some cash in there
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   You can fill in your credit card details and the amount that you want to give
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   However you want to do that, you can use your envelope for that
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   And then over the next five minutes, as we're worshipping
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   You're going to be free to respond however you want
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   And those that would like to give in this room
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   You'll have an opportunity to do that as we worship together
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   And you can drop off those envelopes in the baskets
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   Also, if you would like to give by credit card directly today
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   We have a team from our finance department who are outside right here on the second floor
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   And they are really nice people
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   And I'm praying they're going to be very busy and tired by the end of the day
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   But you have an opportunity, if you want to give by credit card
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   To go and meet with them and they will process your credit card payment
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   That can happen also over the next five or so minutes as we're worshipping
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   Also on the screen behind me, for those that want to give digitally
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   Because that's a big thing right now, many of us are giving that way
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   We'll put the QR codes on the screens as we worship
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   So that you can give that way
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   This five minutes or so that we're now going to worship
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   Is a time for you to truly be free
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   If you want to partake in the offering today
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   I encourage you to do it in the next five minutes
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   If you don't, that's perfectly fine as well
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   None of us are going to be looking around, there's no judgement, no nothing like that
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   You are free to be willing to give
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   And as we do that, we get to do that in a spirit of worship together
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   And then at the end of that, I'm going to come back
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   And we're going to close our time together
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   With the most important thing we're going to do today
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   Which is communion
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   As we come around the ultimate symbol of love
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   As right now we give from that place of love
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   So five minutes or so, enjoy your time of giving and worship
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   And then after that, I'll come and close our service with communion
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
