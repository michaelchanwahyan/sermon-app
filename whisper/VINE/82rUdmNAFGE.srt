1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 Good morning to all of you.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,880
 - Good morning. - Good morning.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,560
 And for those who are online joining us live,

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,000
 good morning to you, or if you are in a different time zone.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,120
 I have this conviction that God has a word for you as well today.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,640
 Well, for some of us here in the audience,

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,760
 some of you are aware that I work in the medical sector.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,240
 Exactly 30 years ago, I flew off to the unknown land

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,920
 by the name of St. Louis, Missouri.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,040
 That was in the Midwest of US.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,360
 And that was 30 years ago I started my overseas fellowship training.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,720
 I learned from a leading expert who contributed tremendously in our field.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,400
 And he attempted to introduce a lot of new procedures

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,560
 that was really at the forefront of imagination at the time.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,560
 And he overcame many difficult hurdles

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,440
 and many radicals along the way.

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,480
 Some of his attempts failed, but others flourished

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,680
 and changed the surgical paradigm altogether.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,120
 He always reminded us that not all new things are good,

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,440
 but all good things must be new at one time.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,240
 Well, in a sense, my mentor journeyed through

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,920
 the many uncharted waters in his times.

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,480
 Well, he championed the advance of what is now commonplace,

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,720
 keyhole surgery.

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,360
 He contributed to bringing a new beginning in surgical practice.

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,360
 And I'm glad that I was along that wave.

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,160
 In fact, I find this word beginning amazing.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,840
 In Greek, it reads "akhe," which carries the meaning of origin,

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,520
 the beginning event, and early days.

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,840
 I'm particularly impressed when I read how different gospels

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,720
 begin their beginnings.

32
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,840
 So through the beginning of the story of Jesus Christ

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,880
 in the gospel of John, Luke, and Mark,

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,880
 I hope to explore the very subject,

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,000
 passing on, closure, and new beginnings.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,160
 John 1 says, "In the beginning was the Word,

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,000
 and the Word was with God.

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,920
 And the Word was God.

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,200
 He was with God in the beginning."

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,800
 It is groundbreaking to have a new interpretation

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,040
 of the very word "logos," which is translated as "word" here,

42
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,080
 and to understand that Jesus is the living Word.

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,040
 John also asserts that Jesus, the living Word,

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,600
 is with God from the very beginning.

45
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,760
 And you'll appreciate how he refers to Genesis

46
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
 when he wrote the gospel.

47
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,600
 "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,600
 That's the very first verse of the entire Bible.

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,480
 We can read the creation account in Genesis,

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,520
 a beginning as a celebration of God's goodness

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,640
 and faithfulness, and he's indeed declared that it is good.

52
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,400
 It is significant that we recognize that all beginnings

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,040
 are very much anchored in the first beginning in creation,

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,240
 ordained by God.

55
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,880
 We celebrate new beginnings exactly because

56
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,320
 God has been good, and he has been faithful

57
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,600
 from the very beginning.

58
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,840
 Next, we shall look at the gospel of Luke.

59
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,200
 Many have undertaken to draw an account of the things

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,800
 that have been fulfilled amongst us,

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,080
 just as they were handed down to us

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,360
 by those who were from the first,

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,080
 were witnesses and servants of the Word.

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,800
 From the first, the beginning.

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,960
 Now here, the word "handed down" means to pass on.

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,640
 It's a solemn act of passing on something really important.

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,640
 And you know, in Asian context, oral tradition

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,920
 is a very important means of transmitting the message.

69
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,240
 So the early Christian message was indeed passed on

70
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,880
 to others through this oral tradition.

71
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,440
 The very gospels that we know today

72
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,320
 were in fact written much later,

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,760
 probably at the year 70 AD,

74
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,720
 after Jerusalem has been destroyed by the Roman Empire,

75
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,560
 and most Jewish Christians were driven out of the city.

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,800
 But the gospels were written subsequently

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,880
 based on the original accounts,

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,120
 which were diligently preserved.

79
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,440
 So passing on the truth is a noble task.

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,680
 The same significance of passing on

81
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,720
 was also emphasized by the Apostle Paul

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,040
 when he wrote to the church in Corinth,

83
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,600
 "For what I received, I passed on to you

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
 as of first importance,

85
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,960
 that Christ died for our sins

86
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
 according to the scriptures."

87
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,840
 The gospel permeated the entire Greek Roman world

88
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,520
 exactly by believers who pass on the truth

89
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,280
 diligently and faithfully.

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,320
 Then the next question for all of us here is,

91
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,240
 what do we pass on as modern day believers?

92
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,240
 My wife Vivian and I plan carefully

93
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,040
 what we want to pass on to our adult children

94
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,520
 while in years down the road.

95
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,080
 So we drew up a will which was duly signed by witnesses

96
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,160
 that our material estate will be shared equally

97
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,280
 between the two of them.

98
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,000
 Well, my son is here actually.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 (audience laughing)

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,960
 So he may want to know what material estate I actually have.

101
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
 (audience laughing)

102
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,080
 Well, the thing is, while I also wonder

103
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,760
 whether I have also passed on

104
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,440
 a rich spiritual inheritance to each of them.

105
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,120
 I'm glad that when my daughter got married

106
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,040
 and entered into marital life,

107
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,880
 we passed on to her our love for each other

108
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
 as husband and wife.

109
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
 And indeed, besides loving God,

110
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,840
 loving our spouse is the most single important calling

111
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,360
 that we are to respond to as a married person.

112
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,200
 And as for my son, who is not yet married,

113
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,920
 I hope I can pass on to him

114
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,680
 my love for the family,

115
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,560
 my commitment to work, independence,

116
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,960
 and the ability to maintain hope

117
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,680
 in the midst of life's challenges.

118
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,080
 I do recognize that my mom passed on to me

119
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,720
 a lot of pessimism and worries for tomorrow.

120
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,520
 So it takes conscious effort to connect with Jesus

121
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,320
 to renew my mind and my perspective

122
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,960
 so that I can bring joy into my being

123
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,760
 and that I can pass on joy to people around me.

124
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,480
 Now, there are practical ways

125
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,200
 that we can pass on our love for people,

126
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,680
 our values, and our hopes, and our dreams.

127
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,520
 I just came across three consecutive couples

128
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,320
 here in the Vine who are in the process

129
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,520
 of adopting children into their own household.

130
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,560
 What a tremendous blessing that shall be

131
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,440
 mutually for each other as parents

132
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,200
 and as adopted children.

133
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,320
 They are passing on amazing love

134
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,360
 modeled from our heavenly Father

135
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,040
 who calls each and every one of us into a family.

136
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,720
 And I also admire my college mate

137
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,960
 who quit his headmaster job to lead an organization

138
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,360
 that is responsible to write up

139
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,840
 all the religious studies curriculum

140
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,560
 here in the public schools in Hong Kong,

141
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,320
 both the primary and the secondaries.

142
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,320
 So he's passing on biblical values

143
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,720
 to our very next generation.

144
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,080
 And he bridged many local churches,

145
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,800
 including the Yun Long Vine Church,

146
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
 to participate in the program.

147
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,720
 Many congregants over there volunteer

148
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,320
 as mentors in these schools.

149
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,040
 And along the way, with diligence and wisdom

150
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,920
 and respect to the Hong Kong education system,

151
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,880
 they brought many school students to Christ.

152
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,960
 What do you want to pass on to people around you?

153
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,600
 While it is still early part of the year,

154
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,040
 how would you like to begin this year?

155
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,640
 And I shall continue today's sharing

156
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,240
 on beginning and end.

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
 In a nutshell,

158
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,400
 every beginning is the end of another beginning.

159
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,160
 And every beginning should be aiming

160
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
 towards a predetermined end.

161
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,680
 Well, we may draw our reference from Hebrews,

162
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,440
 where we are asked to fix our eyes on Jesus,

163
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,960
 the pioneer and perfecter of faith.

164
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,880
 The root word of pioneer in Greek

165
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,960
 is in fact that of akhi,

166
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,360
 our key word today, beginnings.

167
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,040
 Whereas perfecter is rooted in the Greek word telos,

168
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,540
 the end.

169
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,160
 So Jesus indeed see us through the beginning.

170
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,760
 To the end.

171
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,280
 Let us throw off everything that hinders

172
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,880
 and the sin that so easily entangles.

173
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,440
 And let us run with perseverance

174
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,520
 the very race marked out for us,

175
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,920
 fixing our eye on Jesus,

176
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,920
 the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.

177
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,000
 We have been talking about passing on,

178
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
 but paradoxically,

179
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,680
 sometimes new beginnings is about closure of the past.

180
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
 Let's refer to the gospel of Mark

181
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,200
 to look at this interesting interaction

182
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,080
 between endings and beginnings.

183
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,960
 The beginning of the good news about Jesus,

184
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,640
 the Messiah, the son of God.

185
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,120
 As Jesus walked beside the sea of Galilee,

186
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
 he saw Simon and his brother Andrew

187
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,120
 casting a net into the lake,

188
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,160
 for they were fishermen.

189
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,320
 Come, follow me,

190
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,760
 and I will make you out to fish for people.

191
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,920
 At once, they left their nest and followed him.

192
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,960
 This is a call for a new beginning,

193
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,080
 but it actually begins with the closure

194
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,000
 of a prior chapter for Peter and the first disciples.

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,760
 The very first act of Jesus' ministry in Mark's gospel

196
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,560
 is not a spectacular miracle or a great sermon.

197
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,080
 It begins as a simple call

198
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,120
 to for ordinary people to follow him.

199
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,760
 A call for ordinary people like us to follow him.

200
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
 The sea of Galilee is a beautiful lake.

201
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
 In the first century,

202
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,400
 the staple of food in the Greek Roman world

203
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,880
 is fish, not meat per se.

204
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,840
 The fishing industry in the sea of Galilee

205
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,240
 is so prosperous that the cash was not only consumed

206
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,440
 by the local market,

207
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,480
 but also as far as like Antioch in Syria

208
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,800
 or the Alessandra in Egypt.

209
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,680
 So the fishermen of Galilee competed

210
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,560
 in the larger Mediterranean market,

211
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,240
 demonstrating their skill

212
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,640
 and probably their mastery of Greek,

213
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,320
 the common language of commerce and culture in those days.

214
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,040
 The fishermen Jesus called

215
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,760
 were not necessarily just ordinary,

216
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,000
 dispensable day labourers.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,680
 To survive in the market,

218
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,200
 they need to be savvy

219
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,640
 and are probably successful small businessmen.

220
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,280
 Are the background of this first generation disciples

221
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,720
 somewhat like many of us here?

222
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,440
 We work hard in our society

223
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,160
 with our skills in our respective professions.

224
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,040
 Others are working in a booming or challenging business.

225
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,440
 Many of us are bilingual

226
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
 and some of us are even engaged in international trade.

227
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,520
 Is Jesus also calling some of us

228
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,680
 or even all of us who happen to be here in this city,

229
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,000
 but yet by his divine purpose?

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
 But to start with,

231
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,600
 there needs to be some closure to prior chapters.

232
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,360
 The cross is laid on every Christian.

233
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,000
 The very first Christ suffering in following him,

234
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,640
 which every believer needs to go through,

235
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,680
 need to experience,

236
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,480
 is a call to abandon the attachments of this world.

237
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
 As we embark on following him,

238
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,720
 we surrender ourselves to Christ

239
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,880
 in union with his death.

240
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,520
 We give over our lives.

241
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,360
 Thus it begins.

242
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,440
 The cross meets us at the beginning of our journey with him.

243
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,360
 Bonhoeffer wrote in this famous book,

244
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,880
 "The Cause of Discipleship,"

245
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
 very heavy words.

246
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,160
 When Christ calls a man,

247
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,360
 he bids him come and die.

248
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,200
 Following Jesus is a costly and serious matter.

249
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,920
 Our beginning starts with letting go of the past.

250
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,200
 Or the old.

251
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,880
 It's a kind of death and a picking up of our cross.

252
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,080
 I shared a very similar challenge almost 40 years ago,

253
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,280
 but with a very dissimilar choice from that of the disciples.

254
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,480
 At the time I was about to enter into medical schools.

255
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,560
 And that particular summer before the school actually starts,

256
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,240
 the theme of the church camp was

257
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,720
 none other than

258
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,880
 "Surrender yourself to serve."

259
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,820
 Wow.

260
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,680
 I hesitate to embrace that call.

261
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,200
 And I would not like to end my chapter and my career,

262
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,120
 which has not even started.

263
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,680
 I wrestled,

264
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,240
 but I made a subtle decision.

265
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,840
 Maybe this call is not for me.

266
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,080
 And if anything,

267
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,560
 that should be responded to some years down the road.

268
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,200
 Very sadly,

269
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,280
 that deferral to some years down the road to avail myself

270
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,000
 turned out to become decades.

271
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,320
 I detoured.

272
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,280
 I backslided.

273
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,640
 I wondered what my path could have been

274
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,120
 if I had made a different response to the call at the time.

275
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,920
 One never really knows.

276
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,160
 But as I've just shared,

277
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,560
 that chapter has closed,

278
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,600
 be it a bad or a good choice.

279
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,080
 Fast forward,

280
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,440
 I've been attending this church for the past 16 years,

281
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,760
 and I've served as an elder at the Divine Church for the past nine years.

282
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,040
 I still remember the first time that on a hot summer evening,

283
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,400
 without air conditioning,

284
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,200
 in this auditorium,

285
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,640
 which was not done with its renovation,

286
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,560
 that we attended the very first worship service.

287
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,560
 The auditorium was as hot as a hot furnace,

288
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,480
 but our enthusiasm drove us to complete the renovation.

289
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,840
 I also remember in the early days,

290
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,320
 we were very short of funds.

291
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,120
 We didn't even have enough cash flow

292
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,960
 to pay our employees' monthly salaries.

293
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,200
 So we knelt,

294
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,760
 we confessed our sins,

295
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,320
 and we prayed for the Lord's favour.

296
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,840
 It was through the faithfulness of this community,

297
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,960
 the congregation,

298
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,400
 that sometime down the road,

299
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,960
 we were able to pay off all the debts

300
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,520
 and we remained financially stable.

301
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,280
 And we have also witnessed incredible growth

302
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,440
 beyond our imagination,

303
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,840
 with more than 2,400 people

304
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,280
 attending four Sunday services for a season.

305
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,400
 Yet, we went through the challenges

306
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,200
 of the social movements and the COVID restrictions.

307
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,600
 After COVID, the attendance of the Divine Church at Wan Chai

308
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,280
 dropped to an average of 1,500.

309
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,440
 So we were pondering,

310
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,120
 where shall we go?

311
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,880
 Yet, it was in this difficult moment

312
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,960
 our very first church plant at Yuen Long was birthed.

313
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,560
 Praise God!

314
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,160
 So on that personal level,

315
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,720
 serving as an elder and chairman of the board

316
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,520
 through this season

317
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,160
 has been a life-changing experience for me.

318
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,960
 And on behalf of the past eldership board,

319
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,640
 including those who have stepped down

320
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,080
 after serving many years in faithful services,

321
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,280
 and those who are still continuing to serve

322
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,160
 in the current board,

323
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,680
 I want to thank you

324
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,280
 because you allow us to serve

325
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,320
 in areas of spiritual guidance,

326
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,360
 organisational governance,

327
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,800
 financial prudence,

328
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,000
 and corporate leadership.

329
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,720
 For myself, having to step down

330
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,280
 according to the rule of congregation

331
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
 could be a blessing in disguise.

332
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,640
 I did receive the word,

333
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,320
 "New wine in new wine skin."

334
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,880
 For anything new to happen,

335
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,280
 there has to be an end to the prior chapter.

336
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,880
 How I may serve in the next season

337
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,920
 is something that God will continue to reveal.

338
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,680
 God willing,

339
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,360
 I do hope that there will be future opportunities

340
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
 that I may stand on this pulpit

341
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,680
 to share God's word with all of you.

342
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,640
 Paul proudly say at the end of a season of serving,

343
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,680
 "I have fought the good fight.

344
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,240
 I have finished the race.

345
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,920
 I have kept the faith."

346
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,800
 However, sometimes we don't wrap up our past properly.

347
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,480
 How do we know that we didn't end well?

348
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,120
 Well, that's when we can't stop thinking about the past

349
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,160
 and we keep on chewing the hurtful experience.

350
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,600
 We felt angry and frustrated

351
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,560
 because of the sadness or pain in our life

352
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,800
 and we struggled to encounter God

353
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,960
 in those difficult moments.

354
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,680
 And we declined to enter into new commitments

355
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,760
 in life, in relationships, or in ministries.

356
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,040
 Just now one of the congregation members shared with me,

357
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
 "Well, maybe for this season,

358
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,000
 there are some amongst us who are in depression,

359
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,400
 in mental illnesses, or in emotional turmoil.

360
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,000
 You struggle and you want it to come to a closure.

361
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,200
 Yet God's promises is he will bring it to an end."

362
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,720
 But for myself, somewhere last year,

363
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,080
 when I no longer received the honorary academic title

364
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,120
 conferred to me by the university all over the years,

365
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
 I was really upset.

366
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,520
 I thought, well, I had made very significant contributions.

367
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,400
 I thought I had mentored many and inspired others.

368
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,480
 The list kept on going.

369
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,880
 But then I come to my senses.

370
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,280
 I've left the academic field for a good number of years.

371
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,760
 A closure is a closure.

372
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,920
 I can choose to embrace my new role as peers to my colleagues,

373
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,280
 including those who are younger than myself

374
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,240
 but who may be brighter or even more skillful.

375
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,320
 I can choose to fully commit myself to patient care on personal levels.

376
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,360
 And I can explore new ventures in life.

377
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,120
 It will be helpful for us, therefore,

378
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,440
 to consider the features of emotionally healthy endings and new beginnings.

379
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
 Healthy endings and new beginnings.

380
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,240
 That we are fully aware that the transition,

381
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,160
 waiting for ending and the confusion in between,

382
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,440
 could be much longer than we imagine.

383
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,240
 And we have to realise that ending and the waiting

384
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,720
 are closely tied to a personal maturity in Christ.

385
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,080
 And we are to firmly believe that endings and waiting

386
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,560
 are the gateway to new beginnings.

387
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,160
 If we accept these losses, whether it's work-related,

388
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,120
 a relationship that comes to an end,

389
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,240
 or even a failed ministry, a sickness,

390
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,560
 God will work profoundly in and through us

391
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,080
 in the way that the Apostle Paul describes.

392
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,720
 So then, death is at work in us,

393
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,160
 but life is at work in you.

394
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,520
 Even Jesus says, "Very truly I tell you,

395
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,160
 "a canal of wheat which falls to the ground and dies,

396
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,480
 "it remains only a single seed.

397
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,880
 "But if it dies, it produces many seeds.

398
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,920
 "If that seed dies, it produces many seeds."

399
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:12,320
 I wonder whether you understand how cancer progression means.

400
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,360
 In short, cancer cells do not complete

401
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,800
 their original life cycle at the appropriate time,

402
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,920
 okay, according to normal life design.

403
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,160
 But instead, they become vicious cells that drag on

404
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,720
 and incorporate their endangered life.

405
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,640
 When I was diagnosed with leukaemia some years ago,

406
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,840
 the idea of the target treatment that I received

407
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,840
 was to let the medicine create an environment

408
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,880
 for these cells to die,

409
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,360
 so that healthy cells can reappear in the future.

410
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,080
 I literally died when I received the treatment.

411
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,200
 I thought I was dying.

412
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,520
 Well, but here I am.

413
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,080
 I'm reasonably well, strong, and healthy.

414
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,680
 Maybe we should all ask ourselves,

415
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,720
 if I accept this ending of my current life situation,

416
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,440
 what new things might be standing in the background,

417
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,560
 waiting to come into my personal life?

418
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,800
 When we face the end of a chapter in our lives,

419
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,520
 God's will is not just there to change

420
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,040
 our external environment.

421
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,840
 He's doing something greater,

422
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,440
 initiating a deeper transformation within us

423
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,240
 that goes beyond our imagination.

424
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,440
 I love this quote from Parker Palmer.

425
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,480
 "On the spiritual journey, each time a door closes,

426
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,360
 the rest of the world opens up,

427
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,400
 and all we need to do is to stop pounding on the door

428
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,840
 that has just closed.

429
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,520
 Turn around."

430
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,360
 I say, "Turn around."

431
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,680
 Yeah, because that's where you see the door opens.

432
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,520
 The closed door is behind us,

433
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,640
 but we welcome the largeness of life

434
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,840
 that now lies open to our souls.

435
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,120
 So don't pound on the closed door.

436
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,600
 Embrace the new.

437
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,840
 How should we embark on a new journey?

438
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,920
 Stephen Covey teaches us in his best-selling book,

439
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,800
 "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People."

440
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,840
 One of the habits is paradoxically,

441
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,800
 begin with the end in mind.

442
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,800
 While he might have pause and encouragement in mind

443
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,240
 when he writes his book,

444
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,880
 I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it.

445
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,320
 But one thing I do,

446
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,080
 forgetting what is behind

447
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,960
 and straining towards what is ahead.

448
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,920
 I press on towards the goal.

449
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,360
 In this chapter, Stephen challenges us to imagine

450
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
 that we are attending our own funeral.

451
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,340
 So sad.

452
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,980
 (audience laughs)

453
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,980
 But then we shall hear from our family,

454
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,500
 our friends, our colleagues,

455
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,940
 and our fellow congregants,

456
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,780
 how they remember us.

457
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,740
 This is indeed a challenge.

458
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,820
 More often, we like to ask questions,

459
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,660
 well, what we want to accomplish by the end of 2025.

460
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:26,820
 How would I like my family to be in three years' time?

461
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,780
 Or what I expect my ministry to be doing in five years?

462
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,660
 Maybe slightly longer down the road,

463
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,260
 when I retire, what kind of legacy will I leave behind?

464
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,580
 We can and we should set short-term goals

465
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,020
 on the way to long-term life goals.

466
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,140
 But the author reminds us to focus on the ultimate goals

467
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,260
 that really matter,

468
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:57,540
 lest we lean our leather against the wrong wall.

469
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,460
 I try to practice this principle in my own life,

470
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,380
 for the past decade or so,

471
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,180
 every five years, we organize a gathering of family,

472
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,620
 of friends, co-workers, and church members

473
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,020
 to celebrate our birthdays or wedding anniversaries.

474
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,260
 So some seven or eight years ago,

475
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,300
 we celebrated our 21st wedding anniversary.

476
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,500
 But we also took a bold step

477
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,620
 to break the news to our guests

478
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,780
 that I was suffering from leukemia.

479
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,060
 And I was about to start my treatment.

480
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:38,020
 I was charting into the unknown waters.

481
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,620
 So I also kind of took it as a farewell,

482
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,220
 in case the treatment didn't go well.

483
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:50,180
 Fast forward in our recent 60th birthday party,

484
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,060
 we asked our guests to share something

485
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,140
 that they would like to say about us,

486
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,100
 both as an encouragement

487
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,100
 and as a measure of whether we have passed on something

488
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,420
 worth remembering to them.

489
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,220
 If we think deeply about it,

490
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:12,660
 how I do, how I want these relatives and friends

491
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,100
 to evaluate my life.

492
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,260
 What kind of husband, wife, father, or mother

493
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,340
 do we want them to remember?

494
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,580
 What kind of friends,

495
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,620
 what kind of work partner are we for them?

496
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,940
 What qualities do I want them to see in me?

497
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,140
 What contributions, what achievements

498
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,500
 do I want them to remember?

499
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,660
 Or maybe the penultimate question should be,

500
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,620
 will I be called the good and faithful servant

501
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:50,020
 that I may be invited to Jesus' banquet

502
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,620
 to celebrate together?

503
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,700
 If I look closely at the people around me,

504
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,980
 what change do I want to make in their lives?

505
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,900
 So if my ultimate goal is to see the transformation

506
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,340
 in the lives of others,

507
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,260
 I should start with my personal choices,

508
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,860
 my priorities, and my life as a believer.

509
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,540
 When Jesus first called Peter,

510
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,940
 he already had an end in mind for Peter.

511
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,340
 It's a call to ministry.

512
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,580
 Jesus said, "Follow me, I will make you fishers of men."

513
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,860
 The Greek wording is, "I will make you fishers of men."

514
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,100
 The original Greek has a sense of make changes

515
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,700
 so that one becomes.

516
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,180
 It is a dual process, and it took three years for Peter.

517
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,660
 A call can indeed completely change our destiny.

518
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,060
 About 20 years ago, when I was still living in Singapore,

519
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,820
 I received a call from Hong Kong.

520
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,380
 That was the invitation for me

521
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,300
 to join one of the local universities.

522
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,660
 And we decided to take up that challenge

523
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,900
 for me professionally and for the family

524
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,740
 to start a new life again

525
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,700
 after a 10-year stay in Singapore.

526
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,900
 Well, it is a beginning, a new beginning for me

527
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,140
 where my goal, my end goal, is to leave a legacy

528
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,260
 or at least to make a difference.

529
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,100
 And that call changed the trajectory of my life.

530
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,180
 Got a wonderful plan.

531
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,500
 When we returned to Hong Kong

532
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,260
 and we were looking for a church,

533
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,420
 we stumbled into Divine Church.

534
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,180
 We were still meeting in Central at the time.

535
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,220
 Vivian and I had the wonderful privilege

536
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,420
 to serve in this church,

537
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,340
 especially in the Chinese ministry.

538
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,020
 That should be considered a surprising

539
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,740
 and almost unexpected call, right?

540
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,060
 How about Peter?

541
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,700
 What happened to him upon his saying yes

542
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,940
 to the first call by Jesus?

543
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,100
 Did he continue to keep his end in mind

544
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,220
 while riding the many ups and downs?

545
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,620
 After three years of working with Jesus,

546
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,900
 Peter, along with all the other disciples,

547
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,780
 entered into a new chapter

548
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,980
 where they will continue to spread the good news

549
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,980
 in Jesus' absence

550
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,500
 because Jesus will soon leave them.

551
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,060
 They are about to begin their own new era.

552
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,220
 Jesus promised, "When the Advocate comes,

553
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,340
 "home I will send to you from the Father,

554
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,860
 "the Spirit of Truth who goes out from the Father.

555
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,340
 "He will testify about me

556
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:47,460
 "and you will also testify

557
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,420
 "for you have been with me from the beginning."

558
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:55,300
 A long circle, and we are back to the beginning.

559
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,620
 Peter and first disciples had the privilege

560
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,100
 of being in fellowship with Jesus

561
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,780
 from the very beginning,

562
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,540
 and they had a unique calling.

563
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,940
 You might have been attending Divine

564
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,140
 for the past three years,

565
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,220
 or maybe just three months,

566
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,980
 or even three weeks,

567
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,380
 or you might have been with us from the beginning.

568
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,900
 Regardless, we are blessed to be part

569
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,580
 of a new season for this church.

570
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,180
 We will be part of a new beginning,

571
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,940
 which Andrew will speak to us more

572
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,460
 on the Vision Sunday just next week.

573
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,780
 God values us.

574
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,940
 May we spread the good news

575
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,140
 and keep in mind the end goal.

576
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,140
 Which is citywide life transformation

577
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:49,060
 in Wan Chai and Yun Long and beyond.

578
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:53,780
 Jesus' final instructions to his disciples

579
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,660
 at that time are the same instructions

580
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,820
 to us here today.

581
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,020
 You, you must bear witness

582
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,740
 because you have been with Jesus

583
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,700
 from the beginning.

584
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,020
 Our context may differ,

585
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,380
 but we are all in a new beginning

586
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,980
 that God has ordained.

587
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,660
 The New Testament ends beautifully.

588
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,340
 Revelation says,

589
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,700
 "I am the Alpha and the Omega,

590
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,940
 "the first and the last,

591
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,660
 "the beginning and the end."

592
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,180
 Achi and Telos,

593
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,940
 "the beginning and the end."

594
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,540
 I hope that as we celebrate a new season

595
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,060
 for our faith community,

596
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,700
 each of us would move towards our life goal.

597
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:49,300
 And my life goal is to give the best of myself

598
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,380
 to serve him in whatever years to come.

599
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,780
 May Divine Church continue to head towards

600
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,300
 what Jesus Christ has destined for us.

601
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,380
 Keep moving towards our goal

602
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,740
 so that the gospel and the kingdom of heaven

603
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,940
 can continue to be passed on.

604
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,660
 Shall we ask God to speak to us collectively

605
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,100
 and as individuals,

606
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,300
 that we hear our call distinctly

607
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,180
 and that we shall follow him boldly.

608
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,100
 Can I invite the worship team?

609
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:29,300
 I would also like to invite all of us to stand.

610
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,220
 I think there's a precious moment

611
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,660
 that we can commit our endings

612
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,780
 and our new beginnings to Jesus.

613
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,420
 So if in the sharing just now,

614
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,180
 you desire to have a closure to your past,

615
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,380
 whether it's a sickness,

616
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,780
 whether it's a relationship,

617
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,140
 whether it's a failure,

618
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,460
 whatever it is,

619
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,700
 ask God to help you close that chapter gracefully.

620
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,340
 If you want to respond to God,

621
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,100
 to head for a new beginning,

622
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,060
 say yes to Jesus.

623
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,060
 Come and invite Jesus to journey with you.

624
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,460
 And if you do want to pass on a blessing,

625
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,860
 including a personal salvation

626
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,940
 that had been bestowed upon you,

627
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,860
 ask God to help you pass it on.

628
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,500
 Shall we pray?

629
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,700
 Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you

630
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,100
 because as we fix our eyes onto you,

631
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,980
 our pioneer and perfecter of faith,

632
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,060
 the beginning and the end.

633
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,420
 And we thank you because you see us through.

634
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,860
 Help us to hear your call so clearly and distinctly.

635
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,700
 Help us to close our closure so gracefully.

636
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,260
 Help us to say yes to your call

637
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,180
 and start our new beginnings

638
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,100
 and help us to follow you

639
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,260
 and that we may be able to pass on

640
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,060
 whatever you have bestowed upon us,

641
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,220
 blessings and your salvation.

642
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,700
 In Jesus' name, amen.

643
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,200
 Amen.
