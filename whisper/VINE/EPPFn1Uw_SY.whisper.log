[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]   Father, we thank you for this.
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.080]   We praise you for it.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.320]   In Jesus' name, everyone says, amen.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.360]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.920]   We're continuing our series in Ephesians here this morning, and as we do so, we come to
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.340]   what I consider the pivot passage in the whole of the book.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.120]   There's a saying that says that big huge doors swing on small hinges, and we're only going
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.720]   to be looking at, say, four verses of text this morning, but a big huge door swings on
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.040]   just this small hinge we're going to be looking at.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.440]   This pivot passage is found right in the heart of Paul's letter to his church in Ephesus.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.320]   If you were with us in the first week, you would have heard me talk about how I think
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.200]   Paul structures the letter into two halves.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.560]   There's the half of grace and the half of peace.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.160]   The first three chapters is Paul's way of sort of saying, here's all the things that
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.560]   Christ has done in his grace.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.720]   The first three chapters are a theological treatise of the grace and the wonder and the
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.560]   power of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.800]   It's one of the most profound things, and over the last number of weeks of this series,
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.320]   we've preached through almost verse by verse all the things that Paul is teaching to his
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.560]   church about the grace of Christ.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.520]   It's a deep and rich theology.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.440]   But he's about to now move into the second half of the letter from chapters four to six,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.360]   where he's going to talk about peace and what it's like to now live out of this grace that
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.480]   he's just talked about.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.640]   He's going to challenge them with some pretty tough words.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.920]   He's going to talk about what it is to be in marriage, what it is to be parents, what
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.920]   it is to be children.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.560]   He's going to talk about the unity that he's expecting to see in the church.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.560]   He's going to talk about the need for the armor of God so that we can be equipped and
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.400]   fully ready for all the attacks that are going to happen in the spiritual realm out there.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.440]   He's got some pretty important things to say about practical Christian living, but he's
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.720]   finding himself in the passage we're looking at this week between the two.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.260]   It's like he said, here's all the stuff that Christ has done.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.520]   That's how you should now live.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.080]   But before we get there, we need to stop.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.080]   And Paul realizes before he gets to what he wants to say in chapters four to six, he has
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.080]   to first pray.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.760]   And he has to pray because Paul understands that there is no way we can move from a theology
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.040]   to a living out in the way that Paul has a vision for his church without that being a
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.560]   sovereign move of God.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.960]   It's got to be the work of the spirit.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.000]   All the theology that he's just talked about, as important as that is, as important as good,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.560]   sound, doctrine is, it's not going to do much to help us to move into being the people of
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   God.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.960]   He realizes that's a move of the spirit.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.640]   That's got to be a move of the heart of God, restoring and changing his people.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.240]   And so he's like, before I get there, we need to stop and you need to let me pray for you,
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.620]   he's saying to the church.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.520]   You need to let me pray for you because this is not a work of me.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.880]   It's not a work of a pastor.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.240]   This is not a work of a church.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.440]   The only way this is going to happen is if the spirit of God does something that I cannot
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.720]   do, Paul is saying to the church.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.480]   So before we get on to talking about all this stuff, we first have to pray.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:42.520]   We have to ask that God would come in his power and transform us from the inside out,
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.520]   he says.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.140]   Oh, look at all this crazy, beautiful grace that Christ has given us.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.160]   Look at how we should live.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:59.020]   But if it doesn't happen in here, none of it is worth anything.
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.360]   Paul understands that we have to be encountered before we can be an encounter.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.600]   He knows that we have to be deeply transformed before we can hope to be a transforming agent
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.780]   of the spirit of God in the world.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.860]   And so he prays and boy, does he pray.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.700]   He prays one of the most passionate, one of the most heartfelt, one of the most deepest,
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.560]   most profound prayers that we find in the whole of the New Testament.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.140]   Because for Paul, this is where the rubber hits the road.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.060]   This is where life really matters.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.000]   And he desperately wants to see his church alive.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.420]   This is the pastoral presence of Paul for his people.
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.180]   Oh, if only Christ would come and fill you with his love.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.680]   I'm also quite passionate about this prayer in case you haven't realized so far.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.700]   And the reason being is because everything that Paul prays in this prayer is exactly
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.300]   what would be on my heart for you here at the Vine.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.760]   In fact, our whole vision here at the Vine, which is growing big people, the idea that
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.740]   whether you're with us for two weeks, two months, two years, two decades, we want you
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.580]   to grow in Christ Jesus, we want you to mature in your relationship with him so that you
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.600]   can come to the full measure of the fullness of Christ as Paul's about to teach us in Ephesians
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   4.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.940]   But before he gets there, before we get there in this series, we have to pause and we have
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.460]   to realize that the prayer that he prays captures the heart of that vision.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.800]   Without this prayer, that vision is nothing.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.560]   With this prayer, that vision can come.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.940]   This is why funnily enough I'm emotionally connected to this today because at the very
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.980]   first Sunday that I became senior pastor, the 3rd of November 2013, it was this passage
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.460]   that I chose to preach from.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.380]   And I preached from this passage because it was a summary of my heart to you at the church.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.100]   And some 11 years later as I'm unpacking this for myself again over the last month or so
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.660]   as I'm preparing for this message, that same heart resonates inside of me.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.380]   If there's one thing I want for you, it is these verses that we're looking at here today.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.260]   And so as we teach this, as I open it up, as I do my best to perhaps show you what I
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.860]   think was on Paul's heart for his church and you get a glimpse of what I think is on God's
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.060]   heart for you, my prayer is that this isn't just some teaching.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.380]   My prayer is that there is an impartation that takes place for you from the heart of
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.220]   the Father for what he has in your life.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.100]   I believe that there is so much of what Ellison spoke about just a moment ago, this idea of
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.300]   him coming and meeting us in our hearts that he wants for us.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.620]   This is why we do the Vine.
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.780]   Not so you would come here and be tickled in your ears and entertained on a Sunday,
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.180]   but so that the Spirit of God would transform you from the inside out.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.180]   Amen?
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.140]   So I want to read you this prayer, but I'm going to do it in a way that we don't normally
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.140]   do here.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.180]   I want to actually pray it over you.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.780]   I'd love for you to stand with me.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.820]   Would you stand?
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.900]   And if you're comfortable, I'd invite you just to close your eyes and you can open your
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:15.940]   hands before you because this is Paul's prayer for his church, but it is also our prayer
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.100]   for you.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:25.860]   For this reason, I kneel before the Father from whom his whole family in heaven and on
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.020]   earth derives its name.
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.620]   And here's what I pray.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:37.260]   I pray that out of his glorious riches, he may strengthen you with power through his
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.020]   spirit in your inner being.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.120]   I'm going to pray that again for you.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.620]   This is what we want for you here at the Vine.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:52.260]   We pray that out of God's glorious riches, he may strengthen you with the power through
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:59.780]   his spirit in your inner being so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:06.080]   And we pray that you who are rooted and established in love may have the power together with everybody
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:13.540]   in this room to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ and to
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:19.860]   know this love that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled to the fullness, the full
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.980]   measure of the fullness of God.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:29.140]   In Jesus' name, everyone says, have a seat.
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.740]   When was the last time somebody prayed that prayer, a prayer like that over you?
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.700]   When was the last time you prayed a prayer like that?
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.900]   When was the last time I prayed a prayer like that?
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:44.140]   What a stunning heart, pastoral heart Paul has for his people.
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.180]   I love how he begins the prayer.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.940]   He does something that was not done in that time.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:54.780]   He says, "I bow my knee," or "I get on my knees before the Father."
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:00.300]   Now, here in modern Christianity days, we think about being on our knees in prayer all
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.300]   the time.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:06.700]   It's a very common thing in our time, but in the first century, it was a very uncommon
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.700]   thing.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.600]   In fact, prayer, whether that was in the temple or whether that was actually done in the house
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:17.020]   churches at the time, prayer was predominantly done standing and standing with your arms
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.460]   stretched out towards the heavens.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:25.300]   In fact, as a leader of the temple or a leader in the church, this was the posture you prayed.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.580]   Jesus spoke about this when he gave the parable of the tax collector and the Pharisee coming
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.000]   into the temple to pray.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.200]   They're both pictured standing before the Lord, and they're raising their hands out,
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.640]   and they're acknowledging a confidence and a faith and a trust in God.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.780]   That was the posture.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:47.620]   But Paul flips it on its head, and he does something that was rare and was hardly spoken
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.900]   about, hardly done in that time.
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.900]   He gets on his knees.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:59.420]   Now, Paul does this because he has a deep and rich theological understanding of the
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.420]   Old Testament.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.140]   Remember, he was a Hebrew of Hebrews, a Pharisee of Pharisees before he came to know Christ.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.060]   And his deep rooting in the Old Testament understanding of scripture and theology roots
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.980]   him even in this prayer.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.980]   It's fascinating.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.700]   In the Old Testament, the word "bless" is the Hebrew word "barak."
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.740]   And "barak" actually comes in a number of different forms.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:26.980]   In one particular form, "barak" actually is better translated to "break yourself down"
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.220]   or to "bend your knee."
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.000]   It's a posture of humility and surrender.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.380]   One of the most famous places in the Old Testament that the word is used that way is Psalm 103
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.420]   verse 1, where it says, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.140]   Bless His holy name."
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.220]   When we normally read that, we think of this as a worship psalm, as a proclamation psalm,
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.780]   as if the psalmist is standing there with his hands open to the heavens and saying,
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.600]   "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   Bless His holy name."
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.340]   In other words, worship and praise Him.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:03.900]   But actually, the word "barak" here is in the cognate form that means to bend the knee.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.700]   Here is what the psalmist is actually saying.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:12.220]   He's saying, "Bend the knee, O my soul, and all that is within me.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.580]   Bend the knee to His holy name."
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.860]   In other words, this is a psalm not of worship.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.780]   It's a psalm of holy surrender.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:28.820]   It's a psalm of recognizing that we are nothing before the holiness of God.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.700]   Paul starts his prayer in an uncommon posture.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.940]   He blesses the Lord at the start by bending his knee.
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:44.980]   And what he's saying is, "God, this has nothing to do with me.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:50.220]   I may be the pastor over these people in this church in Ephesus, but this has nothing to
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.220]   do with me.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.220]   It's not about my strength.
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.020]   It's not about my theology.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.340]   It's not about everything I know.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.600]   I bend my knee.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:04.240]   Everything within me bends itself now to You because only You can do what I'm about to
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.520]   pray.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.140]   There's no strength within me.
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.220]   There's no ability that I have.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:15.660]   Nothing can actually happen in my church the way that I long to see it happen unless, God,
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.460]   there's a sovereign move of Your Spirit so I will get on my knees."
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:26.460]   This is a radical thing because he was expected to be standing and bold and strong, offering
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.140]   confidence before the Lord.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:35.240]   And he says, "Before the whole church, I declare I am nothing."
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:42.900]   He then prays to the Father, to the Father, which again in our New Testament kind of Christian
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.660]   sense in this modern day and age, we understand that.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.820]   But again, in his time, he's rooting that back to the Old Testament.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.420]   We actually learned this in the Exodus series last year where we saw that the first time
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.820]   God refers to Himself as a Father is in Exodus chapter 4 where He's speaking through Moses
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.260]   and Aaron to speak to Pharaoh for the first time.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.660]   And in that passage, He actually says, "Israel is My son."
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:11.380]   It's the first time that God actually uses the metaphor as a Father over His people Israel.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.940]   He declares that they are His son, making Him the Father of that nation.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.060]   Now, here's the interesting thing.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:24.620]   This happens just one chapter after Moses has come to God at the burning bush and said,
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.780]   "What is Your name?
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.180]   How do I refer to You?
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.660]   How do I understand You?"
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.700]   And in that moment, God says, "I am that I am."
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:42.620]   The famous sacred name of God for the Jewish people is spoken in that time.
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.100]   We come to understand that as Yahweh.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.900]   It's the L-O-R-D in capital letters in your Old Testament.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.620]   Anytime you read that in your Old Testament, it's actually the sacred name that's being
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.020]   spoken this Yahweh.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.620]   I want to show you how it's spelt in the Hebrew.
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.280]   It's spelt like this.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.480]   They are two consonants.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.940]   And these particular consonants are very unique in the Hebrew language.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.340]   They're the only two consonants that when pronounced properly do not require you to
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.500]   move your mouth or to move your tongue.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:23.340]   And they're specifically designed that way to be used in the sacred name so that when
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:30.200]   the sacred name is spoken, it's almost like you're inhaling and exhaling.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.020]   It's almost like it's breath.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:49.140]   Let me demonstrate by trying to pronounce it as best I can like this.
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.140]   Can you hear it?
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.460]   Okay, I want you all, don't move your mouth, don't move your tongue.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.660]   I want you all now, breathe in, breathe out.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.300]   Keep going.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.300]   Keep going.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.300]   Stop.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.300]   People are not doing it.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.300]   Okay, we're going to try it again.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.900]   We're all going to do it.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.460]   Honestly, this will blow your mind.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:20.460]   Breathe in.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.900]   Can you hear it?
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:29.860]   The sacred name of the Lord, Yahweh, designed specifically to be like breath of which links
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:35.020]   in the Old Testament to His name, which Paul now links to Him being a father, which is
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:44.620]   why he says every family on earth derives its name from this Father.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:50.780]   Because the very first word that ever came out of you was the sacred name of God.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:56.300]   And the very last word that will ever come out of you before you die will be the sacred
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.120]   name of God.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:06.540]   Your first breath, your last breath, you declared.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:11.180]   And Paul is on his knees before his church, and he knows the importance of what he's about
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.220]   to pray.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:18.820]   And it's like he takes a breath.
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:25.940]   And he centers himself before the Father of who everybody derives His name.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:33.080]   Anything that has ever taken its breath, connected to the One who is the sacred name, the I am
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.740]   that I am, the Lord Yahweh, we're connected in through that.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:43.740]   And he takes a moment, humble before his church, breathing in, breathing out, to then pray
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.740]   something for them.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.180]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.740]   Can you get a sense of Paul's pastoral heart for his people?
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.020]   He's like, we're all connected to this God.
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.500]   We've been connected from the very beginning.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.760]   We're still connected.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.900]   And here's what I pray that this God would do.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:08.660]   He says, I pray that out of His glorious riches, He would strengthen you with power through
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.780]   His Spirit in your inner being.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.180]   Is there not any more beautiful verse in the whole Bible than that?
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:23.100]   That He would strengthen you with power in your inner being out of His glorious riches.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:28.820]   Paul starts here by saying this, out of His glorious riches, out of this incredible amount
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.020]   of love, this incredible amount of mercy, this incredible amount of grace, all the stuff
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.580]   that I've just been talking to you about, about how you've been adopted into His family,
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.800]   not because you did anything, but just because He loved you.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.980]   How He went to the cross to die for you, how He resurrected your dead spirit and made you
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.740]   alive by grace, not by works.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.980]   All of that stuff, the glorious riches of a God who is willing to bring Himself to this
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.600]   earth to die on your behalf because He so loves you.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:00.020]   Out of all of that work, I now pray that He would come and do something for you.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:05.220]   Paul does not say, out of my great life, I pray.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.340]   He doesn't say, out of the fact that I'm your pastor, I pray.
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.020]   He doesn't say it's got anything to do with me.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.540]   He says, out of His glorious riches, because I am nothing.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.140]   I'm even in prison.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.820]   He's just told them in chapter three.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:25.220]   He's like, I got nothing to offer you, but I know the glorious riches of Christ are
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:30.820]   overflowing with love, and it's out of the storehouse of His riches that I feel this
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.700]   ability to now pray that He would do something in your life.
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:38.960]   Oh, may that change your prayer life.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:46.180]   You always have a reason to pray out of His glorious riches, out of His glorious riches
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.180]   for you.
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:52.760]   You have to understand that when he's saying this, what he's doing is he's rooting every
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.820]   move of the Spirit out of those glorious riches.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.380]   I mean, think about this for a second.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:03.620]   Any time you have ever encountered the work of the Spirit in your life, it has happened
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:08.660]   for no other reason than the scandalous idea that God loves you.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.540]   Have you thought about that?
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:16.660]   No other reason than the reality of His love for you.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.860]   Any time that there's been a move of the Spirit in your life, any time you've opened the Scriptures
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.940]   and they've come alive, any time that you felt the wind of the Spirit in you, it's because
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:30.540]   He's saying, I love you, I love you, I love you, I chose you, I made you, I formed you.
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.180]   You're not perfect, but I love you.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:42.700]   Out of His glorious riches, you have and are able to make your being.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:48.500]   And out of this place, He says this, He says that you would be strengthened by power through
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.640]   His Spirit in your inner being.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.580]   The idea of being strengthened in power here, it's not talking about, I hope that you'll
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.100]   become a more powerful person.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.340]   He's not getting Caesar or empire imagery here.
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.460]   He's not saying, I hope you become the best banker you could ever be, the best lawyer
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.460]   you could ever be.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.300]   I hope you get much more wealth and prosperity and you enlarge the territory of your influence
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.040]   and you'll be super powered.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:18.100]   When He talks about being strengthened by power, what He's talking about is healing
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.020]   and restoration.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.420]   He's talking about healing and restoration.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.500]   But by the mere fact that He says, my prayer for you out of the glorious riches of Christ
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.420]   is that His Spirit would work in you to strengthen you.
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.740]   What He's saying is all of us have areas of weakness, don't we?
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.380]   He's saying all of our hearts have somewhere where it's weak.
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.100]   Our inner being is weak.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.020]   This is this pastor of Rulhaferi's church.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:48.220]   He's like, I know you and I know that some of you are suffering with shame.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.580]   Some of you are struggling with guilt.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.460]   Some of you are overwhelmed in fear.
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.540]   I can see it in you.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.260]   I can feel it in you, He's saying.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.000]   And so my prayer is that out of the glorious riches of Christ, His Spirit would be at so
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.420]   much work in you that you would be strengthened where you're weak.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.660]   You'd be healed where you're weak.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:10.220]   Right now you're feeling fear, my prayer is that you would know power.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.500]   Where you're feeling pain, my prayer is that you would have a healing and restoration in
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.140]   the area of your heart that feels pain.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:23.220]   My gosh, He's saying that you would only know that the Spirit of God could fill you completely.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:28.140]   Again, He's linking back to Old Testament rooting here.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:33.340]   He's saying, do you realize the move of the Spirit that's happened in redemptive history?
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.260]   At the beginning, the Spirit of God appears to Moses in a bush.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.740]   Then appears to Moses on a mountain, the fullness of God's presence on a mountain.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:46.180]   Then it was found in the tabernacle and God's people would crowd around the tabernacle and
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.500]   witness the power of God inside a tent.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.420]   Once the temple was constructed, it was found in the Holy of Holies within the temple, this
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.900]   powerful sense of God's presence with His people and His people would come into the
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.220]   temple, but they couldn't get too close because of His holiness.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.620]   They had to stand on the outside.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.820]   The only person that could go in was be after a year of sacrifice to get himself ready to
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.220]   get in there.
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.580]   And then the Babylonians come in the sixth century, destroy the temple.
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.740]   God's people are in exile in Babylon.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.420]   Seventy years later, they'll come back out of exile and the prophets begin to speak again
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.480]   of God's Spirit.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.300]   But now it's different.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:27.940]   Where God's Spirit used to be in a mountain and a bush and a tabernacle and in a temple,
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.500]   the prophets begin to speak of a new time.
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.020]   Last example is Ezekiel 36.
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.060]   Let me read this to you.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.780]   "I will give you a new heart and a new spirit in you.
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:42.860]   I will remove from you the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.100]   And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.100]   my laws."
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.860]   Ezekiel says, "A time is coming where God will no longer be on a mountain, in a tabernacle,
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.860]   in a temple.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.440]   He'll be within you."
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:01.420]   And when He's within you, the stone, remember the law was given on the mountain in stone
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:06.180]   - the stone of your heart will become like flesh, He says.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.420]   And here's Paul years later going, "I've had that experience.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.900]   I was on the road to Damascus.
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:17.020]   I was on my way to kill Christians and I was so overwhelmed by the Spirit of God that inside
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.900]   my inner being I was transformed forever."
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:26.260]   He wasn't there in the upper room at Pentecost, but he knows the stories from the disciples
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.940]   and he knew that the Spirit of God had so poured out in power in Pentecost in the upper
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.180]   room that they began to speak in tongues and people came to faith and it was amazing.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.460]   And here's Paul's prayer.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.620]   He's saying, "That's what I want for you.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:47.140]   I want you out of the glorious riches of Christ that you would so know inside of you, you
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:51.420]   would be strengthened with power by the Spirit in your inner being."
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:24:00.260]   He's saying, "Oh man, there is nothing more valuable in the world than that."
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.900]   I love Paul's pastoral prayer for his church.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.540]   Paul does not pray for Johnny to stop smoking.
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.780]   He doesn't pray for Anita to stop worrying.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.820]   He doesn't pray for Jamie to finally deal with his porn habit.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:18.660]   No, no, Paul's actually interested not in the surface of things.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.420]   He's interested in the things that are much deeper than that because he knows that that's
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.080]   where God starts.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.380]   And while it might be important to try to sort out some of those surface things, Paul's
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.140]   not praying for God to show up and give a band-aid to his church.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.940]   He wants God to show up and do surgery in the lives and the heart of his church because
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.500]   he sees their brokenness.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.880]   He sees their pain.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.380]   He sees the hardness of their hearts at times and he knows that he can't do anything about
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.580]   it, but out of the glorious riches of Christ, the Spirit might be able to come and transform
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:59.200]   his church so that they would know that they are so deeply loved and so deeply new people
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:05.620]   in him that their whole lives are changed and they'll probably deal with that porn habit.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:11.340]   Not out of some, "Oh my gosh, I better fix this thing to be a better Christian," but
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:17.460]   out of suddenly a place of, "Oh my gosh, the Lord loves me so deeply.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.220]   He has changed my life.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.300]   How can I not serve him with everything within me?
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:32.060]   In the eyes of my heart, Lord, so that I can see you, be you, live out what Ezekiel was
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:39.420]   talking about here where he says a new heart so that we can live out your law in love,
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.940]   not in some sort of thing."
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:48.100]   So many people think that Christianity is a behavior modification religion.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.340]   That's so many people in the world think that that's what our faith is.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.380]   And to be honest with you, there's a lot of people in the church that think that that's
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.740]   what our faith is as well.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:59.700]   That actually Christianity is all about having something with God and there's rules and regulations
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.700]   and restrictions.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.100]   And if I adhere to the rules, regulations, and restrictions, then I'll be a better person,
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:09.260]   I'll be more loved by God, and I'll be able to succeed more in life.
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.580]   And Paul's saying, "No, no, no, no.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.140]   We've got this all wrong.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.140]   Christianity is not a behavior modification religion.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:21.460]   Christianity is a relationship that brings inner healing that leads transformation."
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.580]   That's actually the opposite of the direction we think.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.780]   We think we can just deal with the surface stuff and everything's going to be okay.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.980]   God is not five tips to help you control your drinking.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.980]   He's not an Instagram reel.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.940]   Come on, church.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.940]   Jesus was here today.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.940]   He would not be making those kinds of Instagram reels, okay?
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.140]   Five tips to deal and control your drinking habit.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.700]   Instead, here's God.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:51.620]   God is like, "I want to get to the very place of the shame, the hurt, and the guilt, and
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:56.740]   the insecurity that is causing you to drink excessively in the first place.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.500]   That's what I want to walk with.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.340]   That's where my heart is for you.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:06.340]   I want to so radically transform the hardness and the darkness and the struggles and the
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:11.060]   pains and the hurts of your heart that you literally become a new person from the inside
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.060]   out."
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.060]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.900]   Wow, I'm hot.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.740]   It's really beautiful.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.740]   Notice what he says next.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.980]   I mean, he's only just getting started.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.980]   He then says this.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:31.340]   He says, "Now, you need to understand that you, being rooted and established in love,"
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.700]   may go on to have the blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.980]   But he starts, "You're rooted and established in love."
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.540]   This is really important for Paul.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.060]   He wants you to understand that the Spirit is going to come and do this incredible work
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.140]   within you.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.860]   Only the Spirit could do that out of His glorious riches.
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.500]   But He needs you to know where your starting point is.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.660]   You're rooted and established in love already.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.740]   In fact, from the very moment that you gave your life to Jesus, you find yourself rooted
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.740]   in this.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.460]   This is a metaphor he's using.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.580]   One is a agricultural metaphor.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.980]   It's for the rural people out there.
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.580]   The other one is an architectural metaphor for the urban people out there.
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.300]   He uses both to help to connect to his wide audience.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.180]   And he's saying both of those things mean the same thing.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:13.420]   You have a firm foundation in Jesus' love.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.620]   That's your starting point.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.500]   Love is our starting point.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.400]   It's not the thing that we attain and gain years down the line when we've done some behavioral
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.620]   modification that earns that love.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.220]   He's saying, "You need to understand that you are, at the very beginning, rooted and
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.720]   established in love."
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.720]   It's your firm foundation.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.140]   It's the thing that you can put your whole hope in.
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.160]   Your feet are embedded in the love of Christ.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.980]   And from there, all good things can grow.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:48.580]   All good things can be built up, to use the two metaphors, if you're rooted and established
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.580]   in love.
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:54.820]   That's important for some of you in here, because my sense is that for some of us, we
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.820]   really struggle with this.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.900]   I felt just before this service in particular that there's quite a few of us where it's
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:07.020]   been a long time since we felt loved.
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.060]   Maybe that's the reality on a human level for you.
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:14.660]   It's been a long time since you felt loved and accepted on a human level.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:18.540]   My guess is for some of us in this room, it's a divine level.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.760]   And maybe because of some of those surface things that are going on in your life, things
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:29.180]   that are important, but because of those surface things, you feel like God can't love you.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.200]   You feel unworthy to be loved.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.100]   You feel like He is distant from you.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.620]   And Paul is writing to a church where he knows all the brokenness in his church too.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:42.260]   And he's seen all the surface stuff, and he's like, "My prayer is not there.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.400]   My prayer is in their hearts.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.780]   And my prayer is that they would understand from the very beginning they are rooted and
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.020]   they are established in love."
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.740]   And as your pastor here, that is ultimately my prayer for you today.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:30:00.060]   For those of you who feel like you are not loved, I need to say that that is a lie of
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.060]   the enemy.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.900]   The enemy's greatest strategy against Christians to keep them away from the intimacy of God
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:11.620]   is to convince them that they cannot be loved.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:16.500]   Paul says you're rooted and you're established in love.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:22.220]   If you have a faith in Jesus here, you are fully, completely, totally, and absolutely
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.200]   rooted and established in love.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.440]   You can take that to the bank.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.420]   That's who you are.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:34.900]   And from that place can flourish so much growth, which is why he uses a metaphor of the rooting
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.300]   and the establishing, the agricultural and architectural, because what he's trying to
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.900]   say is, "Hey, seeds get planted in soil, not so that they remain seeds, so that they grow
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.620]   and become something.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.220]   We pour cement in the ground, not so that we can just have cement in the ground, so
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.940]   that we can build a building on top of it."
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.460]   So he's talking about growth here, which is where he now takes the prayer.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:57.140]   Now that he's established for them that they're rooted and established in love, look what
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.140]   he says here.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.540]   This is so beautiful.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:03.620]   He says that you would have the power together with all the saints to grasp how wide and
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:10.260]   long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge,
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.140]   that you may be filled to the whole measure of the fullness of God.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:19.200]   Oh man, preachers have tripped themselves up all over the place to try to define what
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.460]   Paul means by high, wide, long, and deep is the love of Christ.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:29.420]   There have been countless numbers of sermons to help to articulate and exegete what Paul
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:34.460]   must have been thinking, as if high love was talking about his divine love.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.920]   Wide love must have been the love that covers a multitude of sin.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.900]   Long love must be the eternal love that he has.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.900]   Deep love must be about uprooting the deepest brokenness within us.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:49.340]   And I think, sure, I'm sure all of those are biblical, all of those make sense, but I don't
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.660]   think that's what Paul's trying to communicate here.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.900]   I think actually Paul's being far more simple than that.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:05.060]   I think all Paul's doing is saying this, God's love is more vast and broad and big than you
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.500]   have ever realized.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:14.300]   His love is greater than you have ever comprehended.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:19.080]   And his love for the church, his heart, Paul's heart for the church, he wants his church
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.780]   to grasp, he uses this word grasp, it means to take hold of, take hold of in their mind
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:30.500]   to comprehend how amazing is the love of God, how big and vast and huge it truly is.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.580]   Paul's saying, whether you've been a Christian for 50 years or a Christian for five minutes,
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:39.220]   there's more of the love of Christ for you to understand, for you to grasp a hold of,
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.820]   for you to understand in your mind.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:48.260]   He wants you to grow in your comprehension of the vastness of the love of Christ.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:56.340]   And every day you wake up, you can know that love more.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.780]   Which is a great encouragement, but we have to be really careful here that we don't get
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.560]   Paul wrong.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:07.620]   What Paul's not saying is that when you became a Christian, you got a small amount of love,
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.580]   and now you just need to grasp a hold of more and more amount of love.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.180]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:19.380]   What he is saying is when you became a Christian, the wholeness, you are rooted and established
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:25.620]   in the wholeness of his love, and yet I want you to continue to mature and grow in your
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:31.900]   comprehension, your understanding of that love that is already fully yours.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:37.580]   Let me help explain that by sharing a story out of Chris and I's life.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:41.220]   So Chris and I couldn't have our own children, went into the adoption process.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.140]   After a long period, we finally got a phone call.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:48.820]   We've matched you to this amazing kid, half Nepalese, half Indonesian, 16 months old.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.540]   We're not going to show you a photo.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.940]   We can't tell you much about it, but you need to say yes or no.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.180]   So we said yes.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.680]   Now just the day before we met our daughter for the very first time, we met with our social
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.680]   workers.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.940]   And our social workers, who had been brilliant throughout the whole process, our social workers
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.940]   said this.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.820]   They said, "Now we need to prepare you for tomorrow.
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:15.180]   We need to prepare you because the chances are you will not love this kid straight away.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:19.300]   You need to be prepared that you will not love them because this is not like a biological
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.300]   thing.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.380]   This is not like you've had nine months with this child and the child comes and all this
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:28.200]   pain and kind of celebration of childbirth and there's this immediate emotional connection
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.540]   between you and the child."
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.900]   They're like, "No, no.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.160]   Adoption is kind of a bit more sort of, you know, not particularly emotional.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:40.020]   And so you need to be prepared when you meet this person tomorrow for the first time, chances
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:44.020]   are you will not love them."
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:49.060]   Chris and I left that meeting and our first thought was, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.060]   Because we were like, "Nuh-uh.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.380]   That's not going to be our story."
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:56.820]   Now we appreciate what the social workers were trying to say, but we were like, "Nah,
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.820]   nah, nah, nah.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.620]   We believe in a God who can do all things.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.320]   A God who can strengthen us with power in our inner being.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:08.080]   We're going to come tomorrow and I tell you what, I'm praying that the Lord will so fill
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:14.840]   me with a love for this child that it will be like literally this child came from Chris."
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.140]   So we show up the next day, sitting in this room, there's a glass door in front of us.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.940]   The child comes down with the social worker.
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.260]   We can't see it properly yet, but there's a silhouette of this 16-month-old girl wearing
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.460]   a tutu.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:33.700]   And as we're looking at the silhouette, we're already loving this child.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:40.100]   And then the door opens and Mia walks into our lives and immediately, 100%, I have never
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.740]   loved anything in this, other than my wife.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.460]   I had to say this this morning.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:51.220]   I have never loved anything inside of me and Chris had never loved anything inside of her
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:56.600]   more completely and fully than that child in that moment.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.420]   It was an instant full, all of our love to Mia.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.060]   Are you with me?
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.780]   But here's the interesting thing.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:09.980]   Mia had to grow in her comprehension of that love.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.020]   It was all there from day one.
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:16.060]   In fact, my very first thought after I saw Mia for the first time, it's funny how the
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:23.220]   mind works, my very first thought was, "I can't wait to walk her down the aisle.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.940]   I'm a father now.
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.600]   And one day I'm going to walk her down the aisle."
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.460]   And I literally, that was my first thought.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:35.600]   We loved her fully, but she had to grow in her comprehension of that love.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:40.280]   For example, we would carry her for weeks afterwards and her limbs would just dangle
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.240]   beside us because she didn't know what intimacy was like.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.600]   We would walk and hold her hand and her hand would just be like this.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.380]   My hand would be clasped around hers.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.840]   She wouldn't clasp because she didn't understand love and intimacy.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:58.360]   After about three months of her not really showing that much love to Chris and I or any
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.320]   intimacy, Chris and I are standing in the kitchen one day in our apartment and we're
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.880]   talking about the fact, "Well, maybe Mia's never going to be an affectionate child and
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.200]   we're just going to have to get used to that and that's just going to be something that
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.120]   God's going to have to give us a strength for."
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.040]   Mia walks in and she's about knee height to us at this time.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.800]   She walks over to Chris, she leans forward and goes and kisses her on the knee.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:23.400]   It's the first expression of intimacy she's ever done and Chris is like, "Ahh!"
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:34.760]   And I'm standing there like, "What about my knees?"
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:40.280]   And she walks over to me and pecks me lightly on my knee and she walks out of the room.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.120]   Chris and I are like, "Done."
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:50.440]   But Mia had to comprehend, learn, be exposed to, understand love in order to respond to
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.440]   love.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.000]   John would write this in one of his letters, wouldn't he?
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.920]   "You are able to love because he first loved you."
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.080]   And so here is Paul writing to the church and he's saying, "You are rooted and established
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.080]   in love.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.920]   You have the fullness of that love but my heart is that you would comprehend that love
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:10.200]   more and more and more and as you comprehend it, you will respond to it in such a profound
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   and beautiful way.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.400]   You've walked through that door and your father is standing there and he sees you and
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:20.440]   he loves you fully if you've given your life to Jesus but oh, we can grow, can't we, in
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:27.800]   our comprehension of that love of God that is so high, so wide, so long, so deep that
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:32.320]   it can literally transform the brokenness within us."
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.160]   Which is why he then finishes with this.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:39.800]   He says, "And that you would know this love that surpasses knowledge."
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.440]   He's just said, "I want you to have a better comprehension of this love in your mind."
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.200]   But then he goes, "But that's just not enough.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.440]   I don't want you just to grow daily in your comprehension of the love.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.640]   I want you to know it."
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.520]   He's drawing from the Old Testament once again.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:57.280]   This idea of intimacy, to know someone was an Old Testament biblical way to speak about
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.080]   intimacy and relationship.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.800]   He's saying, "I want you to know this love that surpasses knowledge.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.480]   Yes, you can grow in your comprehension of it but that's not enough either.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.280]   I want you to actually physically experience it and feel it and know it and grow in it
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:17.000]   so that when you both in your mind can understand it and in your spirit receive it, you will
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.720]   be transformed to the fullness of the wholeness of Christ."
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:29.280]   All of which is a summary of this prayer here.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.820]   You are rooted and established in love.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.680]   You can grasp and comprehend its wonder more and more.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.840]   And you can experience it beyond just the mere idea of it.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.800]   You can know it intimately and personally right here and now.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.920]   This love comes by the Spirit to strengthen you with power in the places where you are
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:52.520]   most broken so you will become a living example of what the fullness of God looks like.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.680]   That's Paul's prayer for his church.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.800]   And we as a leadership would say, "That's our prayer for you.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.160]   That's growing big people.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.840]   That's for you from us.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:12.400]   If this is your home church, that's everything why we do what we do."
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:20.160]   So that you would come to a profound relationship with a inner healing and transformative God.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.120]   So that your eyes of the heart would be open so you could see Him.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:28.060]   Your mind would comprehend His love more greater than you could ever have thought.
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.860]   And you would know that love that surpasses your understanding.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:35.120]   You would feel it and sense it and see it so that you would know the fullness of Christ
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.120]   in your life.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:45.680]   Oh Lord, that you would do that to your church.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:53.880]   May the breath of God's Spirit break back the lies of the enemy that would say you are
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.520]   not worthy to be loved.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:03.040]   And may you come to a deeper and more profound realization out of the glorious riches of
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.560]   Christ how much He really loves you.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.760]   Can we pray?
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.600]   Let's pray.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.480]   I wonder as we pray you could just quieten your heart.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:26.360]   As your eyes are closed, maybe just take a moment just to come before Him.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:32.640]   For you are rooted and established in love.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:38.800]   He loves you so, so much.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:45.960]   I want to pray for those of you in this room that are really struggling to know love.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:50.440]   Some of you, like I said, that's a human level.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.120]   You feel deeply lonely.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.280]   Perhaps on the surface your life looks amazing.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:04.360]   Perhaps you have a great job, great husband, wife, great family, great friends, spirit
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.360]   of influence.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:10.200]   Perhaps on the surface things seem to be great but nobody really knows that deep down inside
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:14.400]   of you you're desperately lonely.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.880]   But the Lord sees that.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:25.680]   And the Lord's desire is that He would strengthen you with power by His Spirit in those places.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:30.640]   The places that many people don't know about but you know.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:35.960]   Some of you are lacking that sense of human love.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.600]   Some of you in this room you're lacking a sense of divine love.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.680]   You feel like you're unworthy of being loved by Him.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:48.840]   Perhaps your sin or your brokenness or the mistakes you've made are very, very front
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.600]   and center in your mind.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:58.120]   May Paul's words set you free today that you are rooted and established in love.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.880]   You've walked through that door and the Father loves you.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:08.920]   And it's a lie of the enemy to say that you are unworthy of being loved.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.840]   And here at the Vine we come against the work of the enemy in that area over these people
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.360]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:21.120]   Out of your glorious riches Lord, you would strengthen with power by your Spirit in their
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:29.240]   inner being, the people in this room, to know your love.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.960]   So I wonder whether you would want to respond to that.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:35.440]   You can just open your hands where you are and I'm going to pray.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:40.600]   I'm just going to invite the Holy Spirit now.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:49.160]   Just whilst we are in this place of receiving, this is the most important part of the service.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:55.680]   For here on Pentecost Sunday, that promise of Ezekiel 36 is real and true and fulfilled
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.000]   in Christ.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:05.160]   And that any hardness of heart, any hurt and pain, whatever might be the deepest thing
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:13.040]   inside of us, Christ can heal and restore and strengthen.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.320]   So come Holy Spirit.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:26.720]   Come Holy Spirit.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:33.160]   Come Holy Spirit.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:38.320]   Take some time to receive him.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:42.360]   You are loved.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.440]   You are loved.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:55.760]   It's not your fault for how you're feeling unloved.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:06.560]   You are loved.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:11.440]   Come Holy Spirit.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.800]   Strengthen your church.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.000]   Pour out your presence.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:28.200]   What we're going to do in a moment is we're just going to have the prayer team come forward
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:33.240]   and they're going to be here at the front.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:37.280]   I want to encourage you, this has been important to you today.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.840]   Have some people come around you today and just love on you.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:46.720]   Love on you by praying for you, by speaking truth and life to you.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:53.480]   For some of you in this room, that's really important for you today, is to receive ministry
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:58.000]   by the Spirit of God through somebody else praying for you and speaking life into you.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.120]   So our prayer team are going to be here now.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.360]   So if you're on the prayer team, I want to invite you just to be in the front now.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:10.800]   And in a moment, if you would like to receive prayer, I'm going to invite you to come and
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.680]   receive prayer.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:17.840]   Some of you may just want to sit, and you may just want to sit for another five, ten
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:22.440]   minutes or so and just allow the Holy Spirit to minister to you, just to speak to you.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.280]   Maybe it's just personal for you.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:29.160]   Or maybe you've come with someone and you can pray together and you just want to soak
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:33.760]   in the presence of God that is here, right here and now.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.640]   You're more than welcome to stay and receive from Him.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.160]   For those of you that need to leave in a moment, you're welcome to do that, but I ask you to
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:48.280]   do it respectfully and quietly as we respect the people in this room who are receiving
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.400]   from the Holy Spirit.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:55.000]   But you're more than welcome to make an exit when you feel you're led to.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.080]   Let me pray for us.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:03.160]   Father, in the gentleness of your presence that's been here from the start of this service,
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.480]   would you now continue to minister to our hearts.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:10.920]   Lord, I pray that every person that needs prayer in this room will receive prayer.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.560]   Any person that just needs to sit in your presence would just receive from you in that
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.560]   way.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:21.920]   For those of us that need to go, we bless them to go with the love of Christ, to serve
