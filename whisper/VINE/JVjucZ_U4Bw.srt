1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,900
 You guys go ahead and have a seat.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,060
 (audience applauding)

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,400
 Well, good morning.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,320
 I feel like it needs to be said.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,080
 I am Pastor Promise.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,640
 It's a very odd thing to say Pastor Promise

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,920
 in reference to myself.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,360
 I normally go by just,

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,680
 have you guys ever thought about this?

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,600
 Like pastors are like, maybe doctors sometimes as well,

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,600
 but like you don't like go around and say,

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,760
 hi teacher, this person or hi counselor,

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,960
 this like Pastor Promise or I don't know.

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,800
 It's a weird thing.

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,760
 Anyways, I'm Pastor Promise, not preacher promise

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,440
 as Pastor Carla might get you to believe.

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,980
 And I'm super glad that I can be here

19
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,320
 with you guys this morning.

20
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,960
 And carry us another step forward in our Exodus journey.

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,000
 Just quick show of hands, if you were here last Sunday.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,080
 Yeah, great.

23
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,280
 What did Pastor Andrew talk about?

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,640
 What was the theme?

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,960
 We were here, but were we here?

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,840
 All right, good, now we know.

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,480
 Last week was the Red Sea.

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,480
 Last week was incredible.

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,740
 It was one of the coolest miracles.

30
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,560
 One of the best sermons that I've ever heard on the Red Sea.

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,760
 The Red Sea is a fascinating concept, right?

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,340
 Like I could never wrap my head around the reality

33
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,440
 that God parted the sea.

34
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,440
 Like let's just not overlook that for a minute.

35
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,240
 The fact that a sea went, it's crazy.

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,540
 But Pastor Andrew took us to that very place

37
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,780
 in the Exodus journey.

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,960
 And he showed us how we have to have the ability

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,120
 and the desire and maybe the step of faith

40
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,040
 to choose to follow God, even before he parts the seas,

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,080
 but he still parted the seas.

42
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,340
 Now I think really interestingly,

43
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,840
 I have a weird way of processing things.

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,480
 So as that sermon was going through,

45
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,960
 I was thinking about this movie, this show.

46
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,280
 I think it's a movie.

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,680
 Has anyone here seen "The Prince of Egypt"?

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,400
 Hey, all right, cool, we all know the song.

49
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,560
 ♪ There can be miracles ♪

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
 - Ah, just hits the soul, right?

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
 Rest in peace, Whitney Houston.

52
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,680
 Anyways, so in that movie, if you've not seen it before,

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,640
 it's DreamWorks' rendition of the Exodus story.

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
 And it takes you through all the plagues

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,200
 and Moses growing up in Egypt,

56
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,520
 and they take them to the Red Sea.

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,460
 And even though it's animated,

58
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,920
 it's still like massive and awesome and cool.

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,600
 And it gets me thinking around the idea

60
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,240
 of what would it have been like for the people of Israel

61
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,400
 when the sea literally split?

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,880
 Like, let's just zoom in on that for a second.

63
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,080
 What would that have been like to watch the sea go crazy?

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,640
 And then to like walk across it.

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,320
 That's like a crazy miracle, right?

66
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,400
 Like I often wonder, like,

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,160
 were they walking on the dry land?

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,000
 And then like, you know,

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,080
 there's like a giant whale that comes by,

70
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,940
 but because there's a wall of water, right?

71
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,720
 Like, you know, you see the, like in the movie,

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,120
 you see the reflection of the whale,

73
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,480
 but it doesn't actually reach you.

74
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,560
 Or if you were a fish and it was Red Sea crossing day,

75
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,920
 and you wake up that morning

76
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,400
 and you're going to your buddy Bob's house

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
 or Nemo's house, more appropriate,

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
 and you're trying to swim over.

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,600
 And all of a sudden you get to this part

80
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,080
 and you're like, "Whoa, humans.

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,040
 "What am I seeing?

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,880
 "A bunch of dudes walking and ladies walking

83
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,800
 "and carrying things."

84
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,920
 I'm curious if they would have been like,

85
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,080
 what is happening?

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
 Regardless, I think just, I know it's silly,

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,740
 but like the Red Sea splitting is a crazy concept.

88
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,360
 It's like a miracle.

89
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,040
 It's like the miracle of miracles.

90
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,740
 If you were to list out like the best miracles,

91
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,300
 like a top three, the Red Sea's up there.

92
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,580
 Like if I could go back and see any miracle

93
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,940
 that would have happened in the past,

94
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,300
 I feel like that's the one,

95
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,300
 I would have been like, "Sign me up,

96
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,840
 "get me a ticket, front row seats.

97
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,220
 "I wanna see what really happened."

98
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,140
 It's a really cool thing,

99
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,820
 but I think what we have to take away from the Red Sea

100
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,740
 and these miracle concepts is that it shows us

101
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,680
 something that's really, really clear.

102
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,600
 God has no limit in his capability

103
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,560
 to provide for his people.

104
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,420
 Like if he's gonna part a sea, what will he not do?

105
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,300
 Like he's just so willing, so capable.

106
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,500
 He has so much of an ability to provide for his people

107
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,140
 that he parted the sea for them.

108
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,620
 It's really the miracle of miracles.

109
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,940
 And I bring that up because the entire story of Exodus

110
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,100
 has been quite filled with miracles,

111
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,840
 whether it's the sea turning, the Nile turning to blood,

112
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,300
 or the sun going dark for a day,

113
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,380
 or the livestock, or the frogs, or the flies,

114
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,420
 or the gnats, or the boils, or the, you just name it.

115
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,460
 It's just miracle after miracle,

116
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,760
 after miracle, after miracle.

117
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,260
 It's a bunch of miracles happening.

118
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,780
 And it makes me wonder,

119
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,560
 what exactly are all these miracles about?

120
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,960
 What do miracles actually do?

121
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,420
 And so I wrote a pretty little definition here.

122
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,820
 It says this, miracles are the inbreaking of the divine,

123
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,260
 working and providing what we could not

124
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,220
 naturally achieve ourselves.

125
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,300
 So just sit on that for a minute.

126
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,580
 Miracles are the inbreaking of the divine.

127
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,780
 So something that is done by God,

128
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,780
 and it's only working, or a key word here,

129
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,220
 providing what we could not naturally

130
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,340
 achieve or do on our own.

131
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,280
 So many miracles are based around

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,260
 the idea of God's provision, right?

133
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,380
 Like the Red Sea, the people were,

134
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,420
 hey, been freed from Egypt, they're on their way,

135
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,820
 and then they had this giant obstacle,

136
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,780
 and they need someone to provide them a way over,

137
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,660
 or provide some direction,

138
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,580
 and God shows up and parts the Red Sea.

139
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,420
 It's about his provision.

140
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,500
 He literally provided a way

141
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
 when there was an impossible situation

142
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,700
 in front of his people.

143
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,940
 He's never unable to provide.

144
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,500
 I feel like that's what we get from that.

145
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,820
 No matter what happens, God will provide for his people.

146
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,160
 It's who he is, it's what he does,

147
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,560
 it's part of his name, it's just who God is.

148
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,580
 But the thing is this,

149
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,320
 miracles are just one of the ways that he provides.

150
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,660
 It might be the most recognizable.

151
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
 Like when we think of a miracle,

152
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,580
 we think of the supernatural, we think of the big thing,

153
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,560
 it might be the most recognizable way,

154
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,780
 but it's only one way that God

155
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,440
 actually provides for his people.

156
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,560
 God provides all the time for his people.

157
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,280
 And so if miracles are just one way,

158
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,900
 that must mean that there are other ways

159
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,220
 in which God provides.

160
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,120
 And I think it's very important that we today

161
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,760
 wrap our heads around what are some of the other ways

162
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,320
 that God provides for his people

163
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,320
 beyond just the obvious supernatural miracle.

164
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,220
 Is there another way that God chooses

165
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,440
 to emphatically declare to the world

166
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,700
 that I am God, that I provide for my people,

167
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,400
 and to declare to us that I provide for you.

168
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,480
 Are there other ways in which that happens?

169
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,160
 And if there are, we've got to be able to recognize it.

170
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,000
 So that's the key.

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,800
 If there are other ways in which God

172
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
 does provide for you and for me in our journey,

173
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,800
 then we've got to be able to recognize it.

174
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
 But if we don't realize that it's there,

175
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,320
 we might miss it, only worshiping the God

176
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,580
 of the supernatural.

177
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,800
 So as we continue our Exodus story today,

178
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,280
 that's what we're gonna focus on.

179
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,840
 We're gonna be looking at the challenges

180
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,920
 that the people faced when they departed from the Red Sea

181
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,520
 and in that journey.

182
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,920
 And it's important that we really pay attention

183
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,040
 and grab hold of these truths,

184
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,960
 because similar to how God shows us

185
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,260
 that there's multiple ways that he provided

186
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,420
 for the people of Israel, beyond just the miracle,

187
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,700
 God also has multiple ways in which he's gonna provide

188
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,420
 for you and me as we too go through our Exodus,

189
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,680
 as we walk away from slavery, are set free,

190
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,400
 and walk into his promise, into his freedom.

191
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,920
 He has multiple ways of providing,

192
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,960
 and we've got to be able to recognize that as well.

193
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,440
 So when we look at Exodus chapter 15 through chapter 17,

194
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,000
 we are given a series of stories.

195
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,460
 We're only gonna focus on two of them.

196
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,120
 Two stories, two moments, two locations

197
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,360
 in which God provides in a way that is different

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,000
 from the big miracle.

199
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,240
 So for a way to frame these two accounts,

200
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,740
 and in order to best provide you a great introduction

201
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,480
 into what these stories are all about,

202
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,280
 let's take a look at the film today.

203
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:50,600
 - Israel have just witnessed

204
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,800
 one of the most incredible miracles recorded

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,560
 for us in scripture, with the parting of the Red Sea,

206
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,280
 and the subsequent removal of the threat against them

207
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,180
 by Egypt's army.

208
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,280
 But as is so often the case in our journey to freedom,

209
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,220
 dramatic moments of God's power are often followed

210
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,800
 by the seemingly difficult normality of daily life.

211
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,400
 Israel have a long journey ahead,

212
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,140
 and their days are now consumed

213
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,180
 with the tough and tedious work

214
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,240
 of walking through the desert of Shur,

215
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,160
 one of the most hostile lands on earth.

216
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,900
 They find themselves stretched daily

217
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,120
 to their physical and emotional limits,

218
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,200
 and their water and their food supplies quickly run out.

219
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,800
 This is not the sort of place you would wanna be

220
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,620
 without food and water.

221
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,600
 Across this series, I've spent hours

222
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,400
 walking through deserts like this

223
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,760
 to get a sense of what it would have been like for Israel

224
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,160
 in those first few weeks

225
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,240
 as they journeyed towards the promised land.

226
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,300
 And I can tell you, it is unbearably hot.

227
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,960
 It is sort of stark and barren.

228
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,560
 There's a wind blowing right now

229
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,880
 that's putting sand in my eyes all the time.

230
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,760
 You might be able to hear

231
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,920
 some of the wild dogs in this area.

232
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,480
 I mean, this is not the place

233
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,560
 you wanna spend a lot of time in.

234
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,600
 I mean, for me, I can escape easy.

235
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,580
 I can go over there to the van that's air conditioned

236
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,860
 and get out of the heat.

237
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,300
 But the Israelites, this was their life,

238
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,460
 week in and week out.

239
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,560
 They were carrying all of their possessions

240
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,620
 on their shoulders.

241
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,140
 They were walking daily, young and old alike.

242
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,740
 I mean, every day would have felt like a moment

243
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,180
 of a fight for survival.

244
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,420
 You know, the parting of the Red Sea

245
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,820
 in this kind of environment

246
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,820
 would have felt a long time ago indeed.

247
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,040
 (dramatic music)

248
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,880
 (water splashing)

249
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,880
 the Red Sea. (dramatic music)

250
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,720
 (water splashing)

251
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,980
 (dramatic music)

252
00:09:49,980 --> 00:10:07,780
 But God is about to change Israel's thinking

253
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,240
 when it comes to their understanding

254
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,400
 of His care and provision for them.

255
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,420
 And it all starts with something as simple as this,

256
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,560
 a well dug here at Elam,

257
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,460
 right in the heart of the desert itself.

258
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,460
 You see, Exodus chapter 15 gives us the story

259
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,980
 of Israel being desperately in need of water.

260
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,540
 And they suddenly come across this oasis,

261
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,660
 some 12 wells and 70 palm trees.

262
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,940
 And to be honest, being here,

263
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,060
 I can really sense how overjoyed Israel would have been

264
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,540
 to finally find the relief of this natural water source.

265
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,760
 I mean, it's a natural spring at the right time

266
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
 and in the right place.

267
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,320
 All of which teaches us something quite critical

268
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,840
 about God's provision in all of our journeys

269
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,440
 from slavery to freedom.

270
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,480
 You see, the greatest miracles of God

271
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,680
 are often found in the most natural of circumstances.

272
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,640
 Yes, He is the God who parts the Red Seas,

273
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,720
 but He's also the God who comes

274
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,800
 and holds all of the world's natural processes in His hands.

275
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,180
 I mean, the rain that falls and collects in pools like this,

276
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,460
 the air that we breathe every day,

277
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,900
 all of them are provisions of God's blessings.

278
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,540
 You see, the provision of God

279
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,460
 is quite literally everywhere.

280
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,540
 And the question that God was asking Israel

281
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,060
 in this moment was this, do you actually see it?

282
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,120
 Sometimes the provisions of God are far closer to us

283
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,200
 than we ever would have expected.

284
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,440
 Soon after, Israel has been provided the water

285
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,160
 at the wells of Elam.

286
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,140
 They then come here and are attacked by the Amalekites

287
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,660
 right in the Valley of Rephidim.

288
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,920
 Now, Moses scrambles up to the side of the hill here

289
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,800
 and he looks down on the valley.

290
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,080
 And the Bible tells us that

291
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,520
 if he holds the staff of God in the air,

292
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,760
 well then the Israelites are having victory.

293
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,420
 But if his arms drop, the Amalekites have the victory.

294
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,780
 Well, for Moses, you can imagine the pressure

295
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,860
 this put him under.

296
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,740
 I mean, I've just tried to do this myself.

297
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,460
 If I hold my arms in the air,

298
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,420
 I can probably do it for about three minutes

299
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,940
 before they start to ache and they get a bit heavy.

300
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,900
 Well, the same thing happens for Moses,

301
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,460
 his arms get tired.

302
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,820
 And so he calls on two of his friends, Aaron and Hur,

303
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,260
 who come alongside of him, hold his arms up

304
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,540
 and keep his arms high until sunset.

305
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,660
 And a victory comes for the Israelites.

306
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,440
 Now, you've probably heard that story before,

307
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,980
 but I wonder whether you've ever stopped

308
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,560
 to understand how really strange it is.

309
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,280
 I mean, think of it this way.

310
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,360
 The Bible tells us that actually the Israelites

311
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,560
 were highly outnumbered by the Amalekites.

312
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,320
 This was not a fair fight.

313
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,440
 And God gives them a miracle in their victory.

314
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,480
 And I've always wondered,

315
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,220
 why didn't God extend that miracle

316
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,920
 just a little bit more to Moses' arms?

317
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,420
 Why didn't he give him a supernatural ability

318
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,160
 to hold his arms in the air?

319
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
 Well, God doesn't.

320
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,120
 And instead, he has to call on his friends

321
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,860
 to help him achieve the very thing

322
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,960
 that God had called him to do.

323
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,760
 Without Aaron and Hur by his side,

324
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,600
 perhaps the victory would never have occurred.

325
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
 And I think all of this tells us something

326
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,360
 really interesting about God's provision

327
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,240
 in any of our journeys in Exodus,

328
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,560
 that so often His greatest power is seen

329
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,600
 when actually He brings the community around us.

330
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,140
 It's when we're working together as a team

331
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,540
 that we can achieve things far greater

332
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,120
 than we ever would have been able to on our own.

333
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,640
 In these early moments of the Exodus,

334
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,280
 we see God's people learning to put their trust

335
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,660
 in God's provision,

336
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,160
 even at times when they don't appreciate it.

337
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,720
 Whether that provision comes to them

338
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,140
 through supernatural, miraculous ways,

339
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,020
 or through the natural processes of the creative world,

340
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,380
 or even in the community that God's placed around them.

341
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,100
 And I wanna say this to you about your own Exodus journey.

342
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,780
 I want you to know that God is at work

343
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,260
 always providing for your freedom.

344
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,660
 And my prayer is that He would open your eyes today

345
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,820
 so you can see it.

346
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:22,300
 - And so the Elam story takes place

347
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,100
 off the back of one of the greatest miracles

348
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,220
 we've talked about.

349
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,020
 Let me set the scene for us a little bit.

350
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,500
 The people have experienced the sea parting

351
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,420
 and they're going to be walking through the desert.

352
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,620
 You get the first, I think in Exodus 15,

353
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,900
 you have the first ever worship song that's recorded.

354
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,580
 'Cause they've just seen God at work

355
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,100
 in such a crazy way providing for them.

356
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,660
 They sing a song praising God for rescuing them,

357
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,540
 freeing them, destroying the Egyptians,

358
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,440
 and just liberating them into freedom.

359
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,260
 And just not shortly after that,

360
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,860
 they're taken off of that mountaintop place.

361
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,980
 And they're brought into a reality

362
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,860
 that I feel like most of us are regularly sitting in.

363
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,980
 It's the reality of the everyday life.

364
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,340
 So they're no longer at the place

365
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,140
 where it's like big miracle, whabam,

366
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,700
 God is for us, God is here.

367
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,620
 Now they're having to do the nothing fancy,

368
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,580
 the nothing big, the ordinary, the pretty simple stuff.

369
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,420
 They've been liberated and they've already had the time

370
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,780
 of being able to focus on the hyper,

371
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,260
 hyper spiritual, supernatural stuff.

372
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,260
 They've seen it and now God's put them

373
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,260
 in the boring, everyday, ordinary, no fancy miracle time.

374
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,260
 And their job is this, they are migrating out of Egypt.

375
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,680
 So if you're migrating, they've got maybe some backpacks,

376
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,780
 some donkeys, some horses, some carts,

377
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,380
 they've got all their stuff,

378
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,420
 and they're going to go into the desert.

379
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,100
 So they're carrying things, walking,

380
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,120
 they're tired, they're hungry, they're annoyed,

381
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,680
 they're with people so they're definitely annoyed,

382
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,740
 they're frustrated, they're sweaty.

383
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,720
 It's daily life, it's what we normally go through

384
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,020
 pretty much every single day of our life, right?

385
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,860
 Just the normal stuff.

386
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,160
 It's not a stage that's set for the supernatural

387
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,900
 breaking in for liberation, it's the stage that's set

388
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,480
 for meeting the basic necessities of humanity,

389
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,140
 of substance, of bread and of water, just the basic stuff.

390
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,340
 The text tells us that they've traveled

391
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,020
 for about three days now, which doesn't seem

392
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,180
 like a very long time.

393
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,060
 And in those three days, their water supply

394
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,900
 is starting to run low.

395
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,280
 This is important because you're in a desert,

396
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,380
 it's hot and you need to drink.

397
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,100
 So the people are starting to freak out a little bit

398
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,340
 and they get to this area and the place,

399
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,220
 they don't have a name for it, but they get there

400
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,120
 and they're thinking, okay, maybe we can rest here

401
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,820
 and get refreshed and replenished,

402
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,100
 but the water that they find is bitter.

403
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,900
 So then they can't stay there, no one's gonna stay

404
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,360
 and build and replenish their animals

405
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,520
 and take care of themselves with bitter water.

406
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,620
 So they actually name the place, the Hebrew word

407
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,540
 for bitter, which is more mora.

408
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,020
 So they leave that area and they keep going

409
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,420
 and they're getting tired, they're wondering,

410
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,560
 you know, what's next, where do we find our place of rest?

411
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,380
 We just wanna chill out, we just wanna break.

412
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,340
 We've been walking in the desert for a few days.

413
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,060
 And I think it's right there in verse 27

414
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,700
 that God breaks through in a pretty unpredictable,

415
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,660
 unnoticeable way, something that I feel like

416
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,620
 for most of us, we would kind of just read over

417
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,780
 and not really see, it says this in verse 27.

418
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,380
 And they came to Elam, where there were 12 springs of water

419
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,180
 and 70 palm trees, and they encamped there

420
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,060
 beside the waters.

421
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,300
 For the record, Elam sounds like a great place.

422
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,100
 70 palm trees, it sounds like a good time.

423
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,740
 So they see that and they're like, all right,

424
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,620
 here's a place.

425
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,740
 I read that verse because there's nothing really special

426
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,060
 about what's just happened.

427
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,320
 They were just walking, there was no staff,

428
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,240
 there was no tornado of fire, they're just going,

429
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,240
 they're just doing their everyday migrating stuff

430
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,580
 and they come across the right thing at the right time.

431
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,080
 They find the right place.

432
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,360
 No seas are being parted, but now they have a place

433
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,960
 where they can relax, where they can rest for a little bit

434
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,840
 before they continue their journey.

435
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,960
 And it's a point where I feel like it's a bit awkward

436
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,480
 because it's not a clear picture of God's provision, right?

437
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,360
 Like it doesn't say, and then God provided wells

438
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,100
 or God provided 70 palm trees to just grow overnight.

439
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,720
 Like they just showed up and there's wells

440
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
 and water to drink.

441
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,560
 Is that a clear picture of God's provision?

442
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,600
 But I feel like it's pretty intentional.

443
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,880
 Think about where this falls.

444
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,980
 Right after they've had like maybe the clearest picture

445
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,640
 of God's provision, Spartan Red Sea,

446
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,720
 the whole Nemo thing that I talked about, right?

447
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,520
 You have that clear picture and now you have this

448
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,360
 where I just found some wells and some palm trees.

449
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,920
 What do I do with that?

450
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,520
 I feel like it occurs intentionally in scripture

451
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,860
 right at that time on purpose for us to understand

452
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,140
 and see that God is working.

453
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,840
 God is providing, he's leading and he's guiding

454
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,100
 even in the moments that are not so obvious.

455
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,760
 That placing of that.

456
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,280
 Now I wonder if we would consider our Exodus journey

457
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,400
 and where we're going with everything.

458
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,720
 I feel like for us a lot of days are anticlimactic, right?

459
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,520
 Not too much is happening all the time.

460
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,840
 It's pretty basic, pretty mundane, pretty ordinary,

461
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,260
 just living life, waking up, getting on the train,

462
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,200
 going to work, being annoyed at my friends,

463
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,360
 drinking four coffees.

464
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,120
 It's just part of the regular average day.

465
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,800
 And it can be a bit challenging for us to see God in that.

466
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,080
 Like where is God moving?

467
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,760
 There's no big miracle happening so is God even active?

468
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,440
 Is he still a part of this journey

469
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,880
 or am I just doing my everyday stuff by myself?

470
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,960
 I think that we have to realize that just because

471
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,040
 your Red Sea moment is behind you

472
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,080
 does not mean the best moments are in the past.

473
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:47,000
 God, the miracle worker who parts Red Seas is the same God

474
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,120
 who just basically leads and guides us step by step

475
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,440
 to where we need to go.

476
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,200
 He's the one that brings us to our elims,

477
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,080
 our places of rest, the things that we need.

478
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,880
 His provision on our Exodus journey is expressed this way

479
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,920
 intentionally so that we can hold on to hope

480
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,600
 that when we're not seeing him in the big things

481
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,080
 doesn't mean that he's not there.

482
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,600
 This story gives us a bit of hope that

483
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,440
 just because the seed didn't part for me today

484
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,920
 doesn't mean God is inactive in my world,

485
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,200
 doesn't mean that God doesn't care,

486
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,920
 doesn't mean that God is far away.

487
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,960
 Please don't gauge God's provision or even his presence

488
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,280
 with you on whether or not big miracles

489
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,720
 are taking place around you.

490
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,340
 He's still with you, he's still for you,

491
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,740
 he's still leading you into the very freedom

492
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,200
 that he has promised.

493
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,000
 So can we choose to trust that he doesn't always

494
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,960
 have to do the supernatural to provide for us,

495
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,080
 that the everyday and the ordinary

496
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,240
 are his provision methods too.

497
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,800
 Perhaps the ordinary days are God's workstation

498
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,920
 and though it may feel empty and dry

499
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,160
 and like we're literally in a desert,

500
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,000
 can we trust that even when we don't see it he's working?

501
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,240
 We're just saying that even when we don't feel it

502
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,320
 he's working, he's working on our behalf,

503
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,320
 he's liberating, he's still the God that provides for us

504
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,760
 even in the small moments.

505
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,920
 He's the God of the big and he's the God of the small.

506
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,040
 Can we recognize him in those small moments?

507
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,360
 That's what Elam is calling us to see

508
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,720
 in this biblical narrative.

509
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,340
 And so Elam provides that for us, right?

510
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,120
 It gives us an understanding that God is active,

511
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,460
 God is there in the small moments.

512
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,120
 The Red Sea which happened right before that

513
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,400
 gave us an understanding that God breaks into our world

514
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,640
 and provides for us in miraculous ways.

515
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,800
 We've got miraculous provision, we've got natural provision

516
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,280
 but there's actually a third way in which God chooses

517
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,820
 to provide for his people and it's based off

518
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,080
 of what happens in the second half of Exodus 17.

519
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,040
 So what happens here is the people are,

520
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,040
 they've left Elam, they've journeyed into the Desert of Sin,

521
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,120
 they've had the experience of the manna and the Sabbath

522
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,240
 and all these great things and now they're moving on

523
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,360
 forward again, right?

524
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,500
 So they're continuing to go forward.

525
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,000
 And just here in verse eight, it says it really clear.

526
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,080
 Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.

527
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,040
 This happens, it seems pretty dramatic

528
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,880
 but it does happen just as abruptly as it is written.

529
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,220
 There is indeed a nation that, an established nation

530
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,720
 that starts a battle, an unprovoked aggression

531
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,320
 against the people of Israel who had not really

532
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,600
 been established as a nation yet.

533
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,940
 You have to think about what would have their thoughts

534
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,920
 been in that moment.

535
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,160
 God has provided for us in big supernatural ways,

536
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,840
 God has provided for us in the small

537
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,000
 but now there's a people trying to end our existence.

538
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,680
 If we lose here, our journey of liberation might be over.

539
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,600
 It's this whole Exodus thing for a waste

540
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,540
 if he'd bring us to the desert truly so that we would die.

541
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,200
 I think those are the questions going through their heads.

542
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,720
 Another question that I think they might have been asking

543
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,320
 themselves is, we've been slaves for hundreds of years.

544
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,400
 How do we fight against an established people?

545
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,260
 Against an army that probably had weapons

546
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,840
 and had strategies and had different levels of hierarchy.

547
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,720
 Actually Moses is funny, he just tells Joshua,

548
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,400
 go get some people and go fight Amalek.

549
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,480
 I feel like Joshua's probably a little overwhelmed

550
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,320
 at that moment.

551
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,760
 And also how do you recognize who,

552
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,920
 like there's thousands, hundreds of thousands of them.

553
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,540
 How do you know who's the best fighter?

554
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,840
 Is it the tallest person?

555
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,460
 Is it the dude with the cutoff tank?

556
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,940
 How do you know exactly who needs to be a part

557
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,360
 of this journey of this battle?

558
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,320
 And Joshua has to go and find these people.

559
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,280
 Who's gonna be the great military mind

560
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,880
 to help them move forward?

561
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,340
 Who's going to be the one that gives them the best strategy

562
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,520
 to help them move forward?

563
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,600
 How do you fight a battle when you've never fought before

564
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,600
 and your entire people's existence is on the table?

565
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,300
 It's the definition of a crisis.

566
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,960
 And I love this, I find it interesting that God,

567
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,520
 his methods are interesting.

568
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,520
 He meets his people and matches their challenge.

569
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,100
 So what we've seen so far, at the Red Sea,

570
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,120
 giant sea, giant obstacle, right?

571
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,040
 God shows up in a giant way, right?

572
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,240
 For the 19th time, parting of the Red Sea,

573
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,640
 fish, all the things.

574
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,840
 The next victim that they face,

575
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,380
 they're in the desert and it's everyday life.

576
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,260
 It's just a regular of sustaining and finding water

577
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,580
 and finding a place to rest and finding a place

578
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,820
 to make sure that my animals are taken care of.

579
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,300
 Just the basic everyday needs.

580
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,660
 And how does God show up then?

581
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,320
 He leads them to Elam, leads them to the place

582
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,540
 of all the palm trees so they can just breathe and rest.

583
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,440
 He provides for them based off of what their situation is.

584
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,780
 He matches it.

585
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,500
 And it wouldn't be any different

586
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,460
 in this coming situation, right?

587
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,900
 Because now the people of God are being attacked

588
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,740
 by a community, by a group of people under Amalek.

589
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,660
 And God is going to provide a miracle.

590
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,340
 However, this miracle is not gonna be a miracle

591
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,340
 that is able to be sustained in isolation.

592
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,340
 This is a miracle that's gonna require the community.

593
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,700
 They're being attacked by a community

594
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,300
 and God is going to work in a way

595
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,780
 that where their community is gonna be necessary

596
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,300
 to sustain and to actually experience

597
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,800
 the provision of the miracle.

598
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,800
 God would signify the importance of what a community is,

599
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,120
 how it operates, and why it's so vital

600
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,080
 to every single one of our existence.

601
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,040
 The only way that they will move forward

602
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,600
 and that they will experience this miracle

603
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,720
 is through a functioning community.

604
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,800
 So let's read what the passage has to say here in verse 10.

605
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,960
 It reads like this.

606
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,800
 So Joshua did as Moses told him and he fought Amalek.

607
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,880
 While Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill,

608
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,080
 then whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed.

609
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,520
 Whenever he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

610
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,520
 But Moses' hands grew heavy, so they took a stone

611
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,760
 and they put it under him and he sat on it.

612
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,040
 While Aaron and Hur, one on each side, supported his hands.

613
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,560
 Thus his hands remained steady until the sun set.

614
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,160
 And Joshua overwhelmed the people of Amalek with the sword.

615
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,160
 And they have their victory.

616
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,520
 There are a few things I really need us to lean into

617
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,560
 and pull out of this passage for our understanding.

618
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,400
 The first one is this, is sometimes God chooses

619
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,360
 to require the participation

620
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,320
 that's only found within our community.

621
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,100
 Hear that again.

622
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,480
 Sometimes God is going to choose to require

623
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,440
 the participation that can only be found

624
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,160
 within the community he's put you in.

625
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,920
 This miracle is different from the other ones.

626
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,400
 Moses, unlike other miracles, is not gonna be

627
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,360
 the only person that God is going to operate through.

628
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,520
 God's gonna need all the people.

629
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,560
 He's gonna need multiple people in that community.

630
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,040
 God wants to use multiple instruments

631
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,480
 to provide for his people in this case.

632
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,360
 The reality is that there will be parts

633
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,280
 of your liberation journey that God intends

634
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,360
 on us doing together in community with his people.

635
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,240
 God uses Aaron, God uses Moses, God uses Hur,

636
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,360
 God uses Joshua to provide this miracle.

637
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,960
 This miracle shows us that God provides for his people,

638
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,200
 yes, but sometimes in such a way that their community

639
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,680
 is the only way for them to walk out

640
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,160
 that expression of provision.

641
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,040
 The community becomes essential.

642
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,240
 It becomes irreplaceable, a real part

643
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,640
 of the Exodus journey into freedom.

644
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,720
 Every role is important.

645
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,440
 It doesn't matter which role you hold.

646
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,160
 They're all important in the community.

647
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,280
 It may be easy.

648
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,040
 I read this story, I naturally put myself,

649
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,680
 'cause I'm a little self-centered sometimes,

650
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,200
 I naturally put myself as the main character, Moses.

651
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
 So I read this, I'm like, okay, cool,

652
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,280
 I need to be in community.

653
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,680
 I'll be like the Moses and I'll have the,

654
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,400
 I don't know, I'll be holding up the stick

655
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,840
 as God's told me to and I'll have Jethro and Emma

656
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,000
 and B'lanna and Ron and Carla and Andrew

657
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,760
 and they'll all be holding up my arms

658
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,060
 'cause I'm not that strong.

659
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,640
 Maybe, maybe.

660
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,280
 But there are other people in this story, right?

661
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,720
 What if God's actually not called you

662
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,320
 just to be the one who's lifting your hands

663
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,640
 but maybe he's called you to be in this moment

664
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,880
 the one who lifts the hands of the person

665
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,840
 that's next to you?

666
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:27,040
 What if the person next to you needs,

667
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,900
 hear the word, needs your support?

668
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,240
 Like I love the language of this text.

669
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,280
 It doesn't just give us vague terminology.

670
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,680
 It says that they are supporting his arms.

671
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,920
 Like it couldn't be a more clear text on community, right?

672
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,760
 What if your Exodus journey requires the support

673
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,480
 of the people next to you?

674
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,160
 Let's just, I would say take a minute and look

675
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,440
 but let's actually take a minute and look to,

676
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,760
 we're gonna do it all together, ready?

677
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,780
 Look to your left.

678
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,280
 Hey, good job, some people know their left

679
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,520
 and some people don't know that.

680
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,680
 It's all right, a little confurring.

681
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,880
 All right, now take a minute and look to your right.

682
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,480
 These, unless you're on the end,

683
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,760
 then it doesn't work but it's okay.

684
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,760
 [audience laughing]

685
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,720
 These are the people God has put around you on purpose.

686
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,920
 Right, if we believe that God is almighty, all powerful,

687
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,240
 that he sits above the world and that he orchestrates things

688
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,440
 to be a certain way, then he has designed

689
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,500
 your Exodus journey to include the people around you.

690
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,760
 You can't just come and attend, right?

691
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,920
 We can't just come and see it.

692
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,360
 We're called to come and be a part of it.

693
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,360
 You're called to play a role in your neighbor's journey

694
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,720
 to liberation.

695
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,680
 But do we recognize that?

696
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,880
 Do we know that that's actually how God plans on providing

697
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,640
 in certain parts of their journey for them.

698
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,280
 You get to be a part of that.

699
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,080
 The people to your left, the people to your right.

700
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,840
 We are surrounded by people who will lift your arms.

701
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,640
 I can name so many people here who have metaphorically

702
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,740
 held my arms up in some of my toughest moments

703
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,840
 as I waited for God to bring my provision.

704
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,700
 And that has sustained me, that has been miraculous for me.

705
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,000
 But I feel like some of us don't have the same story.

706
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,940
 Some of us haven't stepped into that aspect

707
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,960
 of community yet.

708
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,840
 I believe God is calling us to consider how we

709
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,080
 could actually do that.

710
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,240
 God sets up miracles and he does set up certain miracles

711
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,320
 in our lives to necessitate the need for community.

712
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,920
 So whether it's in a community group,

713
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,400
 whether it's on the worship team or the production team,

714
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,040
 whether you're a host, whether you're downstairs

715
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,160
 on the first floor, whether you're with K4C,

716
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,080
 whether you're on any, whether you're a mom

717
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,420
 and there's a moms group that talks about mom things.

718
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,960
 These are communities that we have here at The Vine.

719
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,360
 Whether it's Chinese community, Mandarin community,

720
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,200
 whether it's 180, there are so many places for you guys

721
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,280
 to step into and find people who will lift your arms

722
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,720
 as God takes you forward in your journey.

723
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,040
 There are endless ways for you to be connected.

724
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,340
 And not just be connected for the sake of being connected,

725
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,720
 but being connected so that you can have the provision

726
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,120
 that God has orchestrated for you.

727
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,060
 God often works this way.

728
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:16,920
 The question is would we be willing to,

729
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,480
 would we recognize and actually take a step

730
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,620
 in being a part of a community so that we can experience

731
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,800
 what it is that God has.

732
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,160
 And if God often works in community through his people,

733
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,720
 then you will find that your own liberation,

734
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,800
 that much of the freedom that God has designed for you

735
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,080
 will come through the community that he's placed you in.

736
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,200
 I'll say that again.

737
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,720
 If this is how God works through community,

738
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,580
 then you will find that your own liberation journey,

739
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,640
 the freedom that he is leading you into,

740
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,600
 that journey will be designed for you to have a community

741
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,040
 where his provision comes through.

742
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,400
 It will be that community where you experience

743
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,400
 the fullness of God's actual provision for you.

744
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,960
 So let me just simplify all of these two stories

745
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,840
 into a couple of takeaways for us.

746
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,920
 And a couple of things that we need to hold onto

747
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,960
 to really get this.

748
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,480
 These two stories are just basic snapshots

749
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,440
 of how God provides.

750
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,880
 Again, the whole thesis of this is that God provides

751
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,540
 in multiple ways.

752
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,960
 So as we journey into the freedom that God has for us,

753
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,440
 the thing that we have to sit on,

754
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,880
 the thing that we have to build around is that God provides.

755
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,320
 God provides for his people, right?

756
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,760
 That is what he does, that is who he is.

757
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
 But he provides in multiple ways.

758
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,400
 And if we don't recognize the multiple ways

759
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,840
 that God provides in, we find ourselves being on the out.

760
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,760
 We find ourselves missing what he's actually doing for us.

761
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,860
 If we don't recognize the ways that God provides,

762
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,740
 we are at risk.

763
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,800
 We are at risk of falling back into our slavery,

764
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,080
 feeling that God can't be found 'cause he's abandoned us,

765
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,500
 or that he's lost, or that he's forgotten about us.

766
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,240
 The enemy would love nothing more, please hear this,

767
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,680
 would love nothing more than for you to think

768
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,120
 that your ordinary days mean that God no longer cares,

769
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,720
 that God's no longer interested,

770
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,760
 God's done working with you.

771
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,640
 And that's a powerful lie because you're going to have

772
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,760
 so many more ordinary days than miraculous days.

773
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,880
 So we've got to understand, we've got to recognize

774
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,720
 that God is still God working in the small,

775
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,740
 working in the little moments of our lives.

776
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,920
 That he's brought you out of Egypt

777
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,040
 and he's not left you alone.

778
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,520
 Just because we don't see miracles

779
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,420
 doesn't mean that he's not providing.

780
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,360
 It can discourage us, it can leave us doubting and confused.

781
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,880
 But the truth is that God is truly

782
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,440
 in all of those moments as well.

783
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,720
 He's providing in the big miracles and the small miracles.

784
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,240
 The story of Elam sits as a reminder to us

785
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,360
 to look around and see that maybe it's not

786
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,640
 something spectacular that's happening this week.

787
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,300
 Maybe it's just a regular week where you have like,

788
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,440
 you know that game, not that game,

789
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,160
 that like check-in where it's like,

790
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,800
 give me your highs and give me your lows, right?

791
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,640
 Like the peaks.

792
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,680
 Maybe your week was just, no real highs, no real lows.

793
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,720
 Can you look and see that God is working in that as well?

794
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,760
 Can you find God?

795
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,680
 'Cause again, we're just gonna have so many of those days.

796
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,720
 And it would be a terrible thing for us

797
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,480
 to not be able to see God and see his activity

798
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,500
 in the basic things of every day.

799
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,360
 The second thing is this.

800
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:41,140
 We are at risk of pivoting our dependency from God

801
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,280
 to ourselves when we don't recognize

802
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,180
 God's provision in the ordinary.

803
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:49,980
 This one is, this was the point in the entire preach

804
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,640
 when I was studying and reading that I just felt like,

805
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,400
 like God hit me with.

806
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,040
 Like we, the Elam moments feel so random.

807
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,140
 They just seem so, they're so natural, right?

808
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,080
 Nothing big and spectacular happened.

809
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,800
 And if we're only used to seeing God

810
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,040
 in the big and spectacular,

811
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,400
 perhaps we're tempted to see that Elam

812
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,000
 is a by-product of me, right?

813
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,860
 The temptation easily can be, well, I worked hard.

814
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,460
 Israel had a very good sense of geographical location.

815
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,920
 That's why they found Elam.

816
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
 Or I studied hard, that's why I got this.

817
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,800
 Or I left on time, that's why I got this.

818
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,000
 Or I went out of my way and I was extroverted,

819
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,400
 that's why I have these many friends.

820
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,760
 If we don't recognize God's provision in the little,

821
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,340
 we become little gods ourselves.

822
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,080
 We think that we become dependent on us to get us through.

823
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,800
 And here's why it's problematic.

824
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,000
 Because if you're gonna have so many days of ordinary,

825
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,440
 what ends up happening is that we build our faith on us,

826
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,000
 on us, on us, on us, on us, on us, on us,

827
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,960
 and we reach a moment where we need God

828
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,360
 and we don't even know how to find him.

829
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,520
 And we don't even know that he's actually the one.

830
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,400
 And we depend on ourselves and we end up more broken

831
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,760
 and more disappointed.

832
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,080
 Could we choose to see that in those moments,

833
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,440
 God is the one providing in the small.

834
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,800
 God is the one that is the sustainer of every breath.

835
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,600
 Scripture says that every good and perfect gift

836
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,960
 comes from who?

837
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,800
 Not from me.

838
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,920
 We're not the ones that do it.

839
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,760
 We've got to be able to remind ourselves

840
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,120
 and root ourselves in the daily things,

841
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,560
 the daily bread, the endless grace,

842
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,200
 the mercies that are new every morning.

843
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,960
 All of these are blessings from God.

844
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,400
 They're his provision.

845
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,640
 They may not be big.

846
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
 They may not be glamorous.

847
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,120
 Seas might not be parting, but it's still God.

848
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,800
 Can we see it?

849
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,200
 Can we guard ourselves from the temptation

850
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,780
 to become overly confident in us?

851
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,160
 I think one of the best ways we can do this,

852
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,520
 'cause I don't wanna just leave you with theory,

853
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,960
 I wanna give you something practical.

854
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,360
 One of the best ways, it's super simple, super ordinary,

855
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,080
 which fits the theme of today.

856
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,920
 Thank you.

857
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,760
 Thank you.

858
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,680
 Saying thank you, being thankful,

859
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,840
 small thing, super small thing,

860
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,040
 but saying thank you a couple times a day.

861
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,320
 What will that do for us?

862
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,480
 How will that change the way that we see

863
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,840
 what's happening around us?

864
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,000
 How will that shift our perspective

865
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,860
 or awaken our recognition of the things that God is doing?

866
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,640
 I think if you actually challenge yourself

867
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,800
 to say thank you for the things

868
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,100
 that you're thankful for in your life,

869
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,560
 you'll recognize that daily,

870
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,040
 there are so many things to say thank you for.

871
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,400
 You'll recognize that daily, God is providing.

872
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,600
 You'll recognize that daily,

873
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,740
 God is proving himself to still be with you and for you.

874
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,720
 Simple as saying thank you.

875
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,100
 It's a cute little thing, but man, it goes a long way.

876
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,040
 Could you challenge yourself this week?

877
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,720
 Maybe in the moments where you're tempted

878
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,840
 to complain and be frustrated,

879
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,320
 could you ask yourself, what am I thankful for today?

880
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,520
 What has he given me?

881
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,840
 I know what I'm wanting, I know where I wanna go,

882
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,140
 but what has he done already?

883
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,100
 I'm still here.

884
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,040
 Thank you.

885
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,360
 Try that.

886
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,160
 Genuinely try that this week.

887
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,160
 And see if it doesn't change the posture of our awareness,

888
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,500
 of the activity of God around us.

889
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,340
 Giving thanks is massive.

890
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,160
 And it'll help us to see that he is the God

891
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,300
 in the small as well.

892
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,700
 And here's the third point.

893
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,240
 I believe the third danger is,

894
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,660
 we face in our Exodus journey

895
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,760
 is not recognizing the role of community.

896
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,860
 I'm, for the record, let me, disclaimer,

897
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,460
 I work at the Vine, yes.

898
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,700
 I work on the creative team.

899
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,380
 I am not on the community group's team.

900
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,620
 They did not pay me to say any of this stuff.

901
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,360
 But this text, if you read the text for what it says,

902
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,120
 you can't help but see how essential community is.

903
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,720
 Community is one of God's methods,

904
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,040
 is one of his strategies for providing for us.

905
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,480
 God isn't always going to use small things,

906
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,200
 or big things, or ordinary things, or red seas.

907
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,320
 Sometimes God's gonna use people.

908
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,980
 That's good and bad, 'cause sometimes we don't like people.

909
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,280
 But that ends up being the avenue

910
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,560
 in which God chooses to reveal himself.

911
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,640
 That ends up being the avenue

912
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,240
 in which God chooses to provide for us.

913
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,600
 And if we don't recognize that God's provision

914
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,360
 can often be found through his people,

915
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,500
 then we could find ourselves not prioritizing

916
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,120
 the very community that we're called to be a part of.

917
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,600
 We can find ourselves on the outside

918
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,760
 of the very group that God has called us

919
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,440
 to be a part of to receive his provision.

920
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,440
 The story of Moses, and Aaron, and her, and Joshua

921
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,040
 is so helpful, because it shows us that this,

922
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,040
 that, okay, so Andrew talks about it in the video, right?

923
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,780
 He goes, "I put my hands up for three minutes,

924
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,000
 "and that was too long."

925
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,120
 Now, some of you know this, some of you don't know this,

926
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,440
 but Pastor Andrew works out a lot.

927
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,280
 He goes to a gym, no, he has a home,

928
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,560
 he built a gym in his house.

929
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,060
 Like, he's pumping weights every Wednesday morning.

930
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,040
 And he can only do three minutes.

931
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
 (audience laughing)

932
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,680
 We should check on his routine.

933
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,240
 No, but, this is the 11 o'clock, he's gonna see this.

934
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,400
 Hi, boss.

935
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,680
 Anyways, please don't fire me.

936
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,080
 Okay, cool, back to the point.

937
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,120
 Here's what I'm saying, here's what I'm saying.

938
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,200
 As great as Moses was, his hands weren't enough.

939
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,040
 No, none of us can hold the things God has for us

940
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,980
 on our own, the weight of his provision is heavy.

941
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,500
 And it requires those around you,

942
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,680
 the people that, when you look to your left and your right,

943
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,080
 the people that are here in this community

944
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,200
 to be a part of upholding your hand,

945
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,120
 supporting your arms so that you can see

946
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,800
 God's provision through.

947
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,620
 Will you be bold enough to take a step into community?

948
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,800
 'Cause God doesn't just do it for,

949
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,160
 see, that blessing, that miracle,

950
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,440
 that provision wasn't just for Moses.

951
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,760
 Remember, this is for all the people.

952
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,520
 Right, so one person's ability to be in community

953
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,160
 and to allow the community to support them,

954
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,800
 that's a big one, that's something I'm,

955
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
 whoo, preaching to myself here.

956
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,900
 Allowing your community to actually support you.

957
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,580
 Moses could have said, "Nah, I've got it.

958
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,960
 "I'll work out like Andrew."

959
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,080
 No, right?

960
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,120
 Allowing your community to actually be there for you

961
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,560
 is part of what God has designed community to be.

962
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:27,520
 I know there's, I've had great experiences with community.

963
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,280
 I have some of my best friends actually came to the Vine

964
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
 for the first time today, I won't embarrass you,

965
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,400
 but I was so excited they were here.

966
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,040
 I have great community.

967
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,280
 But I know that's not the case for everyone here.

968
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,720
 I know for some of us, there's some legitimate reasons

969
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,080
 why we're hesitant to be in community.

970
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,800
 Maybe we're really busy, I get that.

971
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,280
 Maybe we were in community before

972
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,560
 and we were stabbed in the back.

973
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,820
 Maybe someone gossiped about us.

974
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,980
 Maybe people have said things.

975
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,100
 Maybe we weren't accepted.

976
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,800
 Maybe we felt like we were on the outs.

977
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,140
 Maybe we never truly fit in.

978
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,460
 I understand that.

979
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,800
 I get that.

980
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,360
 These obstacles are real.

981
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,600
 But can I say that I believe that this community

982
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,400
 here at the Vine can be a community

983
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,840
 that accepts you just how you are.

984
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,360
 This community can be a community that loves you,

985
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,080
 that lifts your arms, that sees you into the provision

986
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,320
 that God has for you.

987
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,120
 I believe that we can be that kind of community.

988
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,080
 And if we can be that kind of community,

989
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,320
 why wouldn't you want that around you?

990
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,760
 If we can be that kind of community,

991
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,960
 what's stopping us now from stepping in

992
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,520
 to actually being with one another,

993
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,780
 not just attending a Sunday?

994
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,220
 My prayer for us here at the Vine is that we can truly

995
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:52,200
 position ourselves to care for our neighbors,

996
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,680
 to recognize those whose arms are tired

997
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,520
 and who cannot be sustained on their own,

998
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,960
 and be proactive to ask to come alongside

999
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,960
 and to support them.

1000
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,880
 My prayer for us, for all of us, is that we will do that.

1001
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,580
 And if we're doing that for one another,

1002
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:14,320
 man, how much is God planning on providing for us?

1003
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,360
 How many things is he gonna provide for that?

1004
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,380
 I just can't wait to see through the people here.

1005
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,420
 Community is so essential.

1006
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,180
 I believe God will call us to consider

1007
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,900
 truly being rooted in community,

1008
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,800
 supporting one another,

1009
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,360
 supporting one another from a place of love,

1010
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,800
 a place of being close, of knowing each other,

1011
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,280
 lifting the arms of those that are tired.

1012
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,860
 So I'm gonna close.

1013
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,920
 My friends, my teams, can we come on up?

1014
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,300
 I genuinely believe this, guys.

1015
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,700
 I really believe we can be that kind of community,

1016
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,560
 the kind of community that chooses to participate

1017
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,320
 in what God is doing in the lives of those around us,

1018
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,180
 the kind of community that lifts the arms

1019
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,600
 and the hands of each other,

1020
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,520
 the kind of community that's close and that's there,

1021
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,220
 that works together.

1022
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:11,160
 I also believe we can be the kind of community

1023
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,740
 that can recognize the activity of God,

1024
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,040
 because it's so important

1025
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,800
 to be able to recognize where God is moving,

1026
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,300
 what he is doing, what he has done.

1027
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,440
 That is just so crucial.

1028
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,700
 From the bottom of my heart,

1029
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,400
 it breaks my actual heart to think

1030
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,000
 that some of us do carry this concept of,

1031
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,240
 where is God, because I don't see the big,

1032
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,440
 and I know that's probably a lot of us here.

1033
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,200
 I know it breaks God's heart

1034
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,520
 that we can't see his activity.

1035
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,720
 And so today, as we enter into a time of prayer

1036
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,920
 and into a chance to respond,

1037
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,720
 I believe what the Holy Spirit wants to do

1038
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,480
 is reposition us to become people who are alert,

1039
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,040
 who are aware.

1040
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,140
 The Holy Spirit wants to help you see

1041
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,540
 what you've not been able to see before,

1042
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,240
 that God cares about the details about your life.

1043
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,400
 God cares about the small.

1044
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,620
 There's a passage that says that he knows

1045
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,840
 the number of hairs on your head.

1046
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,240
 That passage goes to show you

1047
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,360
 that he's aware of the small, of the details.

1048
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,720
 We serve an intimate God

1049
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,440
 who walks with us through all seasons of life,

1050
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,880
 who has an arsenal of ways to provide for us,

1051
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,800
 and I don't want us to miss out on that provision

1052
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,540
 because we only saw the big

1053
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,640
 or because we're outside of community.

1054
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,140
 What does it look like to take a step today?

1055
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:49,160
 What does it look like to choose to say thank you,

1056
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,160
 to actually see that, man, God has been constantly at work

1057
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,900
 providing for me day in and day out?

1058
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:03,040
 God has been working.

1059
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,600
 How can you become better at recognizing it?

1060
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:12,840
 How can you become better and more aligned

1061
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,080
 to his design of community in your life?

1062
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,440
 Father, we thank you for your word.

1063
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,040
 We thank you for these examples

1064
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,920
 that just show us, again, a clear picture

1065
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,680
 of just who you are, of how faithful you are,

1066
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,660
 a faithful God who works and provides

1067
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,640
 even in the small things.

1068
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,800
 Faithful you are.

1069
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,400
 God, I pray for those of us who are having a hard time

1070
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,840
 seeing your provision in the small.

1071
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,800
 Holy Spirit, would you begin to awaken that alertness?

1072
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,140
 Would you begin to show?

1073
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,440
 Would you begin to show us just how often,

1074
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,320
 just how regularly, just how close you are

1075
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,120
 and how often you're providing?

1076
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,020
 Would you remind us of where these good things come from?

1077
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,800
 Would you remind us of where the breath

1078
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,240
 in our lungs come from?

1079
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,060
 The source of all good and perfect things.

1080
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:13,700
 God, for those of us who carry hurt,

1081
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,080
 carry brokenness over the idea of community,

1082
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,040
 those of us who are afraid to take a step into community

1083
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,540
 because we're ashamed, because we've been hurt,

1084
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,580
 because we've not recovered from past pains,

1085
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,120
 Holy Spirit, would you begin to start working now

1086
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:29,960
 in our hearts?

1087
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,840
 Start mending like you do.

1088
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,420
 Start healing like you do.

1089
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,060
 Start making the old things new like you do.

1090
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,540
 May the idea of hurt in the past no longer hinder your people

1091
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,100
 from being in the place of community

1092
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,600
 that you've called them to be.

1093
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,400
 God, would you make us a community that is sensitive,

1094
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,720
 that is patient, that is kind, that exhibits your fruit

1095
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,400
 so that when people do come in,

1096
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,840
 that we will lift their hands and not judge,

1097
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,120
 that we will welcome and not stand back,

1098
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,320
 that we will treat them the way that you've treated us,

1099
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,020
 the way that you've welcomed us into your family, God.

1100
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,440
 Make us into that type of people.

1101
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,940
 Make the vine here in Luncheye the kind of church

1102
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,780
 that's like that.

1103
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,340
 We give you glory for all these things.

1104
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,100
 God who provides in the big and the small,

1105
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,740
 the God who calls us as a community

1106
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,100
 to experience this provision together,

1107
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,620
 we thank you for these things.

1108
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:33,660
 Why don't you stand, church?
