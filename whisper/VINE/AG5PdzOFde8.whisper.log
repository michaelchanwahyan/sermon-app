[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Thank you, worship team.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Thank you, everyone.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.860]   Say hello to somebody as you sit down.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.160]   Well, we are really excited that we continue to be
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.800]   in our Exodus series, which has been just such an amazing
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.160]   journey for us as a church.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.920]   And today we get the privilege of having
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.760]   our two founding pastors share our message today.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.480]   So would you give a very warm welcome
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.880]   as I introduce firstly, John Snellgrove, Pastor John.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.560]   It's so good to have you here.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.400]   It's so good.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.520]   And Sandra was here earlier as well.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.080]   It's such a great honor to have you stand
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.000]   and share a message.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.120]   And I know that there's a new season going for you
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.200]   and Sandra as well, Priscilla and Aquila,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.240]   I believe it's called.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.040]   And this really is an opportunity for John and Sandra
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.840]   to empower the global church, encourage the global church
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.320]   in their continuous faith journey
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.020]   and to really equip the younger generation,
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.120]   which is really exciting.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.240]   And if you wanna find out more,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.320]   then the details are showing up on the screen.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.480]   Do contact John and Sandra.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.120]   I'm sure that they would love to tell you more about it.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.600]   So let us pray for John and Tony.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.880]   Father, we thank you.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.720]   We thank you for the opportunity we have to listen
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.840]   and hear the wisdom from John and Tony.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.320]   And I pray that you would bless John as he shares right now
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.680]   and that our hearts would really receive what it is
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.480]   that you have for us in Jesus name, amen.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.760]   - Amen, thank you, Carla.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.480]   And good morning, church.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.920]   - Good morning.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.360]   - Good.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.360]   You are not able to go it alone.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.560]   Can you turn to the person next to you and tell them also,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.440]   you are not able to go it alone.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.040]   I noticed something here in Hong Kong.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.880]   When you ask someone the question, how are you?
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.680]   I invariably get the answer.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.580]   You know what I'm gonna say, don't you?
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.800]   I'm busy.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   Busyness in a city of business is seen like a badge of merit.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.940]   I'm busy because I'm important.
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.400]   And yet Moses was in many ways like that.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.600]   Yes, our hero of the Exodus
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.820]   and the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.680]   And as we look today how he dealt with it,
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.760]   I am praying for us.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.440]   That we would each experience a personal Exodus
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.440]   from the need to be busy.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.500]   To be the person who has to do everything
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.680]   so that the world continues to take over.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   There is a term which is more and more frequently employed
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.640]   in Christian circles, which depicts a problem
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.760]   that has been widespread amongst evangelicals,
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.280]   even epidemic.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.640]   And that term is burnout.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.800]   Burnout happens frequently to Christian leaders
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.880]   who strive to make impossible expectations and demands.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.240]   The achievement of which will show him or her
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.860]   to be both spiritual and successful.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.840]   Failure to accomplish these expectations and demands
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.160]   is believed to prove one lazy,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.620]   unspiritually minded or a failure.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   Burnout occurs when in sheer exhaustion and frustration,
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.240]   we lose all hope of meeting the standard
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.660]   which is imposed on us either by ourselves, others or both.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.920]   And we simply give up.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.640]   And burnout is not just a phenomenon found
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.760]   in Christian leaders or just among Christians
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.520]   for that matter.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.840]   Burnout is caused by the sheer volume
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.840]   of non-essential activities, which we foolishly,
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.740]   foolishly strive to maintain.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.820]   Are you guilty?
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.920]   I know I am.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:02.360]   And Moses' answer comes in the unlikely shape
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.220]   of a visit from his father-in-law.
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.560]   I mean, there are lots of mother-in-law jokes,
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.760]   but there's very few father-in-law jokes.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.880]   Moses was dangerously close to burning himself out
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.960]   when of all people, his father-in-law came to his rescue.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.640]   What appears on the surface to be the insignificant visit
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.760]   of a relative is really a divine provision
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.340]   to deliver Moses.
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.760]   Not from the wrath of Pharaoh,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.160]   nor from the attack of the Egyptian army,
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.560]   but to deliver him from himself.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.600]   Now as Jethro, that's the name of the father-in-law
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.280]   by the way, it's nothing to do with the vine worship leader.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.240]   As Jethro himself puts it,
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.520]   Moses was weary himself and the Israelites out.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.360]   Look at this, verse 18.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.060]   You and these people who come to you
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.120]   will only wear yourselves out.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.700]   The work is too heavy for you.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.660]   You cannot handle it alone.
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.160]   You cannot handle it alone.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.660]   Thanks to the common sense of a wise father-in-law,
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.160]   Moses was delivered from his own destruction.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.360]   The burnout which resulted from a distorted perception
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.700]   and a too demanding ministry.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.900]   We're gonna be looking today at Exodus 18
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.460]   and the text of chapter 18 divides evenly
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.300]   into two simple and straightforward portions.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.540]   Verses one to 12, which I will summarize
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.140]   by the title Jethro's Arrival.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.140]   And verses 13 to 27, which will depict Jethro's advice.
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.460]   The two portions are very much related.
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.820]   As a spoiler alert, we will have a film from Egypt
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.020]   at the halftime mark and a special guest,
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.440]   the vine's own Jethro in part two.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.100]   The first half of the chapter reveals several symptoms
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.100]   of a serious problems in Moses' life,
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.820]   which prompted not only the arrival of Jethro
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.660]   at the Israelites camp, but also his advice.
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:51.780]   We would do well to listen to the wise words
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.400]   of this Midianite, who has much to teach us
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.360]   about managing our lives and our ministries.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.600]   For those of us like me, who are predisposed
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.580]   to busyness and over involvement,
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.740]   they can spare us from the deadly disease of burnouts.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:23.480]   The first section verses one to 12,
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.220]   which I've called Jethro's Arrival,
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.040]   breaks evenly into two divisions.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.740]   The first division, verses one to six,
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.340]   might be entitled Focus on the Family.
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.920]   They reveal the occasion,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.880]   the reason for the arrival of Jethro.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.680]   Verse one informs us of the basis
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.900]   for Jethro's decision to visit Moses,
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.380]   whilst verses two to six tell us
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.120]   of the purpose of that visit.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.480]   The second division, verses seven to 12,
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.000]   focus on the faith of Jethro.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.940]   They depict the outcome of Jethro's arrival.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.780]   Moses gets the chance to report
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.780]   on God's good hand to the Israelites,
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.140]   and Jethro responds to God's goodness to Israel,
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.600]   rejoicing, proclaiming God's greatness,
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   and worshiping him with Moses and the elders of Israel.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.560]   But this is not the 21st century.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.640]   It's difficult for me to envision
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.520]   just how Jethro gathered the information
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.720]   about the well-being of Moses.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.260]   There was no Facebook or IG, or even CNN at the time.
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.600]   But the text tells us, verse one,
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   he heard everything God had done for Moses and his people.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.480]   Perhaps Jethro had made a point to invite travelers,
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.080]   even caravans, to share a meal with him,
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.960]   or spend the night in his tent,
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.480]   enable him to learn the things about Egypt.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.480]   The point of the passage is not how Jethro learned
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.440]   of Moses' well-being, but of what he learned.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.520]   He learned that God had protected Moses,
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.520]   and that he had delivered the Israelites out of Egypt.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.520]   Jethro had learned enough to conclude
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.620]   that the circumstances were such
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.620]   that Moses and his family should be reunited.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.640]   And verses two to six indicate the purpose
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.340]   of Jethro's visit to Moses, to reunite Zipporah,
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:53.560]   his daughter, Moses' wife, and Gershom and Eliezer,
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.560]   the grandsons, Moses' sons, with Moses.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.520]   It was apparently a pleasant surprise for Moses.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.000]   But whilst we might have expected him
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   to pay much more attention to his wife
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.800]   and children coming back, we read that Moses
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.440]   is reported to have immediately gone to meet Jethro,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.220]   kissed him, and then go to Jethro's tent to meet with him.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:28.720]   Inside the tent, Moses and Jethro went through
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.000]   the formalities of a reception of an honored guest
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.480]   in Oriental culture, in Eastern culture.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   Moses brought Jethro up to date with a detailed report
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.520]   of how the hand of God had delivered the Israelites
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.920]   and devastated the Egyptians.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.120]   Verse eight, Moses told his father-in-law
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.760]   about everything the Lord had done to Pharaoh
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.200]   and the Egyptians for Israel's sake,
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.160]   and about all the hardships they had met along the way,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.540]   and how the Lord had saved them.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:12.000]   Jethro's response, described in verses nine to 12,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.680]   seems to be more than just Oriental courtesy.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.680]   It appears that Jethro here professes a personal faith
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.120]   in the God of Israel, which as a pagan,
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.700]   he had not previously.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.060]   First, Jethro rejoiced with Moses, praising God
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.240]   for his grace manifested towards Israel
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.460]   as evidenced by Moses' report.
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.700]   We read this in verse nine and 10.
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.580]   Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.780]   the Lord had done for Israel in rescuing them
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.900]   from the hands of the Egyptian.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.220]   He said, "Praise be to the Lord, who has rescued you
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.280]   "from the hands of the Egyptian and of Pharaoh,
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.620]   "and who rescued the people from the hands of the Egyptian."
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.620]   Secondly, Jethro seems to acknowledge for the first time
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.860]   the superiority of God above all other gods,
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.500]   which one would have supposed would have included
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.420]   his previously worshiped pagan gods.
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.360]   Jethro's faith is demonstrated in the offering
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.940]   of sacrifices to God and the sacrificial meal,
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.940]   which Jethro, Moses, and all the elders of Israel shared.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.920]   Verse 11 says this.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.400]   "Now I know that the Lord is greater
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.920]   "than all the other gods, for he did this to those
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.760]   "who had treated Israel arrogantly.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.800]   "Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.600]   "and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.860]   "with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:58.080]   "with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God."
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.600]   Therefore, for Moses, this was a happy occasion,
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.640]   not only because of Israel's victory over Amalek,
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.480]   but because of the renewed fellowship
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.440]   and the renewed relationship with his wife and his family.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.740]   But it leads me to a but, and it's a big but.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.740]   Having briefly considered the arrival of Jethro
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.820]   and Moses' family and the affirmation of Jethro's faith,
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.920]   I'm left with a nagging question.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:40.940]   Why was it, why was it that Jethro had to initiate
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:45.180]   the reunion of Moses and his family?
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.180]   Put it differently, why didn't Moses send
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.340]   for his wife and sons, rather than have Jethro
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.220]   show up with them unexpectedly?
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:04.340]   Now, we have a tendency, don't we, to assume the best
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:10.100]   of our biblical heroes, like Moses, David, Abraham, et cetera.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.780]   I call it the pious bias.
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.500]   It seeks to elevate biblical characters
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.340]   to a level far above our own performance
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.800]   and far above what we would expect, knowing man's nature.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.220]   By the way, not Jesus, I'm saying, okay?
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:35.460]   But when we come to chapter 18, it is not Moses' strengths,
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:40.820]   it is not his virtues, which are extolled in this chapter,
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.040]   but his weaknesses.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   Now, here is a man, Moses, that I can identify with,
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.760]   a man with flaws like mine.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.080]   And these flaws are keenly observed by Jethro,
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   whose advice in verses 13 to 27 is based upon
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.240]   his observation of Moses' unconscious blunders,
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.840]   both with regard to his family, and as you shall see later,
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.500]   his function as Israel's leader.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:22.600]   Let us press on to see how the events of verses one to 12
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:29.160]   serve as a clue to the failures which Jethro seeks to remedy
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.460]   by his wisdom and counsel.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:38.420]   To prepare us, let's go to Egypt,
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.080]   and to an interview that Pastor Andrew had
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.600]   with Father Justin, not you, by the way.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:51.440]   One of the head monks at St. Catherine's Monastery
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.300]   at the foothills of Mount Sinai.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:02.180]   (gentle music)
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.840]   (water rushing)
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.420]   (gentle music)
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.080]   (water rushing)
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.660]   (gentle music)
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.320]   (water rushing)
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.900]   (gentle music)
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:26.680]   (water rushing)
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:39.260]   (gentle music)
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.920]   (water rushing)
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:56.180]   - Father Justin, it is such a privilege
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.100]   to be with you today and to see this incredible library.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.260]   I can't wait to kind of look around
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.180]   and have you show me some of the things that are here.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:08.580]   - Well, there have been monks living here for 1,700 years.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.580]   The library we have has been slowly built up
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.940]   over the centuries, and people have said
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.140]   it's the memory of the monastery, so it's a great treasure.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.680]   (gentle music)
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.780]   This is the most illuminated manuscript
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.180]   of the latter that we have.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.780]   The passage that I opened it to
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.220]   is when he discusses discretion.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.460]   He says the greatest gift is discretion
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.180]   because discretion is knowing
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.420]   how to make spiritual decisions,
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.980]   how to weigh things, how to know the way forward.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:04.820]   And he illustrates that by having three monks.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.060]   The one is still lying in bed, half asleep.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.380]   The other one is middle-aged,
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.540]   and he's standing in the center.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.580]   And then the other one has attained, under old age,
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.460]   you see his white hair and his beard,
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.860]   and he is being crowned by Christ
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.580]   who appears from the corner, and he's blessing him.
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.060]   - Yeah, I was gonna ask you if that was Christ.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.580]   - So this is the person
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.540]   who's just beginning the spiritual life,
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.460]   the one who has reached the middle stage,
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.460]   and the one who has reached the summit.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.860]   - And when you're fathering the younger monks
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.180]   in the monastery here,
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.980]   this kind of process of spiritual discipleship, I suppose,
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.740]   is that in your mind
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.260]   as you're leading the younger monks
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.940]   through their life here?
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.340]   - One of the beautiful things, not just in monasteries,
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.660]   but in the whole Orthodox Church,
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.060]   is that we are not expected to do this by ourselves.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.060]   We look to others who have experienced grace,
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.980]   who have grown in the Spirit,
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.620]   and we follow their example,
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.340]   and we receive their instructions.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:14.260]   So it's an essential part,
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.700]   especially at the beginning of the spiritual life,
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.180]   to have direction, to have guidance.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.540]   Many times we think that we're doing very well,
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.660]   and we're not.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.260]   Many times we think that we're not doing very well at all,
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.100]   and we are.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.220]   So it's through experience
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.660]   that a person can set us on the right path
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.980]   and make sure that we're going in the right direction.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.740]   - Well, I'd love to actually sit down with you
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.900]   and talk a little bit more about that relationship
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.380]   between being a spiritual father
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.540]   and the monks here in the monastery.
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.060]   So perhaps we can go and sit down together
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.020]   and have a chat. - Fine.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.020]   - Thank you so much for showing me this.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:21:00.140]   Father Justin, that manuscript you just showed us
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.740]   of the three figures
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.060]   kind of in their various different states, I suppose,
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.540]   of spiritual maturity,
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.860]   really opens up for me a topic
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.820]   that I'm very interested in exploring with you
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.340]   around that whole sort of sense of being a spiritual father
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.860]   within the Orthodox community.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.380]   And I'd love to just get a sense from you,
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.140]   what does that look like?
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.940]   What does that sort of spiritual father
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.180]   to the junior monk relationship look like
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.660]   within this community?
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.060]   - A monastery usually has one person
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.620]   who is very responsible for the spiritual formation,
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.900]   especially of those who have just arrived.
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:40.900]   And in Sinai, the senior father
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.780]   under the archbishop is called the dikeos.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.700]   The dikeos is a superior.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.460]   And one of his primary obligations
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.420]   is the spiritual formation of the novices.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:56.380]   So that's how he conveys to them the spiritual heritage
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.260]   and the spiritual witness of the monastery.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.780]   So when you read the sayings of the desert fathers,
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.780]   these are just short anecdotes.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.420]   A person went to a monk and asked him this question,
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.700]   he gave this answer.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.100]   And it's profound, and it's just a short saying.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.780]   So they're very approachable,
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.540]   but those are some of the earliest monastic texts
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.820]   that I read.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.580]   And I was so enthused by everything that I read,
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.020]   I was wondering, are there still people
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.300]   that live like this?
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.980]   That was my own beginnings.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.980]   And I think that everyone goes back to that first experience
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.620]   when they think about the monastic life
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.260]   and the groundwork that they laid.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.980]   And they understood from experience
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.180]   that you have a person who is more mature,
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.900]   more experienced, who can guide a person
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.900]   who's just starting out in the spiritual life.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.460]   So that tradition of the elder and the disciple
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.660]   goes back to the very beginning.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.980]   The most important book written here at Sinai
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.820]   is called "The Ladder of Divine Ascent."
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.660]   And if you look carefully, you can see how he was drawing
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.820]   on that whole tradition of the Desert Fathers.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.700]   He describes the spiritual life like a ladder,
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.500]   when you start for the first rung
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.140]   and go to the second rung with Christ at the summit,
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.380]   summoning us to make the spiritual ascent.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.540]   And when we first start out, we need care.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.580]   - Right.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.620]   - He mentions that when you have been in a monastery
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.380]   for a short time, many times you are thinking,
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.980]   well, now I've reached perfection, I can go back home,
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.980]   I can become the great preacher, I can bring out a vacation.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.780]   So from the very beginning, you need discretion
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.340]   to know which thoughts that are coming to you
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:50.340]   are to your benefit and which ones are undermining your goal.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:56.620]   And you gain that by having an experienced elder
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:02.340]   who can guide you, not only theoretically,
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.020]   but based on his own experience.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.900]   One person said, "It's not a little stream
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.140]   "that we jump over, it's like a great ocean."
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.020]   And no matter how tall a person is,
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.500]   when he wades out into the ocean,
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.420]   he finds things that are over his head.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:19.420]   So it's a very profound understanding,
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.740]   and it's a process that continues his whole life.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.340]   (gentle music)
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:36.260]   - Father Justin, I also wanted to ask you a little bit
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.940]   about what a day in the life is like
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.900]   for a monk in the monastery here.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.780]   Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.900]   - It's centered around the services.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.500]   The first service is at four in the morning.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.300]   Four in the morning, all the stars are out
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.540]   in the desert sky, and it's beautiful
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.020]   to have a service in the quietest part of the day.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.540]   The service lasts until seven o'clock in the morning,
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.580]   and by that time, the sun has come up
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.340]   and a new day has begun.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.780]   And it's beautiful to watch the light
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.140]   slowly increase in the church.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.300]   - And in the service, it's readings?
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.900]   - Reading from the Psalms,
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.780]   the hymns for the saints of the day.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.460]   We celebrate the liturgy here every day,
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.820]   and so that's the morning service.
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.660]   We have a short service at noon.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.260]   We have vespers in the afternoon.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.220]   So the beginning, the middle, and the end of the day
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.860]   is spent in the services.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.100]   And I think because the community is so small,
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.100]   there's a sense that we're more like a family.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.220]   - And what does this family mean to you?
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.300]   I mean, you've obviously been a part of this family
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.860]   for many years, as you were sharing with us earlier.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.620]   What does it mean for you to actually have
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.180]   that kind of family so consistently in your life?
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.900]   - There's an amazing balance.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.980]   You have your personal space,
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.420]   but you also have this sense of community.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.780]   And the one doesn't intrude on the other.
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.500]   I think they're both necessary
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.420]   'cause you must be yourself.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   There's no, what you would call, institutionalization
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.700]   where a person conforms to something.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.860]   A person remains himself, but at the same time,
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.660]   he becomes a part of this larger whole.
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.940]   And as I mentioned, there's this beautiful balance
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.700]   between personal space and being part of a community.
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.540]   - Wonderful.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.300]   You're gonna show me some other places in the monastery.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.140]   Shall we go? - Yes.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:49.020]   - Father Justin, I wanted to also ask
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.060]   about the wisdom tradition and the role
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.660]   that maybe the wisdom books play in your order as well.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.220]   We've talked quite a bit about the Psalms
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.180]   and obviously the big influence they have,
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.100]   but how does wisdom traditions play within the order?
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.820]   - We read the entire book of Proverbs
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.340]   during Great Lent in the services.
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.940]   And the wisdom that he imparts
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.820]   is very much a part of our tradition.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.660]   And there's such a similarity
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.260]   between the inherited wisdom
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.540]   that is enshrined in the book of Proverbs
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.980]   and the sayings of the Desert Fathers,
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.980]   which is lived experience, solutions,
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.820]   memorable sayings, memorable events
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.220]   that have all been collected
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.100]   and then passed down from one generation to another.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.100]   The beautiful thing about living at a place like this
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.180]   is that every day you have a greater appreciation
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.820]   and a greater sense of the significance of the tradition,
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.100]   the significance of the place
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.380]   and everything that you experience here.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.620]   It's constantly growing and knowledge and wisdom
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.700]   and a beautiful process that never has an end.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.020]   - And that's the thing that I think
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.900]   you've really impressed on me over our time together
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.220]   is that it's this wonderful combination
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.700]   between theology, between practice,
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.620]   the services of worship you have,
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.180]   but then the lived experience
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.780]   and doing that in community together.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.780]   And all of that working together
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:21.060]   to really create that spiritual formation as a community.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.500]   I think that's profound.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:39.500]   - Thanks.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.980]   While I'm waiting, that was quite some beard, wasn't it?
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.180]   So let's move on with our story.
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:50.900]   The next morning, Moses and the people of Israel
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.260]   began their daily routine.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.060]   The people who sought to know God's will from Moses
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.700]   began to line up at the designated place,
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.420]   perhaps just outside Moses' tent.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.660]   With a nation composed, as Andrew told us in previous weeks,
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.100]   of nearly two million people,
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.580]   one could imagine the line was long
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:24.220]   and that it began to queue up very early in the morning.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.020]   I don't know if it's four o'clock or not.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.540]   Moses, we are told, seated himself
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:37.180]   sitting as Israel's sole judge.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.020]   Let's read this.
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.780]   The next day, Moses took his seat
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.700]   to serve as judge for the people.
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.620]   And they stood around him from morning till evening.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.780]   When his father-in-law saw all that Moses
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.820]   was doing for the people, he said,
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:59.300]   what is this that you're doing for the people?
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.020]   Why do you alone sit as judge?
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.980]   Why are all these people stand around you
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.420]   from morning until evening?
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:15.340]   You see, the people came to him with all those matters
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.820]   which needed a decision, an instruction, or counsel.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.580]   The people looked to Moses alone for a word from God
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.220]   for guidance in their lives.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.740]   At the end of the day,
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:34.380]   the long line of waiting Israelites was still there.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:39.380]   Jethro was able to quickly identify the problem
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.660]   to which it seems Moses was oblivious.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.580]   Jethro was baffled by the inefficiency
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.660]   of what had taken place during the day.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.340]   So perhaps over dinner that night,
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:57.140]   they sat around and Jethro began to inquire
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.260]   about Moses' rationale for administering justice,
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.460]   judging as he was doing.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.460]   It was apparent from Jethro's questioning
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.140]   that he did not agree with the way
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:16.460]   that Moses was doing things.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.260]   Even the way the questions are phrased in writing,
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.220]   you can imagine the tone of voice which he asked.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.820]   Father-in-law, as you know,
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.900]   can do a better job than others on this.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.020]   He usually starts with a question.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:33.100]   Are you a good enough man to be my daughter's husband?
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:40.140]   I believe Moses was completely caught off guard
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.620]   by Jethro's disapproval.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:47.820]   Moses was so engrossed in his work,
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.020]   so desperately trying to keep his head above water
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.860]   that he didn't have time to reflect on what he was doing.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.780]   Jethro, on the other hand,
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:04.780]   had already suspected a problem for some time.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.580]   Moses had not only sent his family home
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.300]   for Jethro to care for,
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.500]   but apparently he'd had little contact with them
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.200]   and he delayed in reuniting with his family.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:23.840]   That morning, Jethro began to see the pieces
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.100]   fall into place.
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:31.020]   Moses had not sent for his family.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:31.860]   Why?
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:37.740]   Because he did not have time to care for them,
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.400]   even to think of them.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:46.220]   The response of Moses reveals his distorted perception,
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.380]   which was the root problem here.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.180]   Moses answered him,
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.980]   because the people come to me to seek God's will.
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.500]   Whenever they have a dispute,
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.500]   it is brought to me and I decide between the parties
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:06.500]   and inform them of God's decrees and instruction.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:11.180]   While Jethro quickly sized up the situation,
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.700]   Moses wasn't thinking very carefully
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.220]   about what he was doing.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:20.220]   His response reveals several misconceptions
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.360]   regarding his role as a leader.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.580]   Consider them with me for a moment.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.580]   Firstly, Moses believed that every request for help
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:38.540]   made the matter his responsibility.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:43.260]   Secondly, Moses seemed to assume
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:48.860]   that because the people came to him personally for help,
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:53.380]   it was his responsibility to help them personally.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:59.260]   Thirdly, Moses wrongly reasoned that because his task
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.780]   was to lead the entire nation,
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:05.180]   he must do it by dealing with people one at a time.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:11.780]   Fourthly, Moses seemed to have assumed that no one else,
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.820]   no one else was able to do what he was doing.
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:20.900]   And most importantly, Moses seems to have lost sight
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.160]   of his unique gifts and calling.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.120]   Let me repeat that.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.480]   Moses seems to have lost sight
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.920]   of his unique gifts and calling.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.960]   God had not called Moses to do everything,
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.880]   but to do some things.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.460]   Moses was given responsibility
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.920]   to lead the nation of Israel as a whole.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.840]   And therefore, his task was very different
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.440]   from that of others who could deal with people
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.440]   on a personal, intimate, one-on-one basis.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:08.980]   I believe that we can gather several important principles
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:13.520]   of leadership from the words of Jethro
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.360]   which are addressed to Moses.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:21.620]   And to help me, I want to introduce my very own Jethro.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.520]   Not my father-in-law.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:30.480]   But a wise, can I say older?
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:36.300]   Okay, you know we're 150 between us,
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.980]   you know, just telling you that.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.540]   You gotta work out how that's balanced out.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.540]   But God sent this man to me
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.480]   and to this church to impart common sense
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.040]   and generational wisdom.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.160]   Tony will address these principles
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.880]   and their practical information.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.980]   So let's welcome Tony.
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.140]   [audience applauding]
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.040]   >> Well, thank you.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:14.660]   It's good to be here and to be able to talk on this as well.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.700]   We need to hear now, not from Moses' problems,
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.180]   but to Jethro's advice.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.620]   And we're gonna do that firstly by reading
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.180]   exactly what it was that Jethro said.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:33.180]   So here in chapter 18, Jethro is speaking
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.820]   and he's speaking to Moses.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.140]   And he says this.
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:41.140]   Listen now to me and I will give you some advice
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.860]   and may God be with you.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:49.360]   You, you must be the people's representative before God
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.920]   and bring their disputes to him.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.820]   Teach them his decrees and instructions
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.340]   and show them the way that they should live.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:06.400]   But select capable men from all the people,
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.960]   men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain,
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.840]   and appoint them as officials over thousands,
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.680]   hundreds, fifties, and tens.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:22.120]   Have them serve as judges for the people at all times.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:27.280]   But for the simple cases, they can decide themselves.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.860]   That will make your load lighter
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.020]   because they will share it with you.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.480]   If you do this and God so commands,
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.800]   you will be able to stand the strain
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.380]   and all these people will go home satisfied.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:46.620]   Now we need to just step back a moment here
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.200]   and see that what Moses was doing
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.900]   was hindering the fundamental reason
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.200]   that the people were on this journey.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.060]   They were on this journey to seek their freedom.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.280]   It was for freedom that they were in the desert
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.900]   and leading to that promised land.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.680]   Jethro is sensing, quite rightly,
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.880]   that their journey of freedom
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.880]   is turning into one of resentment and exhaustion.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.880]   I want to summarize the advice
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.040]   by bringing out four general principles of leadership.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.040]   The first one of these
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.700]   is the principle of control and release.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.060]   Now you might think from a quick reading of this passage
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.900]   that Jethro's advice was intended to release Moses
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.300]   and to maintain control of the people.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.660]   But actually, it was the other way around
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:47.260]   because the principle role of Christian leadership
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:52.260]   is to lead people out of slavery and into freedom.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.900]   In order to do this effectively,
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.900]   the leader must maintain control of themselves first
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.580]   and not the people.
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:07.900]   And when the leader is in control of himself or herself,
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.840]   then the people will respond and follow.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.620]   If it's not done well,
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.500]   then the leaders will have difficulty in leading
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.700]   because of the lack of confidence
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.260]   that they perceive in the leader himself.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.180]   And Jethro's advice to Moses
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:29.240]   involved a specific sort of pyramid arrangement
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.880]   of organizational model.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.700]   And it was designed to relieve the burden on Moses, yes,
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:42.540]   but also to release the people into leadership.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.980]   And that model perhaps was appropriate
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:49.240]   for slaves who had only experienced slavery
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.060]   in their lifetime,
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.260]   but it was not an ordained model
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.300]   that was divinely appointed
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.020]   for all Christian assemblies thereafter.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.720]   The significant thing about Jethro's advice
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.720]   was in its outcome to restore the journey of freedom
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.400]   and not in the specific organizational model
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.240]   that he spoke about.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.620]   So the first principle of leadership is this,
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:23.400]   that leaders need to be in control of themselves first
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.760]   before they can release others.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.100]   The second principle I want to talk about
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.840]   is the principle of the servant and master.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:37.020]   You see, God has given each of us giftings
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.780]   which we can use in our leadership.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.900]   But leadership itself is not a specific gift from God
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.480]   because there are many different types of leadership.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:54.020]   But Jethro provides some solid advice to Moses
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:57.960]   on how to exercise his specific role
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:04.560]   and how he should release the people into their role.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.720]   But more importantly, he gave him some advice
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.860]   on the qualities of the people
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.120]   that he should be looking for.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:17.400]   He said, "But select capable men,
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:22.820]   "men from all the people who secondly fear God,
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.620]   "thirdly, who are trustworthy,
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.900]   "and men who hate dishonest gain."
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.280]   And that would be the sense of having
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.580]   a sense of justice within their heart.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:38.360]   And Jethro wanted to make sure that these men
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:43.280]   would be able to carry out their duties as servants
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.300]   and not as overlords or masters.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.560]   We might use different wording in our Christian context,
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.560]   but these qualities of servanthood
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.160]   that he outlined are important
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.960]   no matter what sort of leadership gifting that we have.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.120]   And it's in this context of servanthood
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.560]   that we need to work on the basic skills and gifts
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.560]   that God has given us so that we can master those gifts
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.640]   and use them well in leadership itself.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   Some leaders are gifted organizational managers.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.120]   Some are inspirational speakers.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.560]   Others may be knowledgeable scholars.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.280]   Others may use authenticity
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.640]   and life experience to lead others.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:42.040]   There are many ways of types of leadership
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.880]   that we can experience and use.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.560]   But whatever type of leadership you have,
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:51.200]   then the second principle of leadership is this.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:56.200]   Leaders are called to lead as servants of Christ
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:00.000]   by mastering the gifts that they have been given.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.600]   And the third principle I want to talk to
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.880]   is that of the shepherd and the sheep.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.560]   In a church setting, the role of the shepherd
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.680]   is to lead the flock to safe pastures
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:18.680]   where they can be cared for and protected.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.640]   In doing this, she or he is providing
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.960]   a collective leadership for the flock.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.860]   But what happens if one of the sheep
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.400]   goes astray and gets lost?
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.200]   Well, we know from our New Testament parables
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.480]   that in that occasion, the shepherd goes
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.680]   and leaves the 99 to find the one.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.840]   But in a large church, it will be impossible
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.880]   for one leader to know each individual person
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.920]   by name and their circumstances.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.160]   And just as Jethro suggested,
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.000]   it will be important to train up other leaders
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.760]   who can provide that important element
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.080]   of personal engagement and shepherding.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:08.080]   And this is why the development of communities is important.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.240]   In Moses' day, it was possible for him
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.200]   to use the natural structure of the tribes
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.680]   and families that existed around them.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.360]   But in our highly mobile societies,
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.320]   we need to be much more intentional
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.400]   in developing and nurturing communities
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.880]   where people can find greater spiritual
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.580]   and relational support.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:37.040]   And so at the Vine, we place great importance
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.160]   to our community groups as places
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.280]   where people can experience and learn
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:47.920]   and how to engage with different personalities and cultures.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.720]   It's in that setting that we can learn
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.440]   how to support each other, sharing life together,
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.880]   and putting into practice the teachings that we receive.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.240]   These groups are great incubators
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:07.540]   to learn leadership skills and to exercise our gifts
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.680]   and to grow in spiritual maturity.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.480]   So the third principle of leadership is this.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.800]   Shepherding is the caring and nurturing of the sheep
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:24.160]   so that they can in turn become the shepherds of others.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.580]   And the fourth and final principle
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:29.680]   that I want to talk about
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.680]   is the principle of the one and many.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.120]   Because at whatever level of leadership we find ourselves,
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.320]   we need to learn how to manage ourselves
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.220]   and how to manage others.
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.440]   And I'm not talking about having to get an MBA here,
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.880]   but I'm talking about the basic skills
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.280]   of organizing ourselves and our activities
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.520]   to achieve our goals.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:57.120]   As our responsibilities increase,
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:01.240]   we will undoubtedly need to interact with others
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:06.240]   in teamwork and shared leadership situations
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.840]   become the requirement of the day.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:14.840]   You see, leadership is rarely a solo activity
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:20.560]   because of the sheer complexity of the lives we lead
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.780]   and the situations that we find ourselves in.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.360]   And at the Vine, we have many levels
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.680]   of shared leadership responsibilities.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:34.640]   We practice shared leadership in our staff organization.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.880]   We practice it in our eldership
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.600]   and in all of our ministries where possible.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.840]   And at one time in the past,
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.160]   the church was even run by an eldership
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.780]   as a shared leadership responsibility
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.200]   without any full-time pastors at all.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.800]   And our first full-time pastoral leadership
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.440]   was a dual appointment of John and myself
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.640]   as co-senior pastors
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.920]   in which we led the church together
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.500]   and using our complimentary gifts.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.200]   And I say this only to emphasize
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:16.200]   that shared leadership is very much in our blood as a church
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:21.800]   and from it, we can learn so much about life and ourselves.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:25.940]   So the fourth and final principle of leadership is this.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:30.700]   Church leadership is seldom a solo activity.
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.560]   Practicing shared leadership together
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.680]   will produce a healthy, growing community.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.520]   Thank you.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:43.120]   (audience applauding)
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:50.480]   - The principles which Moses learned from Jethro
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.040]   are applicable to every Christian,
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.480]   whether he or she is a leader or not.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:02.300]   So as we conclude, I wanna consider some initial steps
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:06.020]   which may get us started on our way
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:09.700]   to becoming better leaders and managers.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.180]   Number one is simple.
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.420]   Find a Jethro.
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:22.060]   God gave Moses a Jethro to point out his problems.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:27.980]   Fortunately, God gave me a Jethro in Tony and others.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:32.700]   If you do not have such a friend, get one.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:39.400]   Number two, establish a plan for both your private world
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.300]   and your public ministry
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:46.200]   and determine not to neglect either.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.160]   This is big.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.620]   Determine the priorities which will govern those things
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:58.620]   that you will do and those you will turn down.
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:04.460]   Of all the things you could do,
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:10.300]   seek to identify and achieve those things you should do.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:16.460]   Number three, determine to facilitate
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:20.460]   the ministry of others, especially by encouraging
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.340]   and equipping them to do what they do best.
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:28.340]   In other words, begin to focus as a Jethro.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:32.000]   Now, I know I've asked you just to find a Jethro,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.100]   but begin to focus as a Jethro
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.260]   to the many Moseses around you.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:44.180]   And lastly, desire to grow in faith
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.720]   and at the same time, humility.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:52.760]   Faith is required to trust God to enable you
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.180]   to do what he's called you to do.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.940]   Faith is also required to enable you to leave
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:02.800]   what you should not do to others.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:09.060]   Humility will keep you from self-trust,
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:11.800]   will prevent you from taking credit
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.380]   for what God has accomplished.
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.700]   It will also enable you to resist
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:20.380]   the ego-flattering suggestions
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:25.380]   that only you are the solution to a particular problem.
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:31.900]   My friends, you are not able to go it alone.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:35.900]   Talk to the person next to you.
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:40.900]   Tell them, you are not able to go it alone.
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.360]   As I ask our band to come back,
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:50.920]   our story has a happy ending.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:55.100]   Let's see it.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.500]   Verse 24.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:01.580]   Moses listened to his father-in-law
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:04.600]   and did everything he said.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.340]   Amen, let's stand up.
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:10.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:18.140]   What I wanna do now is to pray for us.
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:23.160]   We're just gonna have some music playing in the background.
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.940]   But this is really your time.
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.140]   As we prayed before the service,
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:32.780]   we had this picture of an ice cube that was melting
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:36.900]   and felt that really all of us need today
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:42.660]   to just allow God to melt away on the extremes for us.
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:46.740]   I'm gonna ask that God would give to you
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:52.500]   maybe a picture, a name of someone you need to be asked
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:56.480]   to be your Jephro, it may be more than one person.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:01.420]   Also that God would put in your mind
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:04.080]   people that you need to get alongside,
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.640]   you need to encourage.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:13.580]   Let's pray.
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:18.440]   Holy Spirit,
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:25.000]   we pray that you do a work in each one of our lives today.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.060]   We thank you for this story
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:33.460]   of how a father-in-law
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.480]   was used by you
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:40.560]   to change the life of Moses
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.980]   and by definition change the life of a relation.
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:49.800]   Come to me now,
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:54.760]   Lord, and start to show me
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.600]   maybe there are things in my life
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:03.200]   that I'm doing that I need to stop doing.
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:06.440]   (gentle music)
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:12.540]   Lord, help me to find a Jephro
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.460]   and help me, Lord, to be a Jephro
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:19.300]   to the next generation.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:24.020]   And as a church, Lord, we ask you
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:30.540]   that you would make us this church of cross generations
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.620]   (gentle music)
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:37.640]   Lord, how you would allow us.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.240]   We thank you, Lord, for the young people in this church,
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.240]   the sharp end, the energy,
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:49.240]   the desire to get things done.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:56.840]   Help us to be ones who would get around them,
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.100]   to empower them, to encourage them.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.720]   (gentle music)
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.560]   And if necessary, show them the way.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:08.560]   We thank you, Lord, for the many families
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.540]   you're raising up in this church,
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.180]   in some ways the backbone of the church.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:20.800]   I pray, Lord, you'd help us
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.100]   in this area of family priorities.
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:28.400]   So often in Hong Kong, Lord, we let business,
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:33.400]   we let church, we let things that we deem to be important
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.100]   get in the way of our families.
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:42.280]   And we pray, Lord, that you continue to raise up
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:49.960]   wise people, Lord, sometimes older, sometimes not,
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:53.880]   but people who can just give us direction in life.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:56.460]   (gentle music)
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:01.880]   So Holy Spirit, I just wait on you now.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:06.300]   Would you speak to me?
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:09.800]   Would you speak to us as a church?
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:14.360]   And actually, would you speak to us
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.960]   as a city here in Hong Kong?
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.980]   And would you raise up Moses's and Jethro's in this city?
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:36.840]   Thank you that your plan for us is cross-generational.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:43.000]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.140]   And the whole church said, amen.
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:47.920]   Thank you.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.500]   (gentle music)
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:56:00.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
