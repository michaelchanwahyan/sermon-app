[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Well, a couple of months ago, we held Alpha.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   And Alpha, as you know, is this incredible course
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.040]   that allows people to come together
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.480]   to really understand what it means
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.000]   and to know more about Jesus
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.120]   and to share the gospel with those around us.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.280]   And so we wanna hear an incredible story
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.840]   out of our last Alpha, where over 150 guests
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.280]   attended online in April.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.560]   So would you put a hand together for Pastor Jeff
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.880]   and Carl.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.320]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.280]   - Thank you, Carla.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.360]   Yes, I'm Jess, this is Carl.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.680]   So Alpha happened in April, so we had over 150 guests,
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560]   but we had over 60 volunteers.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.160]   60 of you joined Alpha as well.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.600]   And so we wanna tell you what that was like.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.080]   And Carl was one of those volunteers.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.080]   So tell us, what made you decide to serve on Alpha?
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.420]   - Yeah, well, nice to meet you all.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.680]   So I've been looking for an opportunity
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.600]   to help out at church.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.680]   So the Vine is my home church in Hong Kong,
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.840]   and it's really been a blessing to me.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.360]   The community, the broader community,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.840]   and friendships and the staff as well,
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.400]   and of course Sundays.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.480]   So I've been looking for a way to participate more
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.320]   and kind of root myself more deeply and to give back.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.560]   So I was familiar with Alpha
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.720]   mostly through my church in the UK.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.920]   And I've met a number of people
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.440]   who came to faith through Alpha.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.680]   And I sort of hear these stories,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.320]   and it makes me curious.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.320]   But I'm also sort of familiar but curious.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.720]   So I thought, why is Alpha so impactful for people?
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.200]   - So was your small group impactful?
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.280]   How was your small group?
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.120]   Tell us.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.960]   - Yeah.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.680]   My experience there was actually wonderful.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.200]   So I approached it very open,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.600]   kind of open to see what would happen,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.760]   and found that Alpha is indeed a fun, casual,
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.960]   and low-pressure environment for both guests and hosts.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640]   So I really like the idea of being able to share my faith
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.800]   and to not have to have all the answers,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.560]   despite being someone who works very hard to find answers.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.120]   And to not have to hold to a tight script
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.800]   or something like that.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.960]   As a helper and a group leader,
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.720]   I feel the best thing is to be open and to be prayerful
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.200]   and see what the Holy Spirit does in guests' lives.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.760]   - Yeah, so can you tell us anything
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.320]   that happened in your small group?
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.360]   - Sure, sure, of course.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.520]   So I can jump ahead and tell you about Annabelle.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.320]   And one of our guests in my group, Annabelle,
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.960]   gave us permission to share her story.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.760]   So Annabelle was born into a Christian family
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.920]   and was christened as a baby.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.640]   But she said she did not have a relationship with Jesus.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.120]   When she was 18, her father passed away from cancer,
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.280]   and before his death, he was in pain.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.760]   He was depressed, and he was so scared
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.760]   for his family's future,
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.640]   as Annabelle had an eight-year-old and a 10-year-old brother.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.360]   So this confirmed basically all her doubts
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.980]   about Christianity.
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.140]   She could not believe that a God
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.920]   could allow this kind of suffering.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.640]   Then about a year and a half ago,
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.680]   she was struggling with life in general,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.120]   and a friend invited her to the Vine
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.060]   where she heard about Alpha
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.920]   and how Alpha is an opportunity
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.140]   to explore the meaning of life.
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.980]   So she joined.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.560]   So this is how Annabelle described her experience.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.040]   She says, "I am quite introverted,
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.800]   "and sharing my thoughts, struggles,
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.880]   "and questions with friends can be a struggle,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.980]   "let alone with strangers.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.460]   "However, my group hosts were so welcoming and friendly,
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.760]   "and they made everyone feel at ease quickly.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.780]   "It was clear from the start that it was a safe space.
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.240]   "At first, I expected the host to give me answers
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.280]   "to my questions and to correct me
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.400]   "for my misunderstandings.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.480]   "But I soon realized that this was not the purpose
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.080]   "of a group host.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.840]   "They were there to guide our discussion,
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.260]   "to ensure everyone was heard,
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.380]   "and to keep us focused on the topic.
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.760]   "Listening to Nicky Gumbel,"
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.840]   we used Alpha videos, and Nicky Gumbel is the main speaker,
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.960]   "listening to Nicky Gumbel share his journey
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.800]   "was truly inspirational.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.620]   "And it's hard not to have faith in God
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.000]   "when you listen to what he and others have experienced."
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.600]   And personally, too, I was actually very touched
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.120]   by a lot of the testimonies that were shared.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.220]   Very powerful.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.580]   Back to Annabelle.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.980]   "I soon began to look forward to the meeting each week
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.980]   "and to hear more from my group members.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.400]   "The Alpha Day was the first time
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.480]   "that we all met in person.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.800]   "It was an amazing experience,
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.500]   "which culminated in a time of prayer
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.380]   "and asking to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.920]   "I now have a relationship with God,
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.040]   "but if I were to compare my relationship with God
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.240]   "to how I would write a child's report at school,"
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.380]   Annabelle is a teacher,
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.580]   "I would categorize their demonstration of a skill
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.060]   "as not yet developing or consisting,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.020]   "consistently, rather not yet, comma,
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.280]   "developing, comma, or consistently."
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.280]   I believe in Oxford commas, by the way.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.340]   [audience laughing]
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.180]   "I would say I am developing my relationship with God.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.540]   "I know that God hears me through prayer,
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.100]   "and I'm already starting to feel that I've been heard.
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.100]   "Through Alpha, I learned that there was more to life
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.380]   "than what I had been living,
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.140]   "and that God has a purpose for everyone, including me.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.140]   "I better understand why God allows people to suffer
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.880]   "and why bad things happen to good people.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.700]   "Having Jesus in my life has helped me
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.800]   "to widen my understanding of myself
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.620]   "and be more comfortable in my own skin.
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.260]   "It has led me to have a more positive outlook on life
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.020]   "and my life path.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.640]   "I find comfort in knowing that God's love is unconditional,
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.940]   "and he will forgive my sins
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.000]   "and help me to become a better person."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.060]   - Isn't that amazing?
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.500]   Isn't that a great story?
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.340]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.160]   [audience applauding]
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.360]   Alpha, we're starting Alpha again, 5th of October.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.920]   So we're launching the second Churchwide Alpha this year,
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.640]   and we would love you to all be involved.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.000]   And you can be involved in three ways.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.840]   So we can put on the best Alpha,
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.800]   but we need you to invite your friends.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.200]   So Alpha is aimed at people outside of the church.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.400]   So invite those who don't yet know Jesus
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.600]   to come and hear the good news about Jesus,
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.800]   just like Annabelle was invited.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.880]   So invite your friends, and here you'll find two QR codes.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.600]   The first one is the course signup.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.400]   That's something that you can send to your guests
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.800]   to sign up for Alpha.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.280]   But for you to be part of Alpha, there are three ways.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.680]   You can be like Carl,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.800]   come and be a small group hoster helper.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.640]   There's training.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.500]   The second thing is because this is happening online again,
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.800]   if you're familiar with Zoom,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.680]   we would love to borrow your tech capabilities.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.040]   Very important to come and help.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.840]   Or the Alpha Day, we heard about the Alpha Day.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.280]   This is the one day we have in person in here
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.880]   where we talk about the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.280]   You can volunteer in person on that day as well.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.160]   So yes, come and join,
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.920]   and let's share the love of Jesus with our city.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.760]   Does that sound good?
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.320]   - Yeah. - Great.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.160]   Thank you.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.000]   Thank you, Carl.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.520]   Let's give Carl a round of applause.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.840]   (audience applauding)
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.640]   - Thanks so much, Carl.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.480]   Carl's amazing.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.440]   I've gotten to know Carl quite well over the last few months,
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.600]   year or so, two years, three, I don't know, how long.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.000]   Long time, amazing man, get to know him.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.640]   Hey, everyone, how you doing?
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   Upper house.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.160]   You guys are all asleep, and I woke you up.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.040]   It's so great to be with you.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.800]   I tell you what, I tell you, my name's Andrew, by the way.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.680]   If you're new to the Vine, so great to have you here.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.400]   I'm one of the pastors.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.880]   I could not be more excited about the next number of weeks
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.020]   that are ahead of us here at the Vine.
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.340]   We're going to be starting a brand new sermon series
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.120]   next Sunday on Psalm 23.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.720]   Perhaps the most important, the most famous Psalm,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.920]   the most beloved Psalm that we have in the Scriptures.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.960]   And we're calling this series, "A Restful Presence,
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.680]   Psalm 23 for an Anxious World."
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.560]   And the reason why we're doing this,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.480]   and I'm gonna be teaching through the whole series.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.420]   We're gonna do about five weeks with each other.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.180]   We're gonna unpack every verse of that Psalm.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.400]   But the reason why we're doing it
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.880]   is because we believe that this Psalm
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.880]   is not just a personal call to find a place of rest in God,
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.720]   a personal call to have God as our shepherd
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.880]   and for us to know security,
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.600]   but actually Psalm 23 is about a discipleship.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.760]   It's about a way in which we are to live in the world.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.160]   In other words, Psalm 23 is not just a place
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.880]   for personal rest.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.920]   Psalm 23 is designed for us to be a restful presence
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.280]   planted in a chaotic world.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.280]   So when the world is freaking out,
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.980]   when the world is struggling with all the things
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.200]   that it's struggling with right now,
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.400]   when the world is trying to find its feet and get settled,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.560]   it looks to the church and it says,
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.480]   the church is suffering all the same things
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.860]   that we're suffering, but they're not freaking out.
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.700]   Why?
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.800]   That's what Psalm 23 is about.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.960]   It's about teaching the people of God
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.560]   how to find themselves a non-anxious presence
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.440]   in an anxious world.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.320]   And I wanna tell you this.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.660]   If you could get your head around that,
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.480]   if you could begin to wrestle with the idea
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.720]   that God can enable you to be at peace
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.720]   despite the craziness of this world,
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.040]   you will be incredibly attractive
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.480]   to those in your sphere of influence.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.040]   I can't tell you the number of times in my life
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.720]   where people have come up to me and said,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   people that don't know Jesus,
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.320]   why are you so at peace when things seem to be so crazy?
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.560]   And if you're anything like me,
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.780]   there's a lot of times in your life
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.940]   where you're also crazy,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.360]   where you're also overwhelmed.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.700]   Hands up if you're feeling a little stressed
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.000]   or anxious even right now.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.840]   You're all lying, okay?
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.580]   We do, don't we?
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.980]   We feel stressed, we feel anxious, we feel overwhelmed,
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.960]   but Psalm 23 is an invitation
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.000]   not just to find personal peace,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.280]   but to be that peace, to show the world.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.920]   And I can't tell you how more attractive it is
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.920]   for people to say, wow, I want to be like that
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.760]   and not like I currently am,
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.580]   freaking out all over the place.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.120]   So starting from next Sunday,
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.080]   I'm gonna unpack that over five weeks.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.840]   I cannot think of a better sermon series
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.200]   for you to invite your friends and family to than this.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.320]   Hands up if you have any stressed people
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.360]   in your friend group or family.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.560]   Right, invite them to church next week.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.960]   This will be a great opportunity
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.640]   for them to hear about that.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.800]   But today, before we get into Psalm 23 next week,
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.780]   I wanna do today a one-off message
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.440]   that I'm sort of seeing as a precursor,
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.500]   a prequel, if you will, to help prepare you
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.500]   as best as possible for Psalm 23 that's coming next week.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.460]   Because as I spent the last couple of months
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.140]   studying Psalm 23, and I've gone into quite a bit
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.220]   of research in detail about this Psalm,
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.620]   something struck me quite powerfully.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.100]   And as I dug deeper into the Psalm,
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.580]   I realized that there is some critical spiritual work
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.340]   that has to happen for all of us
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.800]   before we can begin to appreciate the power
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.780]   of what Psalm 23 is actually inviting us into.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.460]   In fact, if we don't do this important spiritual work first,
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.060]   we're gonna miss out on everything
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.840]   that I think God wants to share to us in that series.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.060]   The idea that before we can begin to think
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.340]   about what it is for God to be our shepherd,
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.900]   before we can begin to think about what it is
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.140]   for us to be led by quiet waters and into green pastures,
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.900]   before we can understand the power there is
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.820]   in being led through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.660]   of having a table laid before our enemies,
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.820]   of understanding that goodness and mercy will follow us
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.460]   for the rest of our lives, before we do any of that,
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:41.340]   we have to realize that there's an internal spiritual battle
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.700]   that is happening in every single one of us
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.260]   that is stopping us from receiving
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.460]   what Psalm 23 is all about.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.660]   And here's what that internal battle is.
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.900]   The opening of Psalm 23 says,
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.900]   "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want."
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.040]   The internal battle that we are all struggling with
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.700]   is that we wanna be the shepherd.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.980]   Think about it.
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.120]   That we wanna be the ones in control.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:17.000]   That we wanna be the ones that has it all worked out.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.640]   And so this is as simply as I could put it for today.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.820]   Before God can be our shepherd, we need to learn to be sheep
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.300]   because what is that metaphor?
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.140]   If we're declaring that God is our shepherd,
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.120]   we are ultimately saying we are his sheep.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.340]   We are his flock and we follow after him.
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.340]   The reality is, here's how Psalm 23 starts
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.200]   for the most of us.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.320]   I am the shepherd, where are my sheep?
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.360]   For I'll make you lay down in quiet orders.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.800]   We have this tendency as humans to take control,
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.740]   to take power.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.340]   And I think what we have to wrestle with deeply
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.220]   is why is this taking place inside of us
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.540]   and how come when it happens,
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.100]   although we think we're gonna find peace,
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.220]   ultimately all that ever results
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.460]   is more stress and anxiety for us.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:23.860]   Is God really your shepherd?
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:29.780]   Well, if you're anything like me,
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.580]   I think your response to that question might be sometimes.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.100]   I'm the pastor of a church.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.300]   So I can imagine for a lot of us sitting here
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.980]   for watching online right now,
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.740]   you're going, yeah, sometimes for me too.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.880]   There's another passage in scripture in the Psalms
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.180]   that's almost as famous as Psalm 23
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.200]   that is designed, I think,
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.720]   to help us prepare our hearts and our lives
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.900]   for all that Psalm 23 has.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.780]   And that Psalm is Psalm 46, verse 10.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.740]   And here's what it says.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.720]   Be still and know that I am God.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.140]   (sighs)
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.140]   Isn't that a wonderful word?
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.140]   Just be still and know that I am God.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.220]   Oh, we've heard that said so many times.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.740]   Isn't it like just welcoming you into like a fluffy cloud?
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.180]   Just chill out and have a vacation with God.
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.660]   It's time just to allow him to be God
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.920]   and just you to chill out.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.740]   This idea of being still and knowing that God is God
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.260]   is constantly spoken to us by fridge magnets
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.220]   around the world, by bumper stickers,
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.220]   by Instagram and Facebook posts.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.020]   And here's what you'll see
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.900]   kind of accompanying this idea of being still
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.220]   and knowing that God is God.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.780]   We will see the cheesiest,
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.660]   lowest form of art ever accompany this.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.380]   Like when people are trying to communicate to you
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.060]   what it is to be still and know that God is God,
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.900]   the Christians amongst us will try to provide
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.460]   the My Little Pony moments of art
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.700]   to make you try to feel like you're at peace, all right?
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.300]   I went on the interwebs this week
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.740]   and I pulled out four simple examples
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.540]   that I think are quite summative
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.420]   of all of the stuff you'll find on the interweb.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.260]   Are you ready?
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.100]   Here's the first one.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.060]   This is the first one.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.900]   It's the Scandinavian mountain view, right?
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.200]   Like if you wanna be still and know that God is God,
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.180]   go to Sweden, right?
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.740]   Like everybody in Sweden knows God, right?
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.320]   Like 'cause they stare at that all the time, right?
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.180]   So you have these kind of Scandinavian mountain view pictures.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.260]   Here's the second one.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.820]   This one I call the butterflies, yes.
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.740]   Like if we wanna be still and know that God is God,
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.820]   we must be hippies.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.540]   Ah, enjoying the beautiful stillness of blue light
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.340]   and shadows and butterflies.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.180]   Or how about this one?
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.180]   This one's pretty full on.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.680]   This one is the forest
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.260]   that's turned into a psychedelic picture.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.460]   This is like somebody was eating mushrooms in the forest
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.820]   and now they think that God is God.
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.420]   They're like so freaked out by the colors of the forest.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.420]   Are you with me?
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.180]   That suddenly they think that God is still
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.740]   and they know him or something like that.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.000]   Now here's my ultimate, ultimate, I can't stand it.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.840]   We all know it.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.460]   It's the cheesiest Christian symbol
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.020]   that there is on the internet.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.960]   It is the man and the woman
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.380]   that stand before the sunrise and go like this.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.820]   Yes, be still and know that I am God.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.240]   (sighs)
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.880]   Every single one of these horrible works of art,
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.540]   I shudder to even say that.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.100]   Every single one of these pieces of stuff
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.380]   is designed to try to sugar you into thinking
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.460]   what this text is all about.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.900]   That oh, just be still, just chill out,
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.140]   just enjoy the sunrise,
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.700]   get out there in nature a little bit more,
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.380]   see the beauty of the world,
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.740]   crawl up onto Jesus' lap
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.580]   and place your head on his heartbeat.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.140]   Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.980]   The reality is this picture that accompanies
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.580]   this idea of being still and knowing that God is God
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:09.660]   is about as far away from the original context
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.500]   of that passage that there can be.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.380]   In fact, if you read the broader context of Psalm 46,
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.140]   you'll be amazed that there aren't any my little ponies
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.580]   or butterflies or wonderful ideas of sunsets
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.620]   and people standing there like this.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.020]   Instead, the broader context of Psalm 46
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.980]   welcomes you into war, to fighting,
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.980]   to trauma, to turmoil,
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:39.740]   to the fact that humanity is trying to kill itself.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.020]   It's interesting, the wallpaper
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.340]   that should be accompanying this verse
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.980]   is people fighting each other.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.860]   Could you imagine throwing that onto your fridge?
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.300]   Fighting people, be still and know that I am God.
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.220]   Let me actually read to you the fullness
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.780]   of this passage in Psalm 46
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.100]   'cause I wanna unpack this a little bit together.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.660]   It's 11 verses, it's good to read scripture in church, amen?
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.220]   Are you ready?
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.180]   It says this, "God is our refuge and strength
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.020]   and ever present help in trouble."
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.540]   Notice that, trouble.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.620]   "Therefore we will not fear."
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.260]   Now notice this, "Though the earth give away,
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.500]   though the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.060]   though its waters roar and foam comes
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.700]   and the mountains quake with their surging."
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:24.220]   But there is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.900]   the holy place where the most high dwells.
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.340]   God is within her, she will not fall.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.220]   God will help her at the break of day.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.220]   But the reality is nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.660]   He lifts up his voice, the earth melts.
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.220]   But the Lord Almighty is with us.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.940]   The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.020]   Come and see the works of the Lord,
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.940]   the desolations he has brought on the earth.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.420]   For he makes wars that are happening all the time.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.880]   He is inferring here, he makes wars cease
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.940]   to the ends of the earth.
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.900]   He breaks the bow and shatters the spear.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.940]   Or in other words, he snaps the missiles
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.940]   and breaks down the guns.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.300]   He burns the chariots with fire.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.900]   He crushes the tanks.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.780]   He stops the bitter battle.
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:16.420]   Be still and know that I am God.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.580]   For I will be exalted amongst the nations.
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.340]   I will be exalted in the earth.
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.940]   The Lord Almighty is with us.
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.220]   The God of Jacob, our fortress.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.540]   Can you see that there's not a Scandinavian
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.380]   mountain view in sight?
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.780]   And what the Psalmist is trying to communicate here
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.660]   is the reality of the world in which we live.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.120]   He's not trying to make Christians get away
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.460]   from the reality that the world is a hard place.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.060]   And the imagery, let me show you this imagery again.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.380]   This idea of, he uses nature as imagery,
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.460]   that the earth give away,
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.580]   the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.380]   Though its waters roar and foam,
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.160]   the mountains quake with surging.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.700]   Later on, he speaks about nations in uproar,
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.140]   kingdoms falling.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.660]   This language in ancient Near Eastern poetic language
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.780]   and form is not actually speaking about the nature
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.620]   of the world.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.900]   It's actually a metaphor to speak about humanity
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.020]   by the what we're doing to one another.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.060]   It's a little bit like how the world is fighting each other
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.580]   and everything's falling down
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.640]   and all the horrible things are happening in nature.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.660]   That's what's happening in us.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.580]   That's what's happening between us.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.700]   We're battling and raging with one another.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.300]   We're trying to fight and be better than the other person.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.660]   Nations are in uproar about nations
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.340]   and all of this is taking place.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.980]   And it's not what God has originally intended,
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.660]   but it's the reality of this world.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.140]   And I think today, some sort of 3000 years later
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.700]   for when this verse was written,
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.200]   we come to think that that's still our world today.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.900]   This is not some butterflies and soft lighting.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.100]   This is the reality of what we're sitting in.
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.540]   In fact, I think if you were to write Psalm 46 today,
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.500]   here's some of the modern imagery and language
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.340]   we might use.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.100]   The nations are at war.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.080]   Governments are a mess.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.020]   People are no longer trusting the very people they used to.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.420]   We are posting hatred and hurt, fake news and lies
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.420]   and canceling each other left and right.
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.540]   Are you with me?
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.140]   Do you get the vibe here?
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.900]   This is what's happening in our time.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.900]   It's the same kind of expression
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.780]   that the Psalmist is trying to bring in his time.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.200]   And it's all designed to make the reader read the Psalm,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.740]   read the poem and ask a really critical question.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.480]   Why is this happening?
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.580]   I wonder if in the last couple of years,
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.180]   as you've seen this stuff take place,
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.580]   maybe you've asked yourself the same.
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.760]   Why is this always happening?
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.200]   Well, to answer that, we have to step back
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.580]   and look at the broader context of Israel
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.300]   in the Old Testament.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.980]   Because the Psalmist is writing this
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.860]   to the people of God in the Old Testament times,
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.420]   to Israel themselves, challenging them
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.760]   on the way in which they're acting.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.800]   And if you trace in biblical theology
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.940]   what Israel did in the Old Testament times,
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.800]   when they faced a catastrophe,
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.860]   when something went wrong for Israel,
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.860]   here's what you see throughout the Old Testament journey,
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.660]   time in and time again.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.780]   They would find themselves in a place
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.220]   of being out of control and in a panic,
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:17.140]   they would do whatever they could to get back into control.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.020]   So how they would do that very often
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.620]   in the pages of the Old Testament,
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.740]   is that they would think about some schemes
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.140]   that would enable them to feel like they're back in control.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.740]   So they would often try to strengthen their army
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.480]   in times that they felt insecure.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.920]   They would sometimes reach out to the nations around them
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.180]   and create political alliances.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.940]   Sometimes, oftentimes, they would push God to one side
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.840]   and begin to worship other gods,
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.580]   thinking, well, we're in a place
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.300]   where we've been worshipping Yahweh,
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.180]   it doesn't seem to be doing any good,
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.200]   we're out of control,
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.860]   well, let's just jettison what we really believe
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.140]   and let's start worshipping all these tribal gods
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.380]   in the hopes that someone, somewhere, it would stick
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.500]   and we would find peace again.
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.020]   It's fascinating to me that human nature,
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.380]   when things are difficult,
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:07.480]   even for the people of God, is to do this,
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:12.480]   to push God to one side and put ourselves in His place.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.380]   When we're overwhelmed, when we're anxious,
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.700]   when we feel like we're spinning out of control,
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:22.580]   very often what we do is we try to grasp a hold of control
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.260]   in our sphere of influence and our lives
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.860]   by placing ourselves in the center place,
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:32.580]   but by actually taking on the responsibility of providing
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.020]   and making things secure.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.580]   And so we reach out and we grasp a hold
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.580]   of the other things around our lives
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.620]   that we think are gonna bring us stability
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.820]   and push God out of that picture.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.500]   Are you tracking with this so far?
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.860]   Now, here's why this is important to you,
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.340]   because if you go right back in biblical theology
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.340]   to the beginning of sin in Genesis 3,
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.700]   what is it that you see there?
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.260]   What is the original temptation that Satan brings humanity?
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.300]   He shows up and he says, "You need to eat
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.540]   "of that one fruit that God told you not to eat from,
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.740]   "the fruit of the knowledge of God and evil.
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.460]   "And the reason why you need to eat that
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.220]   "is because when you eat it," guess what?
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.060]   "You'll become like God.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.220]   "You won't be his image anymore.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.900]   "You'll actually be like him.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.900]   "You'll be your own God."
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.900]   That was the original temptation in the garden.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.900]   That is the underlying temptation of all sin,
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.900]   that we push God to one side and we become God's ourselves.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.460]   And if you think about the reality of the last three years
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.220]   here in Hong Kong, and you think about all the turmoil
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.060]   that we've gone through,
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.060]   all the things that we've struggled with,
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.620]   it's been so easy for us to push God to one side and go,
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.780]   "I need to find stability and control.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.340]   "So I'm gonna work harder.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.700]   "I'm gonna earn more money.
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.180]   "I'm gonna do the things that I know to do
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.420]   "to create some sense of control
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.860]   "in my ever spinning out of control life."
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.440]   It's very easy for us to become the shepherd.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.100]   Are you with me?
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.420]   And we do it because we're trying to find control
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.100]   in a life that's quickly spinning out of control.
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.420]   Let me just say this to you.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.540]   You cannot control everything.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:22.180]   You were not designed to be God.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.720]   You were designed to be his image.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.100]   And God's placed his character and his love and his power
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.220]   and his mercy and his grace and his wonder in you.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.040]   And it's an amazing thing,
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.660]   but you were not created to carry the weight
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.700]   that God carries, to carry the struggle
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.860]   that he holds in his heart and his hands.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.100]   You were not designed to take all of the struggle
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.020]   and the trouble of life on your shoulders.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.860]   You were not designed to be exhausted
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.860]   because you're trying to provide for yourself
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.220]   and find stability and you push God to one side.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.600]   That was not how you were created to be.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:01.140]   And we sit here wondering why we're exhausted.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.960]   It's 'cause we're playing God.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.320]   Here's a reality that if you can get your head around this,
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:13.080]   really understand this, this will completely set you free.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:19.220]   When we drive ourselves constantly to find control
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.360]   in an ever-changing world,
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.340]   we will only ever be more and more out of control.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.920]   Come on, church.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.660]   If you constantly are striving
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.020]   to find control in your life,
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.420]   and if you're the one who's putting that pressure
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.720]   on yourself to find that control, find the answers,
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.480]   find things settling down through your own strength,
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.280]   you will only find yourself more and more at war
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.420]   to use the imagery of Psalm 46.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.260]   Why?
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.640]   Because when you place yourself in the center of your world
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.640]   and you push God to one side,
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.900]   when you try to provide for yourself
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.800]   where God should be providing for you,
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.240]   when you try to find security for yourself,
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.200]   when God can only be that security,
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.760]   here's what you will do.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.500]   You will provide for yourself at the expense of the other.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.000]   You will do all that you can yourself
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.600]   at the expense of another.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.000]   In other words, you will be at enmity
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.280]   with the people around you,
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.240]   because if they can't help you, you will pull them down.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.260]   You will do everything you can to protect me, myself, and I.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.920]   And what happens when we do that
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.880]   is we actually end up in more stress,
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.720]   more anxiousness, more fear.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.640]   We actually feel more overwhelmed,
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.040]   which ironically causes us to hold on tighter even more
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.440]   to the reality that we are God.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.440]   Now, this is a cycle that Psalm 46
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.320]   is trying to communicate to us.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.160]   And let me show you this.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.680]   I call this the being God cycle.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.520]   Here it is.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.440]   So there's being God.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.960]   Now, how that starts is we try to grasp a hold,
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.360]   hold on and grasp a hold of the things in our lives.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.720]   And that grasping together,
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.980]   that kind of grasping of control
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.740]   is the very thing that we think is gonna set us free,
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.960]   but actually all it does is creates more fear,
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.200]   more turmoil, more trouble, and more war.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.880]   And because we're now in a place
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.480]   where we're actually more overwhelmed
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.600]   than we were to start with, guess what we do?
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.440]   We try to grasp on control even more,
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.360]   which then sets us off in a place of turmoil,
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.360]   war, and strife again.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.000]   And suddenly there's a cycle
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.560]   that's taking place in our lives,
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.720]   and we're wondering why we're exhausted.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.000]   We're wondering why here in Hong Kong
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.080]   we're running on a treadmill.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.600]   We're wondering why it is
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.960]   that we're constantly stressed and overwhelmed
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.520]   and wondering why we don't have stability in our lives.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.280]   It's because we're being God.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:55.520]   And the question is, is there another way to live?
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.120]   Enter Psalm 46, verse 10.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.320]   "Be still and know that I am God."
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.280]   There's no Scandinavian mountaintop here.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.040]   There is a command of God.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.720]   This is the only time in the whole Psalm
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.640]   where God speaks in the first person.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.440]   This is a command of God to a stressed-out humanity
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.960]   that is playing God.
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.800]   And he says, "Be still."
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.940]   There is another way to live.
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:35.220]   The Hebrew word for "be still" here is the word rafa.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.480]   You have to roll your R when you say it, rafa.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.140]   It sounds like, I don't know, the Lion King or something.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:40.980]   Rafa.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.220]   Rafa means this.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.020]   It means to cease.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.700]   It means to stop.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.380]   It means to stop striving, cease striving.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.860]   It means to release.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.140]   It means to actually become weak.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:00.140]   It means to basically give up the idea that we are God.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.180]   In fact, in the poetic language of the ancient Near East,
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.820]   when rafa is used, it's often referred to in a metaphor
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.460]   as the place of the dead.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.760]   When it's used in this scripture in this point,
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.760]   it's actually speaking of dying to self, dying to yourself.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.800]   So far from the butterflies, my ponies,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.300]   and the Scandinavian villages,
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.500]   what God is doing is coming to a stressed-out humanity
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.340]   who are putting themselves as God and has shoved Him aside.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.100]   And He's saying, "Stop it.
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.220]   Stop your ridiculous activity.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.020]   Stop the ridiculous propensity that you have
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.380]   to try to be God.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.780]   You can't be God.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.420]   And if you try to be God,
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.500]   you're just gonna be stressed out, overwhelmed.
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.780]   The cycle's gonna continue.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.020]   Just stop it."
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.100]   Do you feel it?
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.300]   Do you feel His passion for you?
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.220]   He's standing over you, not telling you off,
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.980]   but inviting you to a different way
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.220]   where He becomes central in everything.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.900]   He's saying, "Cease this activity right here, right now.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.780]   Stop being God," which is why when He says, "Be still,"
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.300]   rafa in the Hebrew, it's immediately followed by,
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.460]   "And know that I am God."
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.540]   Notice that.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:12.580]   Sometimes when we read this verse,
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.620]   we think it's, "Be still and know that I am God."
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.180]   In the Hebrew, the emphasis is this,
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:22.020]   "Be still and know that I am God."
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.700]   Not you, not you.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.620]   I haven't created you to be that way.
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.300]   And you've got all this stuff on your shoulders
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.820]   and you're trying to carry so much
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.860]   and you're trying to be the answer for all your family
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.020]   and all your kids and you're trying to work it all out
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.900]   and you're trying to have all your eyes dotted
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.100]   and all your teeth crossed
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.580]   and all you're doing is getting more stressed,
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.540]   more overwhelmed, more fed up, more angry, more bitter.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.500]   And you're beginning to not like the people around you
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.700]   in your life and there's burnout after burnout.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.700]   Stop and allow me to be what I am.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:56.380]   I am and you be what you are.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.540]   Let go.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:07.020]   Stop grasping and allow me to be God.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:13.060]   This idea of stopping grasping is quite personal for me.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.380]   Over the last two years of COVID,
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.380]   I've been working out as you can tell.
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.060]   And you shouldn't laugh that much.
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.300]   That's a little offensive.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.420]   But I have a gym at home.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.980]   I set up a home gym because I knew the gyms would close
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.500]   and stuff and I wanted to continue to work out.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.580]   So I set up a home gym
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.940]   and I've been working with a personal trainer.
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.620]   And you know those memes where like,
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.420]   you look at the gym mirror and you're like a buff person
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.420]   and then you look at your home mirror
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.580]   and you're flabby, right?
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.900]   We have this propensity when we're in the gym
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.460]   to think we're way bigger and better and greater
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.900]   than we actually are in real life.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.700]   And about two months ago,
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.500]   I've been pushing my dumbbells a lot
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.900]   and really kind of working on that.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.580]   And I was getting a pain happening down my arm.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.780]   And I said to my personal trainer one week,
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.420]   I said, "I know why I'm getting this pain.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.460]   I've got this pain in my arm.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.580]   I'm getting it because I'm trying to lift too heavy.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.980]   I pump so well.
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.580]   I'm so good at doing dumbbell."
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.420]   You know, like I was speaking myself up,
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.580]   feeling great about the incredibly heavy weight
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.060]   that I was lifting.
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.620]   And he was like, "Where's your pain?"
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.580]   And I'm like, "Oh, it's like shoots up
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:16.420]   like just right here."
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.660]   And he sort of looks at my arm and he sort of stands back.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.700]   He's like, "Hmm."
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.140]   He goes, "Andrew, I don't think your problem
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.020]   is actually the weight that you're trying to lift.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:26.980]   Because I think the problem is
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.940]   you're gripping the barbell too hard."
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.460]   And then he said this to me.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.780]   He said, "You'd be able to lift a lot more
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:35.860]   if you just let go."
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:42.500]   God comes to a stressed out humanity in Psalm 46.
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.340]   And he says, "Guess what?
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.700]   It's counterintuitive, but it's awesome 'cause it's me.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.140]   You would be able to carry a lot more
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.620]   if you just let go."
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.820]   See, some of you are crushing under a weight
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.460]   that actually you can carry.
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.820]   But you're crushed under that weight.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.020]   It's a weight that God has given you,
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.540]   but you're crushed under it
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.020]   because you're trying to be God in it.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.860]   You're trying to make the answers happen.
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.820]   You're trying to take control.
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.460]   And so the weight's crushing you, but guess what?
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.860]   You can lift, you can carry.
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.220]   You can carry the very weight
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.740]   that God has placed upon your life
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:20.860]   if you simply let grow of the grasping.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.700]   If you let God be God again,
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.980]   if you let Him hold the weight for you,
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.340]   if you let Him be the one who is in control.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:34.260]   He says, "Be still and know that I am God,
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.220]   that I'm the one at work here.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.900]   I'm the shepherd.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.740]   And when I'm the shepherd, you are not at once."
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:42.980]   But the problem is,
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:48.620]   the problem is we are so often in God's place.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.820]   Now, I want you to hear something
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.340]   really, really, really carefully here.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.940]   I am not saying let go of your responsibilities.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:01.100]   I am not saying let go of the God-given gifts
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.220]   that God has given you,
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.860]   the stewardship of resources
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.540]   that He's put around your life,
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.380]   the wonderful talents and gifts and inspiration
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.580]   you have, He's not saying let go of your dreams.
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.300]   He's saying, "Let go of carrying the very things
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.020]   that I have not called you to carry.
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.420]   Let go of trying to control the things
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.980]   that only I can control.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.780]   Let go of trying to control the things
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.180]   that you were not designed or created to control."
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.100]   Those are the things.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.700]   He's not saying it's time to quit.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.260]   He's not saying it's time to give up.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.820]   He's not saying it's time to just wait on God
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:31.660]   to do everything.
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.660]   He's given you gifts, He's given you talents,
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.740]   He's given you a mind, He wants you to use it.
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.100]   He's just giving you a gift.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.220]   He wants you to use it.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.500]   He's just saying, "Stop being God.
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.020]   Stop being in the center of it all
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.140]   and recognize that only I can be God.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.340]   And when I'm God, Jesus would say this in the scriptures,
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.980]   "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.180]   and I will give you rest and peace,
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.540]   and I'll carry the load
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.820]   because then I'm in the rightful place."
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:02.100]   And some of us are so overwhelmed right now
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.940]   'cause we've forgotten to be still.
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.420]   It's a big challenge for us
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:16.540]   to replace ourselves in relationship with God.
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.660]   Like Emma said in the song earlier,
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.780]   to really understand God as our friend,
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.140]   to really know that He is our Lord and Savior
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.820]   and friend to us.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.860]   It's so difficult for us to make that happen.
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:35.340]   But the benefits of putting Him in that place
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.580]   are incredible.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.540]   I wanna show you what Psalm 46 shows us here
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.020]   as some of the benefits of knowing who God is.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.300]   It says, "God is our refuge and strength
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.900]   whenever we're present in trouble.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.020]   We will not fear, though the earth give away.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.380]   He is with us.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.300]   He is for us."
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:55.420]   It says here that He is like a fortress to us.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.980]   It says, "There are rivers that make streams glad
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:58.820]   in the city of God."
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.220]   God is, we see Him now as this new river
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.460]   that He's with us on.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.780]   There's all this stuff that's at work in the city
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.420]   at work in us that says that He is our provider.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.740]   He is the one who looks after us.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:09.700]   He is the one who...
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.220]   And it all happens 'cause we are to let go.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.980]   So the antidote that Psalm 46 is bringing us to,
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.540]   opposed from being God,
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.980]   there's this other way of living.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.420]   It's being still.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.180]   And being still also creates this incredible cycle
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.020]   in our lives.
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:27.860]   Let me show you.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.460]   So being still, it's about letting go.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.980]   And as we let go of those things
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.620]   that we're grasping tightly on, guess what happens?
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.860]   We get to know who God is.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.860]   We get to encounter Him.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.700]   Why?
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.180]   Because we've stepped out of that place.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.860]   We've put God in the place.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.220]   It's really hard to know God when you're God.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.980]   It's really hard to know God
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.860]   when you yourself are trying to be God.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.340]   But as you be still, you let go,
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.060]   you put God in the right place, He becomes God again.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:55.900]   And guess what?
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.460]   You then get to know His trust, His security, His help.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.780]   And guess what that does?
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.780]   That enables you then to let go of even more stuff.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.660]   'Cause you recognize that He's actually at work.
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.060]   He is actually holding you up.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.500]   He is fighting battles for you.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.700]   So you continue to let go and continue to let go.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.700]   And a new cycle is recreated.
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.540]   And Psalm 46 is inviting us into that way of life.
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.900]   Let me put both of them together.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.140]   And you can take a photo of this if you want,
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.420]   if that's your jazz and thing.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.540]   Here's the thing on the left.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.220]   That's what we primarily do in life, I think.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.420]   We are God and we're stressed out.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.500]   And there's this horrible cycle of grasping to one,
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.340]   fear and turmoil.
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:36.220]   But Psalm 46 10 says, "Let it go, release the grasp,
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:41.220]   live a different way, be still and know that I am God."
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:45.060]   (sighs)
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.020]   That's a good thing.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.740]   It's not quite Scandinavian mountaintops.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.060]   It's so, so much better than that.
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:57.060]   It is being released into the fullness of who God is
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.420]   and putting him in the rightful place in our lives.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.700]   I think if God was to rewrite Psalm 46 verse 10,
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.140]   he would say this.
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:10.300]   He would say, "Your ability to truly know me as God
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.060]   is directly related to your ability
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.220]   to let go of pretending to be God."
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.740]   Make sense?
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.740]   Your ability to truly know me as God
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.340]   is directly related to your ability
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.300]   to let go of pretending to be God.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:29.060]   And as you let that go, loosen your grasp,
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.220]   you'll find yourself lifting more weight.
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.740]   There's one and only one other place
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.260]   in the whole of the Bible
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.220]   where this phrase, "Be still," is actually found.
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.300]   And I wanna read this to you as I close.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:47.620]   This is found in Mark chapter four, verse 35.
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.340]   It says this, "That day when even came,
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.380]   he said to the disciples,
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.740]   'Let us go over to the other side.'
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.620]   Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.180]   just as he was in the boat.
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.220]   There were also other boats with him.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:03.460]   A furious squall, a great big storm came up,
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.260]   and the waves broke over the boat
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.100]   so that it was nearly swamped.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.860]   Jesus was in the stern sleeping on a cushion.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.700]   The disciples, though, were frantically panicking
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.780]   and running around and trying to sort it all out."
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.980]   The disciples were trying to sort out the storm,
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.900]   try to stay alive, trying to work out
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.040]   how they can harness the wind,
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.660]   how they can keep the boat afloat.
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:25.620]   And they're so freaked out that they wake up Jesus
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.420]   and they say, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.620]   So Jesus got up, he rebukes the wind,
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.740]   and says to the waves, "Quiet, be still."
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.500]   Rafa.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.220]   It's the same word with the same emphasis
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.700]   and the same passion.
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.060]   He speaks to the storm and he says, "Storm, be still."
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.020]   And it says, "Immediately, the wind died down
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.540]   and was completely calm."
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.260]   This is a beautiful metaphor of the reality
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:52.580]   of what our human life is like.
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.380]   We're in this boat and storms come against us
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.340]   and up and around us.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.860]   And we do our best to try to control the storm,
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:40:59.740]   try to work it out.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.620]   And as the storm overwhelms us,
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.960]   the disciples do the right thing.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.660]   They turn to Jesus and they say, "We cannot do this.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.780]   We are not God.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.940]   We are not equipped for it."
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.820]   And Jesus stands up and he says to the raging storm,
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.020]   "Be still."
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.180]   And it dies down and everything changes.
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:21.420]   But what we have to understand is that in Psalm 46,
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.620]   it's the same word, but slightly different usage.
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.820]   In Psalm 46, the storm is not out there
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.420]   in the world somewhere.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.900]   And we're asking Jesus to calm that storm.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.220]   In Psalm 46, we're the storm.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.980]   We're the ones out of control.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.260]   We're the wind that's trying to fight
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.820]   against the elements of this world.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.260]   We are God.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:51.020]   And Jesus rebukes us.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.460]   Be still.
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.900]   Cease your activity.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.900]   You can't grasp on hard enough.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.540]   So have the courage to let go.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.860]   As we start Psalm 23 next week,
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:10.220]   the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.580]   I have no ones.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:15.300]   The question you have to ask yourself today is,
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.180]   is that true for you?
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.740]   Can we pray?
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.380]   Let's pray.
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:28.020]   Father, we come before you now as your people.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.740]   We come before you knowing this story,
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:36.700]   the raging storm that is found inside of us.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:41.300]   We come to you understanding our propensity
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.980]   to try to control our lives.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:48.420]   We come to you understanding that we have the tendency
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.340]   to take control of the things that are out of control.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:55.260]   That we try to control the things
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.900]   that we weren't actually even designed to control.
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:03.580]   We try to do everything we can to make our future perfect,
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:07.340]   when in reality we cannot even begin to impact
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:10.340]   or shape what it is that's gonna happen next.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:16.420]   Father, I wanna pray today for those
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.380]   where this message is really important.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.500]   (gentle music)
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.340]   Lord, for those of us who are sitting here today
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:25.860]   and we know the being God cycle,
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:30.460]   where we know we're at war with ourselves
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:31.660]   and others around us,
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.620]   where we know that we've been trying to get control
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.900]   of an uncontrollable situation
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.860]   so much that it's stressing us out
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.700]   and we're grasping a hold of it.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:47.300]   Father, I wanna pray today for those that recognize
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:51.500]   that Jesus is commanding their storm to be still today.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.860]   And whether you're online or in this room right now,
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.020]   just whilst our eyes are closed,
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.980]   in a moment I'm gonna invite you if this is for you.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.180]   It won't be for everybody perhaps,
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.020]   but if this is speaking to you today,
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.660]   if you know that that command of being still
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.180]   is needed in your life today,
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.980]   in a moment I'm gonna invite you to stand
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.860]   whether you're online or in this room,
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.940]   you can stand if you're online.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.060]   I wanna invite you to stand and to do so,
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.380]   it's a prophetic act because this is about the courage
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.300]   to let go,
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.020]   the courage to say, I've had enough,
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:31.260]   the courage to say, I've tried to be God
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.660]   and I'm exhausted and overwhelmed
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.020]   and I need to be still again.
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:42.380]   And so for us in this room, for those online right now,
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.740]   if you would like me to pray for you
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.380]   about that specific thing,
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.500]   if this is something that's working in your heart right now,
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.420]   I wanna invite you just, we're not gonna look around,
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.700]   I'm just gonna invite you to stand,
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.060]   you're standing in faith right now.
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.620]   And you standing as a way of saying,
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.260]   this is for me right here in this moment,
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.980]   I need to let go.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.220]   There's a part of my life where I'm holding on
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.900]   and it's too much and it's overwhelming me
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.940]   and I need to let go.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.980]   Holy Spirit, would you come now
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.420]   for everybody online and in this room in this moment
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.980]   who are standing before you.
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.300]   If you're standing, I just wanna encourage you
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.460]   to open your hands.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:22.620]   And there's a storm that's raging around inside of you.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.980]   You're living in an uncontrollable world.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.460]   You can't control everything.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:34.540]   But the good news is God doesn't expect you
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.900]   to control everything.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.220]   He doesn't ask you to control everything
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.300]   and letting go of control is freaky for many of us.
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.940]   If you're a control freak like me,
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.260]   this is a word and season.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.380]   It's hard to let go.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:53.820]   But as you hold on, you will know God less.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:58.980]   And God's heart towards you today is I want you to know me.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.180]   I want you to know my trust and my security
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.460]   and my provision and my power.
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:06.820]   I want you to truly understand who I am.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:11.820]   Would you Rafa, would you cease the striving
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:15.540]   and know that I am your God?
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:20.900]   Father, I pray for a release right now
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.500]   by the power of your spirit
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.620]   of every person standing before you.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:30.240]   Father, they're standing with that honesty of saying,
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.740]   I'm sorry, Lord.
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:36.740]   And although there's no condemnation,
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:43.420]   this phrase far from that cheesy picture
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.220]   we put around it is a command.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.540]   It's a strong word to us.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.740]   Father, as we learn what it is to put you
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.840]   in the rightful place again in our hearts.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.020]   Father, I know that all the benefits are coming.
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:02.100]   Lord, I know the peace and the beauty and the security
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.300]   and the hope and the love
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.700]   and the reconciliation of relationships
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.020]   and the things that the Holy Spirit wants to do.
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:09.940]   It is yours.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.080]   God has got so much goodness.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.820]   When you put him as first in your life,
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.900]   there's such an abundance of his care.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.940]   So Lord, come.
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:28.960]   Take a moment just to receive his glory,
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.300]   to be in awe of his goodness.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:37.220]   Him in the rightful place is the place of shalom.
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:40.720]   It's what the scriptures cry out for constantly.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.060]   (gentle music)
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.260]   And wouldn't it be amazing
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.940]   if we could be a restful presence in an anxious world?
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:53.580]   If we could be the very ones that people turn to
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:57.060]   and say, "How do you have such peace?"
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:02.900]   And you reply, "It's not 'cause I got all the answers.
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.260]   It's not 'cause my bank account's secure.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:08.420]   It's not because everything's perfect in my life.
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.220]   It's because I realize I'm not God."
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.360]   And I have a God.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.760]   I have a shepherd.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.260]   And I have this one that I get to follow for my whole life.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.720]   And it is so good.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:24.160]   Would you come on Alpha?
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:29.560]   Would you come and taste and know that this Lord is good?
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:34.020]   I just wanna pray for you just to continue to receive.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.000]   We're gonna go into a time
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.900]   of just receiving from him in worship.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.700]   I know we've gone a little bit longer,
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.340]   but I don't want you to rush out of this moment.
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:45.140]   You don't need to rush at the end of this service.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.040]   Lunch can wait.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.820]   This is important work.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.440]   It's important spiritual work for you today.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.860]   Just allow the Holy Spirit to do that
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.060]   as we worship over you,
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:01.500]   as you allow the Spirit of God to worship over you.
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:05.120]   Find him again in that beautiful place of him as your Lord.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.700]   (gentle music)
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.280]   (gentle music)
