1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
 So there's a sound, a sound that you are familiar with more than any other.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:15,680
 When you hear it, your whole being responds and reacts, shifting towards it, suddenly

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,400
 conscious of nothing else.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,200
 By this sound, you have been shaped.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:30,780
 You have been identified, at one and the same time, as very common and yet beautifully unique.

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,660
 This sound travels with you, it goes before you, it follows after you.

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:46,200
 When the sound is loud, it can summon up all anger, hatred, revenge, joy.

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:55,280
 And that sound is soft, it invites compassion, seduction, intimacy, love.

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,160
 It is a sound that both creates and also corrects.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,080
 And if I was to make this sound right now, it would fill you with a sense of dignity

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,040
 and honor not possible in any other way.

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,400
 What is this sound?

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,200
 It is your name.

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,840
 And the day when my wife and I named our daughter is perhaps one of the most special days of

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
 my life.

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,900
 If you've been here at the Vine for a while, you'll know that my wife and I were not able

17
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,760
 to have our own biological children.

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,040
 And so we have built our family through the wonder of adoption.

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,320
 And I remember adoption being a difficult journey with some beautiful moments in it.

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,200
 One of the interesting things about adoption is that you often with adoption don't meet

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,400
 the child on the first day that they're born.

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,440
 Often that will happen later.

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,640
 My wife and I were matched to our daughter when she was 16 months old.

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,160
 The photo that's coming up here behind me now was taken...

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,520
 I know, I just wanted to put a photo of my daughter.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,840
 I shaped the whole message around that photo right there.

27
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,760
 I took this photo just 15 minutes after meeting her for the very first time.

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,320
 Can you imagine?

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,840
 Heart-melt moment, right?

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,760
 Now here's the interesting thing.

31
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,000
 Our daughter, understandably, came with a name.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,840
 I mean, she was 16 months old, wasn't she?

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,000
 And so she had been given a name from her biological mother.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And so in the first two sessions when we spent time with our daughter, we used the name,

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,800
 of course, that she had been given.

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,640
 But my wife and I, we had said during the adoption process, long before we got matched,

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,760
 that we wanted the honor of naming our child.

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,440
 Because most other families, when they give birth biologically, have that honor of doing

39
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
 that.

40
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,440
 And we didn't want that honor necessarily taken away from us, because there's power

41
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,400
 in naming something.

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,080
 That naming something carries with it a story and a journey and speaks of something.

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,680
 And so we wanted to do this.

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,400
 And so we had a list of names, just like every normal family.

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,760
 A list of names.

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,360
 Some were good, some were really bad, but there was a list of names.

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,760
 And we decided that we were gonna spend a couple of times meeting with our daughter

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,400
 before deciding which name was suitable, because we wanted to name her in a way that would

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,520
 capture her character, capture something about her.

50
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,120
 Because that's what names do, don't they?

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,400
 They shape and tell you something about that person, who they are, maybe something that

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
 labels them in a certain way.

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,880
 And so we spent a couple of sessions just hanging out with her, getting to know her,

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,120
 discovering her personality.

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,720
 And soon after that, about a week after meeting her, when I took this photo for the first

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,400
 time, we named her Mia Lynn Gardner.

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,720
 Mia is Latin for "mine."

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,880
 This was like my wife and I going, "Back off, every human being in the world.

59
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,960
 This one is mine.

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
 This one is ours.

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,000
 We're taking this one into our family.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,120
 No one else is ever gonna have this one.

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,660
 This is her forever family."

64
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,440
 But we also knew that this was an important name for her too, for every time she says

65
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,080
 her name from that moment onwards, she's also declaring, "These parents are mine.

66
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,320
 No one can take them away from me either.

67
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,840
 They are mine.

68
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,960
 They're a part of my forever family.

69
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,760
 So she is Mia, mine."

70
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:40,000
 Lynn is my wife's mother's name.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,560
 And it's a beautiful name.

72
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,720
 And we decided that when we were naming Mia, that we had to name her along her New Zealand

73
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,920
 family, not just her British family.

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,300
 We knew that she would have the last name Gardner, my name as the British family line.

75
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,840
 But we also decided that she needed to carry her New Zealand family name.

76
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,720
 That's important, the whanau in New Zealand.

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,000
 That's the Maori name for family.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,320
 We wanted her to represent her whanau in New Zealand.

79
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,920
 So Lynn was the gateway for that, saying that Mia has connected to the land of the long

80
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,100
 white cloud, that's New Zealand, and she's connected to the UK through me.

81
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,360
 And that name was important because there's power in a name.

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,920
 And now anytime that my daughter ever says that name, anytime I ever write it on a piece

83
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:31,220
 of paper, I'm declaring to the world that her story changed on that day.

84
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,960
 And her story is a beautiful one about to be written.

85
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,200
 She is mine.

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,300
 She's connected.

87
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,780
 She has a family.

88
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,240
 It is glorious.

89
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,440
 Now the Bible, the Bible often talks about the power of a name.

90
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,760
 In fact, sometimes I think God spends most of his time in the Bible naming things.

91
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,040
 I don't know if you've ever noticed this.

92
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,360
 If you've been coming to the Vine for a while and listening to my preaching, you'll know

93
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,640
 that so often I'll pause when I'm explaining a passage and I'll tell you about the name

94
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
 of somebody.

95
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,200
 I'll explain to you what that name means of a person or of the village that the disciples

96
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
 are in.

97
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,360
 Because more often than not, the Bible writers are including those names because in the name

98
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,960
 there is something captured that will tell you about that message, tell you about what

99
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,760
 God is actually trying to say and do in that moment.

100
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,440
 I don't know if you've noticed this in the Bible either, but God has this tendency of

101
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,880
 changing people's names, of going, "Oh, you're this.

102
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
 No, you're not that.

103
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,220
 You're actually this."

104
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:39,640
 So we have God creating the very first human being and he says, "This is Adam," from the

105
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,120
 Hebrew word Adama.

106
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,940
 Adama meaning soil or dirt.

107
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,080
 And it was God's way of going, "Watch what God can do, that I can take the very soil

108
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,600
 and dirt of creation and create the most wonderful thing, this thing called humanity."

109
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:04,000
 Jacob, which means son of laughter, his name is changed to Israel, which means to suffer.

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,760
 And if I was him, I would rather have had the first name.

111
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,120
 But God names him Israel because to suffer would be what would shape and face Israel

112
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,440
 as this nation's history.

113
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,280
 You could argue even to this day, and yet God who walks with a group of people who are

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,840
 in pain and can show them his grace and his mercy.

115
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,160
 And if there's ever a nation that has shown the wonder and the miracle and the mercy of

116
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,320
 God, surely it's Israel.

117
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,980
 Simon, Simon who has this moment, a fisherman for many years, has this moment of clarity

118
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,600
 when Jesus says, "Who do you think I am?"

119
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,360
 And he says, "You're the Messiah, the son of God, right?"

120
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,320
 Jesus says, "I'm no longer going to call you Simon anymore, but your name is Peter,

121
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,600
 because Peter means rock.

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 And from this point on, I'm going to build my church.

123
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,360
 I'm going to build the people that will always gather under my name, under the foundation

124
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,960
 of the revelation of the understanding that I am the Messiah.

125
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,400
 Oh, you're now Peter, the rock."

126
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,920
 God loves to change our names because a little bit like with Chris and I, in that moment

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,880
 of adoption, where we were honoring the name that she had been given, of course, by her

128
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,680
 biological mom, but we wanted to put an imprint on her to say that this is now her story.

129
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,120
 So God names us.

130
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,920
 And when he names us, it's like he's declaring over us our character, who we are, what it

131
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,360
 is that he sees in us.

132
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,280
 It is both a declaration of his ownership, but it is also an invitation into the prophetic

133
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,520
 life that we're going to live in him.

134
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:44,960
 And there is one name, one name that we should all long for him to call us.

135
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,280
 To understand what that name is, we have to understand the trajectory of human history.

136
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,880
 My staff are going to roll their eyes right now, because I'm going to talk about Genesis

137
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,320
 1 and 2, and I do that a lot.

138
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:04,400
 But in Genesis 1 and 2, God creates humanity, male, female, brings them together, and God

139
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,720
 reveals his intimacy to Adam and Eve.

140
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,560
 And God names them, claims them, and draws them to his family.

141
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,040
 And you see this wonderful picture of intimacy in Genesis 1 and 2.

142
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,920
 We're told that they walk together, the three of them, in this intimate family unit together

143
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,600
 in the cornice of the night in the garden itself.

144
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,920
 It is a wonderful picture of what the Bible describes as shalom, this word peace, which

145
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,440
 just basically means the wholeness of creation, the way things were always intended to be.

146
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,800
 This was before sin.

147
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,400
 This was before brokenness.

148
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,160
 This was the way that God had created his relationship with humanity to be.

149
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,200
 It's shalom, it's peace.

150
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,440
 And we know what happens then in Genesis 3, as we turn the page of the Bible.

151
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,680
 And Adam and Eve, through their disobedience to the things that God had called them to,

152
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,320
 bring sin into the world.

153
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,160
 And that ruptures that relationship, that intimacy they had in that garden, didn't it?

154
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,200
 And here's an interesting thing that happens.

155
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,760
 God pushes them out intentionally from the garden.

156
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,960
 In other words, he pushes them away from that intimacy that they had experienced because

157
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,680
 sin had now driven a wedge between the human and the divine.

158
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,720
 In a way, Adam and Eve are pushed out to be orphans in the world.

159
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,680
 And the rest of the biblical narrative is really Adam and Eve and then humanity trying

160
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,560
 to get back into right relationship with God, trying to do all that they can to win God's

161
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
 favor again.

162
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,240
 They even try to build a tower that reaches up to the heavens so that they can be with

163
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
 God again.

164
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,640
 And God comes and says, "That's not the way this works.

165
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,060
 You have created the division, but if it's going to be restored, it's going to be restored

166
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
 at my hand."

167
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,760
 And God comes and he takes Abraham.

168
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,880
 He actually changes his name.

169
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
 His name's Abram.

170
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,720
 He changes it to Abraham.

171
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
 And he gives him a calling.

172
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,560
 "You'll be a blessing to all nations."

173
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,000
 And through Abraham comes the Lion of Israel.

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
 And through that comes the people of God.

175
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,480
 And God meets with them and is intimate with them and begins to show them a way, teaches

176
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,720
 them their character, gives them the law, helps them to understand how to live as representatives

177
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,800
 of his in the world.

178
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,180
 But that divide is still there and that sin still gets in the way.

179
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,400
 So God sends Jesus.

180
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,760
 Jesus through his life and his death and his resurrection pays the price for that brokenness

181
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,800
 and that division, stands in the gap.

182
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,280
 The Bible describes it as reconciling us back to him, creating shalom again, peace

183
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,600
 between humanity and God.

184
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,120
 He's declared Jesus the Prince of Peace.

185
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,920
 And in the Prince of Peace, as he reconciles us back to God, Paul then, writing to the

186
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,160
 early church, says this.

187
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
 Guess what?

188
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,320
 You're not just reconciled to God.

189
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,640
 Now you are reconcilers in the world.

190
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,440
 You've been given the ministry of reconciliation.

191
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,240
 And as you do that, guess what?

192
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,960
 You are doing that because you are now changed in your status with God.

193
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,760
 And the language that is used by Paul in the New Testament and the early church is the

194
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,520
 language of adoption.

195
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,000
 You've been adopted into God's family, that he, through the life, death and resurrection

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,860
 of Jesus, not because of what you've done, but because of what he's done, you are now

197
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,200
 swept up in a new story.

198
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,800
 And so what is that name that is the most valuable, beautiful name you could ever be

199
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,600
 called?

200
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,640
 Child of God.

201
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,840
 You're a son and daughter of God, a child of God, meaning you are now adopted into his

202
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,520
 family, meaning that your name has changed, your future has changed, your trajectory in

203
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,840
 life has changed.

204
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,300
 The enemy may have come to kill, steal and destroy, but he has come to give life and

205
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
 life abundant.

206
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,760
 And we now have this name, children of God.

207
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,920
 And that name brings authority.

208
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,320
 That name marks us for something that is different to others in the world.

209
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,840
 And we don't hold that name with a sense of human pride.

210
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:05,000
 We hold it with humility, but it fills us with an authority and a power and a destiny

211
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,160
 that can be given no other way than the fact that Jesus has called you his child.

212
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,960
 Are you with me?

213
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,800
 All of which is why it's really important what Jesus says in the Beatitudes, the Beatitudes

214
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,480
 being this manifesto for Jesus of what the kingdom of God is all about.

215
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,520
 And I want you to read this or I'm going to read this to you from Matthew 5, verse 9.

216
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:37,720
 It says this, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."

217
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,600
 Sit with that for a moment.

218
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,520
 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they are the ones who hold my name."

219
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,720
 They're the ones who are going to live out this calling of being a child.

220
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
 Oh, it's the peacemakers.

221
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,200
 Jesus says this, and it's really interesting because it's the only time in the Beatitudes

222
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,480
 where Jesus says this, where he names something, accords people something because of an attitude

223
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
 that they have.

224
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,040
 For the other Beatitudes, what results in that attitude is a action that responds to

225
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
 that attitude.

226
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
 Give me an example.

227
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,680
 "Blessed are those who are merciful, for they will receive mercy."

228
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,200
 Or "Blessed are those who seek and hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will

229
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,520
 be filled."

230
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,920
 Or "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted."

231
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,120
 In other words, the action, the result equals to what it is that they put in.

232
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,720
 Now, if Jesus had kept that formula, here's what he would have said at Matthew 5, 9.

233
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,880
 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will know peace."

234
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,740
 But he didn't say that.

235
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,800
 He changes the formula here.

236
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,120
 And one of the questions we should ask ourselves as good Bible scholars, as we read the Bible,

237
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,840
 is why does he mess up the formula here?

238
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,400
 What does this mean to say, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be children of

239
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
 God"?

240
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,440
 Our temptation is to read that passage and go, "Well, this is a causation kind of statement."

241
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,600
 In other words, I earned my way into being in God's family by being a maker of peace.

242
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,280
 That's the wrong way to read this.

243
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,600
 That's a theological disaster.

244
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,300
 I mean, you know, right?

245
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,600
 You know that we don't earn our way into God's family.

246
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,360
 You don't earn your way into his acceptance and into his love.

247
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,480
 In fact, it's given to us through faith in grace.

248
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,000
 A very important passage to read here in relation to Matthew 5, 9 is John 1, verse 12.

249
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,280
 "All who have received him, all who have believed in his name, have the right to be

250
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,640
 called children of God."

251
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,400
 In other words, you don't earn it.

252
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,180
 You don't work towards it.

253
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,180
 You accept it.

254
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,240
 You receive it.

255
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,320
 You recognize that Christ has died for your sins.

256
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,940
 And when you bring that to him, you're set free and you find new life.

257
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,360
 And just because of that, you're a son, you're a daughter, you're a child of God.

258
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,960
 So when Jesus says, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be named, called children of

259
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,960
 God," what is he saying here?

260
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,480
 He's saying that your peacemaking doesn't cause you to be in your family.

261
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,840
 Your peacemaking shows the world that you're a part of my family.

262
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,160
 It's Jesus saying, "You want to know what my children look like?

263
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,560
 They look like people who make peace."

264
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,320
 A few years ago, my daughter Mia, she wanted to start to learn how to skateboard.

265
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,860
 I was so excited because I grew up as a skateboarder.

266
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,040
 Skateboarding was my big passion when I was a teenager into my early 20s.

267
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,520
 When I turned 40, I had a midlife crisis and I couldn't afford a motorbike, so I brought

268
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,480
 a skateboard.

269
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,360
 I love skateboarding, always have, always followed it.

270
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,160
 And a few years ago, my daughter said, "Daddy, I've seen you skateboard.

271
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
 I want to try it."

272
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,940
 I was like, "This is the best day of my life."

273
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,760
 So we brought her a skateboard, we brought her all the pads, made sure it was safe.

274
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,600
 We took her to the skate park and I was amazed, blown away.

275
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
 She went up in the slopes and down the slopes.

276
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,160
 I mean, within the first day, she was skating so confidently and I realized that she had

277
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,160
 the same anointing that her father had.

278
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:16,440
 And I was so impressed because everybody thinks it's DNA, but it's not always biological.

279
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,500
 And as she's skateboarding, this is what comes out of my mouth, almost naturally without

280
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,880
 me even thinking about it.

281
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,360
 That's my girl.

282
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,000
 Are you with me?

283
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,520
 And this is what Jesus is saying.

284
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,880
 He's saying, "You know what?

285
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,760
 When you walk into a difficult conflict, when you brave a hard conversation that you've

286
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,820
 been putting off, when you humble yourself towards somebody that you've upset and there's

287
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,760
 a division, when you actually become a maker of peace, I step back and I go, 'That's my

288
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,560
 girl.

289
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,600
 That's my boy right there.

290
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
 That's my child.

291
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,480
 Blessed are the peacemakers for they are the ones that prove they are my children.'"

292
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,960
 Are you with me?

293
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,080
 Oh, this is so beautiful and deeply challenging.

294
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,240
 Because if this is true, then perhaps one of the most important things that the people

295
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:15,100
 of God must do at all times is everyday peacemaking.

296
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,440
 And I think that raises a challenging question for us as a church in this time.

297
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,480
 Are we proving to be God's children in the very hour of Hong Kong's history when we need

298
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,000
 to be the most?

299
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,780
 Are we?

300
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:42,200
 Because blessed are the peacemakers for they're the ones where I'm going to go, "That's mine.

301
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
 That's Mia.

302
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
 Mine."

303
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,920
 I want to unpack for you a little bit what peacemaking is all about today because I want

304
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:57,480
 to call us as a church to it because I believe that as we reopen ourselves after this fifth

305
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,840
 wave, there is no more important thing for us to be doing than being makers of peace.

306
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,760
 What does Jesus mean when he says, "Blessed are the peacemakers"?

307
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,600
 Well, let me tell you what he didn't say.

308
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:16,320
 He didn't say this, "Blessed are the peacekeepers for they will be called children of God."

309
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,720
 Peacekeepers are those who will do everything in their power to avoid conflict.

310
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,400
 Peacekeepers are those that will submit to compromise all the time.

311
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,920
 They were the ones who will do whatever it can to make sure that no one is upset with

312
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
 them.

313
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
 No one is upset with anybody else, that everything is okay, right?

314
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
 Everything's okay.

315
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
 I'm sure everything's okay.

316
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
 Are you sure it's okay?

317
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,440
 I'm not sure if it's okay, but we're going to pretend it's okay, right?

318
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,000
 Peacekeepers are those that will compromise their values and their beliefs at times to

319
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,760
 ensure that there is just this kind of sense of harmony amongst people.

320
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,080
 They're the ones that are going to do their very best not to upset anybody.

321
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,280
 There might be a raging elephant in the corner of the room, but they are serving tea with

322
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,920
 a fake smile on their face.

323
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,320
 Jesus didn't say, "Blessed are the peacekeepers."

324
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,760
 That's not the way of Jesus.

325
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:11,600
 Jesus never advocated for peace through self-ignorance or avoidant behavior.

326
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:20,080
 In fact, sometimes Jesus was willing to break the false peace of the status quo in order

327
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,840
 to actually build the true peace of the kingdom of God.

328
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,680
 We saw one of those very moments last week, didn't we, when he walked into the temple

329
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:36,760
 and overturned the tables there, upsetting the false peace of the status quo of the temple.

330
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:44,480
 See, peacekeeping is passive, but peacemaking is active.

331
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,800
 Jesus also didn't say this.

332
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:52,840
 He didn't say, "Blessed are the peace lovers, for they will be called children of God."

333
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,360
 Everybody loves the idea of peace.

334
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
 Oh, yeah.

335
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,400
 I challenge you to find someone who doesn't like the idea.

336
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 "I like war.

337
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
 I want war."

338
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,800
 Most people love peace, and they'll tweet about it.

339
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,040
 They'll post about it.

340
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,880
 They'll hashtag about it.

341
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,120
 They'll put something up on Instagram that fights for peace, that says something.

342
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,560
 They'll quote some famous person that said something about peace.

343
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:19,320
 Oh, everybody wants to be a peace lover, but nobody actually wants to do the hard work

344
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,640
 of creating peace.

345
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,320
 So you can be a peace lover all you want, and you can wax lyrical about it, but if you're

346
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,640
 not actually working in your life towards creating and building peace, then you are

347
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,160
 not a child of God.

348
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,520
 You're not someone God's going to stand over and say, "Hey, well done.

349
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,560
 Well done for having the idea of peace.

350
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
 Great job.

351
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,320
 Oh, well done for having a heart towards peace.

352
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
 That's nice."

353
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,460
 No, no, this person right here is walking into conflict and doing the hard work of extending

354
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,360
 their hands towards those who are opposed to one another and doing their best through

355
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:56,520
 a self-sacrificial moment of love to see two people who cannot talk together and build

356
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,240
 a bridge towards them.

357
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,480
 That is someone who is making peace.

358
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,880
 And I have to be really careful not to stand up here today, and I was challenged on this

359
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,200
 this week as I was preparing this message, but I cannot stand before you as a peace lover.

360
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,520
 I have to try to stand before you as someone committed to the hard work of peace.

361
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,960
 Jesus also didn't say this.

362
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,520
 He didn't say, "Blessed are the peace achievers, for they will be called children of God."

363
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,320
 And I'm so glad he didn't say that.

364
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,520
 Because you know what?

365
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:32,280
 No matter how hard we might try sometimes, sometimes we can't achieve peace.

366
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,740
 Sometimes peace is elusive to us.

367
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,280
 Sometimes peace seems to be a little bit too far away.

368
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,200
 Sometimes despite our efforts, the other person that we're trying to be reconciled to doesn't

369
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,880
 want to be reconciled to, and we feel a failure because of that.

370
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,320
 Jesus did not say, "Blessed are the peace achievers."

371
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,280
 He said, "Blessed are the ones who are committed to the process of working towards peace."

372
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,080
 You have to read Matthew 5, 9 in conjunction with Romans 12, 18.

373
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,820
 There it says this, "If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with one

374
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,820
 another."

375
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,120
 I love the practicality of Paul.

376
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,120
 "If possible," because it isn't always possible.

377
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,600
 But if it is possible, live at peace with one another.

378
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,720
 But then notice this, even if it is not possible, you better make sure that you're not the one

379
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,240
 who's holding up the peace.

380
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,720
 In other words, as far as it depends on you.

381
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,520
 The ball's in your court in God's eyes.

382
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,440
 And he's saying, "You better be working all you can towards making peace."

383
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,920
 And sometimes that peace will not be achievable because there's some other things happening.

384
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,560
 The other person's not willing to respond.

385
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,000
 The other side is staying away.

386
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
 I understand that.

387
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,080
 But you better be making sure that you're not a conduit to breaking peace.

388
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,760
 You better make sure that you're doing everything that you can to live peacefully with the people

389
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,400
 around you, holding out your hands, building those roles, walking in the conflict as much

390
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,040
 as you can, because blessed are the peacemakers, not the peace achievers.

391
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,120
 "Trust me with the achievement of peace," Jesus is saying to his people.

392
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,480
 "Put it in my hands.

393
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,320
 It's my grace ultimately that creates peace."

394
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:19,880
 Overall, give up your life, pick up your cross, lay down your pride, lay down even

395
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:32,800
 the fact that you think you're right, and love your neighbor and your enemy as yourself.

396
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,360
 Our ultimate example of a peacemaker, of course, is Jesus Christ.

397
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,840
 He's our example and our mentor.

398
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,600
 And a quick look at his life will show us what peacemaking is all about.

399
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,320
 It's not easy.

400
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:52,240
 You know, Jesus amazingly, amazingly did not bring peace for Israel through the temptation

401
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,400
 of picking up military might or physical violence.

402
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,040
 In fact, the one time where we see a disciple physically being violent to another, taking

403
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,720
 a sword and cutting off a centurion's ear, Jesus is so freaked out by this moment of

404
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,960
 violence that he picks up the bloody ear and he walks up to the soldier who must have been

405
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:17,400
 wailing his eyes out and places it on his head and prays and restores him back to life.

406
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,880
 Jesus is one who doesn't use violence to achieve peace.

407
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,840
 In fact, he's one who models something very different to us.

408
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,960
 Jesus shows us that the life and the work of the peacemaker is not some fairy tale euphoria,

409
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,240
 but it is some gritty, subversive and sacrificial life of faithfulness to God and to a kingdom

410
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,880
 that has standards that are different to the systems and powers of this world.

411
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,480
 That's Jesus.

412
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,200
 That's Jesus, the Prince of Peace, who's willing to lay down his life so that others might

413
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,680
 know reconciliation again.

414
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,200
 And one of the great arguments that comes against the church when the church tries to

415
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,400
 be a peacemaker is that oftentimes people will say, "Well, peacemakers are soft.

416
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,920
 Peacemakers are just kumbaya peace lovers.

417
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,320
 They're just interested in wiping over injustice, ignoring justice.

418
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,120
 I don't like peacemaking because it doesn't allow those who are evil to be held account

419
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
 for their evil."

420
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,600
 That's not peacemaking.

421
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,040
 That's peacekeeping.

422
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,600
 Justice's role of peacemaking never averted the reality of an injustice that has happened,

423
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,760
 never covers up the reality that an evil may have been done.

424
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:43,400
 In fact, peacemaking does not ignore injustice, nor does it advocate pressing on without addressing

425
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,320
 it.

426
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,640
 Peacemaking actually faces injustice.

427
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,160
 It actually runs and walks intentionally towards injustice and conflict and stands within it

428
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
 in order to heal it.

429
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,560
 Are you following me?

430
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,040
 This is the life of Jesus Christ.

431
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,560
 Think about it for a second.

432
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
 Step back one moment.

433
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,000
 Think about this biblically.

434
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,200
 The greatest conflict that there ever was in all of creation was that conflict in Genesis

435
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,440
 3 between humanity and God.

436
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,360
 The greatest divide that's ever happened, the one that's caused the most amount of pain

437
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,080
 is that divide that happened in that moment.

438
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,280
 And Jesus did not stand at a distance.

439
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,800
 Jesus did not ignore the reality of sin.

440
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,360
 Jesus instead decided to incarnate himself as Paul beautifully writes about in Philippians

441
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:40,880
 2, was willing to leave his kingship behind and subvert himself to being a sacrifice for

442
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,000
 all people, willing to subvert himself to the people of God, to humanity itself in order

443
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,040
 to win them, in order to love them, in order to show them a new way.

444
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,320
 He was willing to be ridiculed, spat on, sent to a cross, killed in the most painful way.

445
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
 Why?

446
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,880
 Because he was willing to be inside the very heart of the injustice of the brokenness of

447
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,580
 humanity and restore it from within.

448
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,760
 And in doing that, he shows us what reconciliation and justice truly is.

449
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,920
 And then God's people are now called to be ministers of that reconciliation.

450
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,040
 What does it mean for us to be peacemakers, to stand back, to pretend that there's a big

451
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,880
 elephant in the room and ignore it by drinking a cup of tea?

452
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,560
 Does it mean that we love justice and tweet it out and think that that's great and we've

453
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,680
 ticked that box?

454
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,760
 Or does it actually mean picking up our cross, laying down our lives, taking our pride, killing

455
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:42,320
 it, and being willing to do the hard work of being God's true children, ones that he

456
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:49,000
 can call mine?

457
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:58,960
 I think as we wrestle with this, we have to sit in this reality that peacemaking is tough,

458
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,400
 that it's scary, that it takes a lot of courage to do that kind of work.

459
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,920
 My friend and mentor, Shane Claiborne, I've followed him for many years.

460
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
 I have a relationship with him.

461
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,400
 We talked a number of times about peacemaking.

462
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,720
 He's been here at the Vine actually, talking to us at the Justice Conference about peacemaking.

463
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,360
 He wrote this, "Peacemaking doesn't mean passivity.

464
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,240
 It is the act of interrupting injustice without mirroring injustice, the act of disarming

465
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,880
 evil without destroying the evildoer, the act of finding a third way that is neither

466
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,160
 fight nor flight, but the careful, arduous pursuit of reconciliation and justice."

467
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,600
 Isn't that beautiful?

468
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,440
 God stands back from these kinds of people, and he goes, "That's my girl.

469
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,080
 That's my boy.

470
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,520
 Look at them.

471
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
 Look at them go."

472
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:53,520
 I think as we emerge from this fifth wave, as we think about what it means to be reopened

473
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:01,680
 to a Hong Kong society that is still deeply divided from three years ago, we have to emerge

474
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,800
 as makers of peace.

475
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:11,000
 I think we are in a window of opportunity because we are the only people, we are the

476
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,720
 only humans in this city, I believe, who are able to offer the brokenness and the division

477
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,000
 a new way and a new path.

478
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,920
 Surely we who have been marked as the children of God are the ones who can step forward in

479
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:29,240
 this time with a new story, with a new name on us and a new name on others and say, "We

480
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:36,680
 are willing to forge those that have been at the extremes and draw them together."

481
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,760
 Because there may not be any physical process still on our streets in Hong Kong, but there's

482
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,360
 still deep divisions in families in this city.

483
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,420
 There's still deep divisions in workplaces, in churches, in the generations of this city.

484
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,680
 Those things have not gone away.

485
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,400
 The passing of a law has not removed them from this city.

486
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,360
 And we have an opportunity to say, "There's a lot of hurting people, ourselves included."

487
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:13,000
 Oh man, though, what would it look like if we didn't take a side and we actually fought

488
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 for peace?

489
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,480
 You see, being a peacemaker is hard work.

490
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,680
 It is a lot easier to be an extremist with a perspective.

491
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,720
 Oh, it's a lot easier to take an extreme position when it comes to a divisive debate.

492
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,080
 It's a lot easier to be yellow or blue.

493
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,720
 It's a lot easier to stand for abortion or stand for pro-life.

494
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,760
 It's a lot easier to decide to stand for black or stand for white or stand for gay or stand

495
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,040
 for straight or whatever the issue might be.

496
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,680
 It's much easier to push yourself to the extreme and find a tribe there and point a finger

497
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,120
 at the people on the other side.

498
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,200
 That's the easy path, but that's not the path of Jesus.

499
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,720
 Jesus forges a narrow path, a path in the middle, one in which you take the hand of

500
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,880
 those that are deeply opposed to each other and you do the work of embracing the conversations,

501
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,080
 having the talk, embracing the words, being honest with the brokenness, talking about

502
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,800
 the hurt, not covering up the injustice, but instead working together, finding the beauty

503
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,920
 and the honor of our humanity together, seeing the moments of God, even in the other person

504
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,200
 on the other side.

505
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,080
 And when we do that, we are becoming his children, showing the world what God's family looks

506
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,280
 like.

507
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:35,940
 But if we stay on the extremes and point the finger, we are dividing and we are showing

508
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:45,600
 the world we are children of the enemy who has come to kill, divide and destroy.

509
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:54,400
 We have this invitation to stand in the middle, even if we might have opinion about which

510
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:06,200
 side might be right or wrong, and lay down our right to be right and serve the other,

511
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,760
 even the other that we disagree with.

512
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,520
 I wonder what the future of Hong Kong might look like if we really were the children of

513
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
 God.

514
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:23,360
 Now, I don't want to just be a lover of peace and not a maker of it.

515
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,360
 I want to help you with this.

516
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,240
 And I've gone a little bit long.

517
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,360
 I'm going to go another five minutes and tell you how to do this.

518
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
 Is that okay?

519
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,600
 Because I know you want to know how.

520
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,680
 You're like, "Okay, Andrew, that's a lot of good stuff."

521
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,920
 All right, I get it, Andrew.

522
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,560
 You've won me over with Scripture.

523
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,320
 I still have no idea how I do this.

524
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,680
 "Oh, Andrew, you don't know about my situation.

525
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,160
 You don't know how bad that is.

526
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,760
 You haven't seen the division that I'm dealing with.

527
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,880
 There's no way that could be fixed."

528
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,520
 Here's a couple of quick practical ways that you can be an everyday peacemaker.

529
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,720
 And this is where the last two weeks of this course, of this time together, has all come

530
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
 together.

531
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,640
 This is the culmination of what this has all been about.

532
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
 Here's the first thing.

533
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,740
 We begin our healing journey.

534
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:05,520
 You can't be a peacemaker if there is still deep trauma inside of you.

535
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,120
 And in week one, I spoke about the power and the need that we have for forgiveness, for

536
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,880
 mercy, for God's love to restore and renew us.

537
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:17,560
 Oh, we lean into Him in our healing journey so that we go forward as peacemakers, not

538
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,800
 perfect but ones that have received the touch and heal and liberation and reconciliation

539
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
 of God.

540
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
 That's week one.

541
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,880
 Week two, here's the second thing.

542
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,640
 We deal with our sin.

543
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:32,200
 Week two, I said, we have to go and invite Jesus into our temple and allow Him to turn

544
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,280
 over some tables that need to be turned over.

545
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,640
 We need to deal with our sin.

546
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,920
 We need to make sure that as we move forward as peacemakers, that we're again, not perfect

547
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,000
 people but people under the grace of God.

548
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,720
 And here's what will happen every single time.

549
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,680
 Your sin will drive you to the extremes.

550
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,960
 It is God's grace and forgiveness, His holiness and purity that will sustain you in the middle

551
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
 space.

552
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,080
 Here's the third thing.

553
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,160
 Embrace relational proximity.

554
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,820
 What that means is you cannot hope to be a peacemaker and stay removed from the people

555
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,280
 you're trying to build peace with.

556
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,200
 It means that you cannot try to be a peacemaker and try to stay away, not know, not be in

557
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,720
 relationship with the ones that perhaps are hurting you, upsetting you.

558
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,760
 Oh, well, we have to have relational proximity.

559
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,640
 Jesus modeled for this beautifully.

560
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,880
 He hung with the sinner.

561
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,380
 He hung with the outcast.

562
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,840
 He hung with the ones that weren't allowed in the temple, the ones that were unclean.

563
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,040
 And equally, He hung with those with power.

564
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,560
 He hung with the Pharisees.

565
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,420
 And with every single one, He ministered justice, truth, reconciliation, love.

566
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,500
 He didn't choose sides.

567
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,420
 He drew people to the kingdom of God.

568
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,700
 If you want to be an everyday peacemaker, you have to be willing to get to know some

569
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,260
 people that you don't like.

570
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
 Here's the third thing.

571
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
 Fourth thing, maybe.

572
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,100
 I can't remember.

573
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,420
 Think beyond ourselves.

574
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,100
 This is a hard one to do.

575
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,460
 It's easy for us to think about our own situation and our own circumstance.

576
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,180
 "Oh, pastor, my situation is X, Y, and Z."

577
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,900
 If you want to be an everyday peacemaker, you have to think beyond just your circumstance

578
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,500
 and think about the issue from the other person's perspective.

579
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,460
 Think about what it might be like that they're going through, what it is that they're challenged

580
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,400
 with, how they might feel in this situation, how even your own actions and words may have

581
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,180
 impacted them on their side.

582
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,020
 That's a very difficult thing to do.

583
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:29,580
 But this is a kingdom of God thing because Jesus came to the world and never sinned.

584
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:34,420
 But he looked on the other side to us who are sinners, and he understood our pain, and

585
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,620
 he went to the cross because he believed he could heal that pain.

586
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,620
 Here's the next thing.

587
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,740
 Look for collaboration with the people you don't like.

588
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,740
 Guess what?

589
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,260
 The person you don't like and the person on the other side is not the sum total of the

590
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,260
 thing that's the issue.

591
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,620
 That's not the sum total of who they are.

592
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,020
 There are some beautiful moments of humanity in them.

593
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,980
 There are some beautiful moments of the goodness of God in them.

594
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,800
 And where we as everyday peacemakers, one of our skills is to look for the good in people,

595
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,640
 to look for the humanity in people.

596
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,180
 And when we find it, we connect to it and we say, "We're not that different.

597
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,140
 You and I, we're actually kind of same in many ways.

598
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,740
 And yeah, we might disagree with this thing, and that's a big thing, but we truly love

599
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,140
 one another, right?

600
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,820
 We can truly see that I'm grateful for you for this, and you're grateful for me for this,

601
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:25,100
 and we look for ways we can collaborate because in collaboration, it doesn't solve everything,

602
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:30,220
 but it begins to forge a new path of friendship and respect.

603
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,220
 Here's the final thing.

604
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,580
 See it through.

605
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,340
 Now you're not going to be a peace achiever.

606
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:40,220
 It's not seeing it through to get the achievement of peace, to get the badge of the person of

607
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,220
 peace.

608
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,500
 No, it's to see it through so that you're doing everything in your power to bring peace

609
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,620
 through your everyday actions and your words and the things that you do.

610
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:54,140
 Knowing that as far as it depends on you, live at peace with others, see it through,

611
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,180
 be committed to the long haul of the way in which you need to humble yourselves, lay down

612
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,280
 your pride, apologize for the words you've said, apologize for the divide that you've

613
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,580
 created in others, and work your best to brave the hard conversations and to walk intentionally

614
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,220
 into the brokenness in order to heal it from within.

615
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,700
 You are the children of God.

616
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,860
 And God stands over you and he says, "You are mine.

617
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,420
 Your little Mia's, if you will."

618
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:32,180
 Would we rise up as his children in this critical hour of Hong Kong's history?

619
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:38,220
 Would we not keep the peace, not love the peace?

620
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,420
 Would we make the peace?

621
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,740
 Because Christ has made it for us.

622
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,780
 I wonder if you'd stand with me.

623
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,060
 I'd love to pray for you.

624
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:56,540
 If you're online now, you can just close your eyes as well.

625
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,740
 I wonder whether you'd just be comfortable to open your hands online and in this room

626
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:05,660
 if this is speaking to you today, if this is a moment for you just to humble yourself

627
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,660
 before the Lord.

628
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:11,580
 We do that here at the Vine as a posture of receiving as we pray.

629
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:21,140
 Father, we come before you now as ones who understand division and disruption, as ones

630
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:25,060
 who have contributed to disruption and division.

631
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:33,020
 Father, we come to you now recognizing that we're not always the children of God in this

632
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,020
 area.

633
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:40,620
 But Father, we also come to you now with the weight of this time in history on our

634
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:46,660
 shoulders and the wonderful opportunity we have to make a difference.

635
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:56,220
 Lord, we ask you to forgive us where we have tried to keep the peace and ignored the injustice,

636
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:02,940
 tried to keep the peace by burying our heads in the sand at times.

637
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:11,620
 Forgive us where we've found it easy to be lovers of peace, to talk about it, to shout

638
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:19,140
 about it, to post about it, but where we haven't lifted a single finger to repair the broken

639
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:25,420
 relationships that are in our own lives or to speak out in our workplaces or in the areas

640
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:32,180
 of our influence, to humble ourselves and to bring the two to be together as one.

641
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,660
 Thank us, Lord.

642
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:41,140
 Father, I want to pray for your Holy Spirit to come now on this group of people online

643
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,780
 in this room.

644
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:48,260
 Father, you commission us here today to be makers of peace.

645
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:54,220
 Lord, would you humble us, give us courage.

646
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,140
 Lord, there are people in this room that need to brave a conversation that they've been

647
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,140
 avoiding.

648
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,100
 I want to pray by the power of the Holy Spirit.

649
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,180
 Lord, would you give them the courage this week to have that conversation they've been

650
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,180
 putting off.

651
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,140
 Father, there are some people in this room that need to admit that they were wrong and

652
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,580
 their pride has kept them from doing that.

653
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,580
 And that pride has created a division.

654
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:21,060
 Lord, would you give them the courage this week to ask for forgiveness.

655
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:26,220
 Lord, there are some in this room that have deeply been hurt by others.

656
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:32,740
 And Lord, I want to pray for those people, that as they commit to waging peace in the

657
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:39,340
 future, that you would meet them in the places of their hurt and heal and restore and redeem

658
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,540
 them, Lord.

659
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,500
 Father, we thank you that you call us your children.

660
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
 What a privilege that is.

661
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,020
 And so I want to speak over every person here.

662
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,300
 You might be thinking right now, this is not going to work in my situation.

663
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,620
 You might be here right now and go, "Pastor, have you understood the depth of my division?

664
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,540
 Have you understood what I'm going through?"

665
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,660
 You would know that these nice words of yours today, they don't really scratch the surface

666
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,660
 of what I'm facing.

667
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,700
 I want you to hear this.

668
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,580
 I don't fully understand.

669
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,860
 No, but there is one who does.

670
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,780
 And that one has called you his son or his daughter.

671
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,500
 That one has claimed you as his child.

672
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,540
 And because you are his child, you do not stand defeated.

673
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,420
 Because you are his child, you are not worn down or beaten up.

674
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,780
 Because you are his child, you are not removed.

675
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,460
 God is here to fight battles that you cannot fight.

676
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,160
 You are a child of God.

677
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,100
 There is an authority upon you.

678
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,020
 There is the spirit of God in you.

679
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:43,700
 The same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead exists, has its life, is flourishing

680
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,700
 in you.

681
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,300
 And yes, it might be difficult right now, but you are not done.

682
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,820
 You are not defeated.

683
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,740
 This is not the end for you.

684
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:58,180
 There is a God who has made peace, not just for you, but shalom for this world.

685
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,980
 And he will fill you with the courage, with the spirit, with the hope, and with the power

686
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,140
 to be a reconciler in this place.

687
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:12,780
 And so Lord, I want to pray that you would release faith over the people in this room,

688
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,460
 that you need to release faith over Lord.

689
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:25,820
 And I pray that we would fight, not with violence, not with the world's method of fighting,

690
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:37,100
 but we would fight forwards with the weapons of the kingdom, humility, forgiveness, reconciliation,

691
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:43,860
 grace, love for enemy, for neighbor, for ourselves.

692
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:47,020
 Lord, we thank you for this.

693
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:52,380
 In Jesus name, everyone says, amen.

694
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,900
 Two things very quickly before you go.

695
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:00,700
 The first is this, you do not need to go.

696
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,380
 I want to invite you to stay.

697
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,340
 I want to invite you to pray.

698
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,340
 We have a prayer team here.

699
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,340
 We have a prayer team here.

700
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,900
 We have a prayer team online.

701
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,440
 We can connect right now with somebody to pray with them.

702
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,240
 If you're feeling a stirring in your spirit today, if this is a helpful word in season

703
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,980
 for you, I want to encourage you not just to receive a prayer from me and shoot off

704
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,980
 for lunch.

705
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,380
 I want to encourage you to do some real work by praying for one another, loving one another,

706
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,420
 listening to one another, and asking for help in this time.

707
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,420
 All right?

708
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,700
 So I want to encourage you to do that.

709
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,380
 Here's the second thing, and you're going to love, love, love this.

710
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:47,380
 We are getting rid of the pre-registration system.

711
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,340
 I know you guys have been so incredibly faithful.

712
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,460
 We're so grateful that you've done that.

713
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:57,180
 The government announced this week that on May 18th, churches and cinemas are able to

714
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,700
 reopen at 85%.

715
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,460
 And we know just because of the numbers that we've had here, we haven't really even been

716
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,780
 hitting 50% of some of our services.

717
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,500
 So the need for that pre-registration system now is not anymore needed.

718
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,460
 So in other words, you can come next week for Vision Sunday on May 15th, and you can

719
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,460
 just show up.

720
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,460
 Isn't that nice?

721
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,460
 I'm excited about that.

722
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,460
 We're so grateful for that.

723
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:23,460
 But thank you again for being so willing and patient with us as we've done the registration

724
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,460
 system.

725
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,940
 I hope we never need to do it again.

726
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,500
 Famous last words.

727
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,260
 But at least from next Sunday onwards, just come.

728
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,260
 We'd love to have you here.

729
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,940
 Tell friends, tell neighbors.

730
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,460
 We'd love to join together.

731
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,980
 May you go from here as children of God, makers of peace, and may it fill you with hope and

732
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,980
 love and life.

733
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,980
 God bless everyone.

734
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,540
 Thanks so much.

735
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,700
 (audience applauding)
