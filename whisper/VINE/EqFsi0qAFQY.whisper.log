[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   So I have the habit of taking songs and changing lyrics.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   And so even though it's going to be a little bit cringe,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   I'm going to do that for you, okay?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   So I came up with this earlier.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   I was listening to one of the songs playing, and it says,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   "I want to wish you a singed-on firelock.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I want to wish you a singed-on firelock.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   I want to wish you a singed-on firelock
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   from the bottom of my heart."
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   [applause]
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   So, yeah, I know.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Thank you for making me feel better about this.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   But I have actually a question for us as we get started,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   and it is this.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   What is your favorite Christmas song?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Now, this could be a Christmas carol.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   This can be a pop song.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   This can be a classical piece.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And I'm actually not asking a rhetorical question.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I actually really want to hear from you,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   and this includes you kids.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   You know, what is your favorite song?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   So if you have one to share, just raise your hand,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   and I'll call on you and share with me your song.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Yes.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   "Last Christmas."
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   "Last Christmas."
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   [applause]
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Right there.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   You and I.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It's my favorite.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Good one, good one.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Actually, I'm going to talk about that later.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   That was perfect.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   What else?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   What else do we have?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Yes.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   My son's favorite is "Mistletoe."
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   "Mistletoe."
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Okay.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   [laughter]
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   So I don't know that one, but I'm sure it's a great one.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I heard something over here.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Yes, go ahead.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   "All I Want for Christmas."
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   What?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   [laughter]
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Is it that one?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   "All I Want for Christmas is You."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Yes.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   That's also a good one.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Mariah Carey.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Okay, one more.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Let's do one more.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Yes, back there.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   What's that?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   So there's a classic as well.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So, hey, these are some incredible songs that you chose
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   to share with us.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Thank you so much also for everyone who did that
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   who was brave.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Appreciate that.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Now, I don't know if you've ever noticed that around Christmas
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   there's all this singing, and there are all these songs,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   whether Christian or in pop culture,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and there's just something about Christmas that even changes
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   our playlists.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Like on Spotify, it's like the only time where I wrote in
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   quite different playlists in the year, right?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And so why is that?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   What is it about Christmas that brings forth all these songs,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   all this singing?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And I don't know if you knew, but actually in the Bible,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   there's also three Christmas songs that are part
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   of the biblical story.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So I want to share with you today my favorite song
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   and show you something amazing in it.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So let me take you to Luke chapter 2,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   and starting in verse 8, it says this.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   "And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   keeping watch over their flock at night.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And an angel of the Lord appeared to them,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and the glory of the Lord shone around them,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and they were terrified.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   But the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all people.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   He is the Messiah, the Lord.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   This will be a sign to you.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.'
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Suddenly a great company of heavenly hosts appeared
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   with the angel, praising God and saying,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   'Glory to the God in the highest heaven and on earth peace
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   to those on whom his favor rests.'"
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   So that part is actually a song that I'm talking about.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And then continuing in verse 15,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   "When the angels had left them and gone into heaven,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   the shepherds said to one another,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   'Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   which the Lord has told us about.'
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   and the baby who was lying in a manger.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   When they had seen him, they spread the word
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   concerning what had been told them about this child,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   and all who heard it were amazed with the shepherds,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   what the shepherds said to them.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   But Mary treasured up all these things
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and pondered them in her heart.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   for all the things they had heard and seen,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   which were just as they had been told."
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So for me, it's fascinating that the birth of Jesus
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   brings forward singing, this joy.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And I don't know if you've ever had this experience in your life.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   You receive some good news and you cannot help but to sing,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   maybe do a little happy dance.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   You know, people do that in different ways.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And there's just something that is so good
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   that just needs to be expressed, you know,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   through singing or dancing.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   But what is it about Jesus, this child that is born,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   that brings forth these songs and this praise?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   You know, what is it? Why is that?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   So I want to share with you some thoughts on that.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   So first, an angel appears to the shepherds in the fields,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and there's something he says,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   "I bring you good news that will cause great joy
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   for all the people.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   He is the Messiah, and he is the Lord."
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So the good news is announced by the angel.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   He uses three really loaded and charged words.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It's like dropping three, you know, bombs with so much meaning,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   basically, on the shepherds.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And it's even hard to do justice to talk about
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   what these three words in that first century context meant.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Savior, Messiah, Lord.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I'm going to just very briefly talk about them.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   But there's so much more to it.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   But let me just briefly talk about it.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   The first one is Savior.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Jesus' birth is good news because he's a Savior,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   because he has come to be born, to die for our sins,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   so that we can be restored back to the Father,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   that we can experience wholeness and also peace in our lives.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   So Jesus is Savior.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   He comes because we need rescuing.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   You know, if there is no need for a Savior,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   no Savior needs to come.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   But Jesus comes because we need it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And secondly, Jesus' birth is good news because he's the Messiah.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   There were all these--there were expectations.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   God promised that the liberator would come to set his people free
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   and restore them back to prominence and establish God's rule.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And so now the angel announces to the Israelites this promise
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   after 400 years of silence from the prophets,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   that this promise of a Messiah is finally being fulfilled.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   This is incredible news.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And then finally, we're also told that Jesus is Lord.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   That means that Jesus is God.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   He's God with us.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And that's very important because it means that he has the power
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   and authority to actually bring about the saving and the healing in our lives.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Because if I die for somebody, it doesn't do anything for anyone really.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   But when Jesus does that, he really has the power and authority to save
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   and to move and to act in our lives.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   So it's no wonder that the angels--that they hear this--the shepherds,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   they hear this incredible message from the angels,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   and then the angels can't help themselves.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And so first there's one, now suddenly a host of angels appears.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   The whole sky is filled.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   A host means it's basically a term actually for army.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   So there's an army of angels, a large group of angels filling the sky,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   and they are singing and praising God.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   They're saying, "Glory to God in the highest heaven and on earth,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   peace to those on whom his favor rests."
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And so the angel songs, it adds further to describing what this good news is.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   So first we had Savior, Messiah, Lord.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Now we have also the word peace.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   So their song expresses that God's desire for all people is peace.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Now this could sound very generic, but it's actually a very powerful
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   and important concept.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Underlying this is actually a Hebrew word,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   even though the biblical text is in Greek,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   but it was Hebrews who were writing and authoring this.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And that's the word shalom.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And shalom in the shortest, simplest way means wholeness,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   that Jesus has come to bring wholeness,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   wholeness in our relationship with God,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   wholeness in our relationship with each other,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   wholeness in relationship even to creation,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   wholeness in relationship to ourselves,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   because a lot of times we're even at odds with ourselves.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And so that is what the angel is announcing.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And you know this peace, this shalom, is actually available to you right now.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   You might not feel that way, but this peace is available to you right now.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   So the peace that Jesus brings, it's different than worldly peace.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Worldly peace is usually something we have good finances,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   we have good relationships, everything is going right in our lives,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   then we have peace.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   And even then, sometimes we actually don't have peace, right?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Even if all those things are in place.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   But then when our circumstances change,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   and maybe those things, they fall out of place,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   then that peace is gone.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And we lack peace.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   But what the angel is announcing is that Jesus,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   he brings a peace that is not dependent on our circumstances,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   that is greater than our circumstances.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   That it does not matter what is going on in your life,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   that Jesus can meet you, and he can give you peace
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   despite the storms, the challenges that you are facing.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And it really is a supernatural thing,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   because we cannot do this on our own.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   It's only something that God can do in our lives.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   So I don't know if you are having peace this Christmas.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I've been a pastor long enough that I know that there's a lot of challenges.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Maybe there's relationship problems, maybe there's finance problems,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   family problems, personal failures, health problems, emotional problems.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   All these things that can steal the peace, the hope, the joy that we have,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   they can pull the rug from underneath us in our lives.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   But that's why Jesus came.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   That's why he's born.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   He wants to restore us, to bring hope, to bring peace, to bring wholeness.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   You know, where there's brokenness, where we're a mess.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And he wants to meet us in our uncertainties, in our questions, in our struggles.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And he wants to give us his peace and his wholeness
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   that only God can give, that nothing else in this world can bring.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And this peace is found when we have a personal relationship with Jesus.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And when we learn to just live in this relationship,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   when we learn to live in this trust,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   and learn to walk through things with him and depend on him,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   the Spirit of God brings us peace upon our lives.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   So Jesus, he came, he was born to die,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   because he loves you so much.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   He came, he laid down his life so that we can be forgiven,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   so that our relationship that is broken with God can be restored,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   and to bring just his wholeness and his goodness into our lives.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And so with Jesus we can face anything.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   He loves you, he's for you, he's not against you.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   He has given everything.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   He was God eternally,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   and he humbles himself, he was born as a little helpless child,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   so that he can reveal to us God's love,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   reveal to us how he feels about us,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   and then ultimately lay down his life for us.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   So that's why Jesus came, to bring salvation,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   to bring his peace, to bring wholeness into our brokenness.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   But it even gets, you know, this news actually gets better.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   The good news of Christ's birth is not just good news for a select few.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   It's not just for the super Christian,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   it's not just for those who always do good,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   it's not for those who've been living this perfect track record life.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   In verse 10 it says, you know,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   that the good news will cause great joy for all the people.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   So this good news is available for all.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Sometimes we feel it's just for those special people who have their life all together.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   It might even seem that those who are on the margins,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   those who are struggling, that Christmas and this whole Jesus and all this peace,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   that's not for them, it's not for us.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   But when the angel appeared to shepherds,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   who were people who were on the margins,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   who were people, you know, they were not good with social relationships,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   so they had the job as a shepherd.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And they were marginalized in society, were looked down upon.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   But God chose to reveal this good news to them.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   And by doing that he's saying, you are significant.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   This good news is for you.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   This is not just for people in the center of power
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   or for the people who are the majority stockholders of this company.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   This is good news for everyone.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Doesn't matter what social status, doesn't matter what life record track you're on.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   So this means whether you are Christian here or not,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   whether you are living a good life or you're living a bad life,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   whether you feel close to God or right now God seems as far away as you can imagine,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   the good news of Christmas is for you.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   And it is available to you because it is grounded not in your goodness,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   not in your behavior, but in God's love, his character, his grace and mercy for you.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   He has chosen to love you.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   He has given everything for you.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   He is for you.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And he is offering us this relationship and this peace to us.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And so the peace that is available through Jesus is God's gracious and undeserved gift offered to all.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Doesn't matter who you are.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Doesn't matter if you feel like you're not qualified.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   It is for you.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   And so that's why this is my favorite Christmas song in the Bible.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Because this truly is good news for everyone, not just for a few.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Now what I love about the story is that it's not only the angels singing and praising God,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   but actually they're declaring this great news and they're inviting other people to join and sing.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And that's also an invitation to us to join in with singing and with praise in this good news.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Now don't worry, I'm actually not going to make you sing like I did earlier.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   And there's actually something deeper and more important to the singing.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   There's actually deeper parts, so let me explain this.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   In the story we see that the shepherds, they receive that announcement.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   And they could have just gone, "Oh, thanks for letting us know," and they can move on with their lives.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   But they go and they see for themselves that what the angels had is truly true.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And then they cannot help but also join in singing.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   They receive this good news themselves.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   This good news has moved from kind of this announcement out there to suddenly it's become personal good news.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   It's good news for them personally, not for other people, but for them personally.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   That Jesus is Savior and Messiah and Lord.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   So there's a shift that takes place.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And the same is true for us.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   This is good news of Christmas.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   It needs to be something that we receive.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   So we need to receive this good news that breaks into the night, even in the darkest nights of our lives, of our souls.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   We can't earn God's love and His saving and holiness bringing work.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   We can only receive it and have Him meet us in whatever it is that is going on.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Have break into the darkness, the struggle, the pain, whatever it is.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   But we need to receive it.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   It's like any gift.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   It's only yours when you actually take it and receive it.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   So I want to share with you how you can respond to this incredible news of Jesus' saving and peace bringing work.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And I'm going to go a little bit out on a limb here, kind of like earlier in my message.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I'm going to use a little bit of a silly illustration, but I think it will make it helpful.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   And it's from what I was saying, the Christmas song from Wham!, "Last Christmas."
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And so, production, can you please play the music?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Last Christmas I gave you my heart, but the very next day you gave it away.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   This year to save you from tears, I give it to someone special.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   So we've heard these lyrics, right?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Now, while this song is of course about romantic love and heartbreak and everything,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   we join in singing and praising God by giving our hearts to the one who is truly special.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Now, we've been giving our heart to other things.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   We think we find peace and wholeness in other things.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   So we go searching, we go scrambling, we try hard.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   We try to find whether it's peace in other relationships,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   we try to find peace in finances, material possessions, and all these things.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And we're trying so hard, but they just can't deliver.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   They can't do it. They can't bring the peace of God.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Because we're trying to get these things to do what only God can do.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And so when we try to, when we basically make those things God,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and we think that they're going to bring us wholeness, that they're going to make us feel okay,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   we just end in heartbreak.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Because we've been giving our heart to the wrong things.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And so this Christmas is an invitation to give your heart to somebody who is truly special, which is Jesus.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   So don't miss the good news of Christmas and receive the good news.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Give your heart to Him.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Now some of you might say, "Is this really good news? Is this really true?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Is this guy just hyping all of this up?"
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Well, ultimately, you can only find out for yourself.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   But I want to actually right now, I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And you know, Jesus came because He loves you. He is for you.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And He wants you to know His love. He wants you to know His care.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   He wants you to know His peace. He wants to unfold wholeness, shalom, in your life.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   And He brought us about by dying on the cross for your sins.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   So that you can be forgiven and that your relationship between you and God,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   that is at odds, can be restored and you become part of God's family.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   And so in just a moment, I'm going to pray for all of us.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   But I actually want to invite everyone to stand right now.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And I want to give an opportunity for those of you who've never given their hearts to Jesus,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   to the one who is truly special.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   I want to actually just give you an opportunity to do that.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   To invite Jesus to come into your heart.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   As I was preparing for this message, I was thinking of myself.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   I became a Christian when I was a teenager.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   And I was struggling. There was anxiety. There was fear.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And there were sleepless nights for almost a year.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And then in a conversation with my father, he's like, "Have you ever placed your trust in Jesus?"
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   And really what that meant for me was just surrender.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I just surrendered to Jesus. Like, "Jesus, I can't do it.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Will you come into my life? Will you do it?"
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   So I want to invite you right now, if you've never invited Jesus in your heart,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   and if you want to express with yourself that, "Jesus, I want you. I need you."
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   You can just quietly, before you just stretch out your hands,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   you can do it like very minimal, however you want to do it, it doesn't matter.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   You can just express it.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Say, "Jesus, I want you in my life. I need you in my life.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   I want this peace. I want this relationship with you."
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   So you can do that right now.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Let me pray for you. Let me pray for all of us.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Jesus, I thank you for every hand stretched out.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   I thank you that you are the true gift of Christmas, the true peace bringer.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   I pray right now that you come into everyone's life who has stretched out their hands,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   who's saying, "Jesus, I need you. I want you."
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   I pray that this will be the greatest Christmas,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   that you will make yourself known, that you will reveal your love,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   and that you will bring your peace, your shalom, your wholeness that only you can bring,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   that you fill everyone with your Holy Spirit.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus, for life's being turned to you right now.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   We praise you.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And thank you, Jesus, for everyone else here today.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   You know everyone's journey. You know what their Christmas is like today.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I pray that you would bring your love, your comfort, your peace, your presence.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Will you show your presence that you are with us?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   And as your presence breaks upon us, as we become aware of it,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   may you fill our hearts with joy and fill our hearts with songs of praise
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   that you are the glorious Savior who loves us, who came, that's why he came.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And so we want to praise you, Lord. So I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.840]   Amen.
