[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   - Wow, so good to be with you today.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.600]   And I just want to welcome you whenever,
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.820]   wherever you're watching.
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.840]   We just would like you to know that we love you.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.000]   And we're praying for you every single day
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.620]   during this pandemic.
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.480]   And if there's anything we can do to help,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.320]   please reach out to us. Or if you're in Hong Kong,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.520]   why don't we just meet up for a chat over coffee or tea?
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.120]   I love that.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.300]   Now I know that many of you are going through stressful,
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.840]   even traumatic times.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.920]   If not you personally, then someone you know.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.480]   In the 21 day devotional series on post-traumatic growth
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.220]   that we finished last weekend,
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.760]   we followed stories of trauma and growth
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.720]   that have come from those of us at the Vine
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.760]   who've experienced this themselves
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.440]   and who've courageously shared their stories.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.200]   These stories have really challenged me
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.760]   and helped me to grow
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.080]   because I had the honor of collecting them.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.400]   Along with the sermons in the last month,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.280]   these stories have helped all of us look at the pandemic,
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.180]   at trauma in new ways.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.240]   Now, if you haven't had time to read all of these,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.100]   please go to our website
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.800]   and finish reading the ones you missed.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.160]   Now today, this is the final in our seven week series
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.200]   on post-traumatic growth,
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.220]   how God uses the most stressful and painful times
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.220]   in our lives to draw us closer to him and to each other.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.200]   A quick review, week one, wounds and scars.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.220]   The first week, Andrew set the stage for this series
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.700]   with Thomas meeting Jesus
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.700]   after witnessing the incredible trauma of the crucifixion.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.860]   Jesus shows traumatized Thomas and us
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.520]   how deep and painful wounds can become scars
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.520]   of healing and growth.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.560]   Week two, trauma can help us see new possibilities.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.960]   After Peter's massive meltdown at the crucifixion,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.400]   Jesus helped Peter over breakfast on the beach
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   to find forgiveness, to have his career transformed.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.440]   We too, with Jesus, we can move forward
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.080]   after massive setbacks and failures
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.140]   to have our lives and careers transformed.
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.820]   And trauma can change our relationships with others.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.100]   Remember week three, a few years back,
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.300]   Andrew was having panic attacks, was ready to resign.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.720]   He shared the story of the woman who was healed
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.780]   after 12 long years of trauma
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.340]   when she had the courage to reach out
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.220]   and touch the hem of Jesus' cloak
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.280]   and to step out of the crowd and tell her story.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.920]   The same can happen to us when we reach out to Jesus
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.760]   and acknowledge our suffering and trauma
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.960]   to those closest to us.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.920]   Two weeks ago, Ellison helped us to see
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.680]   how with Jesus at our side,
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   even demons and monsters can be defeated.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.980]   We can begin to experience joy,
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.460]   maybe we can even laugh in the midst of this pandemic
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.820]   that never seems to go away.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.440]   And we can share the joy of the healing and growth
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.040]   Jesus brings with the people around us,
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.980]   the people who see little reason for hope.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.600]   Last Sunday, Andrew tried to convince us
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.320]   that we can grow in our personal strength
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.200]   through even the worst kind of trauma,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.900]   persecution, torture, even imprisonment,
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.360]   and in other kinds of trauma as well.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.600]   And through God's spirit in us,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.640]   we can gain personal strength
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.560]   that not even death or the gates of hell can destroy.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.920]   Wow.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.000]   Did Andrew convince you?
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   Now, if you missed any of these messages,
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.500]   you can watch them on YouTube, Facebook,
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.440]   or you can listen to them on our website in a podcast.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.000]   Now, that brings us today to the seventh and final
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.120]   in the Post-Traumatic Growth Series,
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   how trauma forces us to ask the most fundamental questions
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.840]   about the meaning of life and faith
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.560]   and often leads to significant,
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.120]   sometimes even dramatic spiritual change.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.960]   We're looking today at trauma and spiritual change
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.080]   with a familiar character, Saul or Paul,
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.800]   depending whether you want the Hebrew
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.220]   or Greek version of his name.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.960]   Paul was sure Jesus was not the Messiah.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.000]   That was clear.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.960]   God's chosen person to fulfill the vision of the prophets,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.640]   to fulfill God's promises, no.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.880]   Jesus could not be the Messiah.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   He did not show the proper respect for the law of Moses.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.520]   He didn't even begin to break the Jewish people free
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.280]   from Roman enslavement and humiliation.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.520]   In fact, the hated Roman colonizers
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.680]   supervised the crucifixion of Jesus,
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.600]   along with a couple of thieves, thugs, no, no.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.080]   Jesus could not be the long-awaited Messiah.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.640]   And believe me, Paul would know.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.920]   This is how he described his credentials some years later.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.120]   The book of Philippians, he said,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.900]   "I was circumcised when I was eight days old.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.900]   "I'm a pure-blooded citizen of Israel.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.220]   "I'm a member of the tribe of Benjamin,
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.200]   "a real Hebrew, if there ever was one.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.900]   "I was a member of the Pharisees,
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.240]   "who demand the strictest obedience to the Jewish law.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.800]   "I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.160]   "And as for righteousness, hey,
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.000]   "I obeyed the law without fault."
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.840]   Wow.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.920]   So Paul, along with other opponents of Jesus
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.760]   who helped to get him killed, was on the defensive.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.800]   "Crucifixion should have ended it
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   "because Jesus was clearly a heretic who deserved to die.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.880]   "Jesus was on the wrong side of Jewish law
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.400]   "and God needed Paul as a defender of the faith."
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:25.140]   But how can people hatch the ridiculous conspiracy theory
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:31.580]   that Jesus has come back to life since the crucifixion?
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.460]   That's ridiculous.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.340]   So why are thousands of people becoming followers of Jesus
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.340]   after he is very clearly dead?
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.740]   Now, put yourself in Paul's shoes.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.760]   Maybe he's feeling a little bit of jealousy
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.260]   at Jesus' continuing popularity.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:03.820]   I'm wondering if Paul was experiencing stress, anxiety,
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.140]   in spite of his rock-hard conviction,
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:13.140]   Paul could be increasingly torn up inside.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.300]   He cannot ignore all the talk
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.760]   about the fantastic miracles Jesus did.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.740]   And just recently, Paul watched as Stephen,
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.500]   a young disciple of Jesus, was stoned to death.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.620]   It was bloody mob violence
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.380]   and Paul was right there applauding.
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.300]   Paul knew it was the right thing to do.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.700]   It was what the law of Moses required.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.700]   But it was a gut-wrenching, God-awful thing to watch.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:57.580]   A man dying under a hail of stones.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.260]   And yet Stephen was peaceful as he died.
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:10.940]   He claimed to have a vision of Jesus in heaven
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.760]   being in a place of highest honor.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.780]   And Stephen had a look of joy on his face
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.780]   as he said his last forgiving words.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:31.020]   "Lord, do not hold this sin against them."
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:38.460]   Paul is haunted by those last words.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:45.700]   Forgiveness, God, don't blame these men
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.880]   for what they're doing.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.280]   Surely Stephen was the one to blame, not him.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:58.020]   Paul was doing the will of God.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.860]   And Jesus in a place of highest honor in heaven?
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.900]   Unthinkable.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:09.940]   But Stephen seemed so confident
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.340]   of what he was seeing as he died.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.840]   And how could he be so forgiving?
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:22.860]   What if Stephen was right?
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.580]   No way.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.380]   For Paul, this was an impossible thought.
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.560]   Now, in spite of the reality,
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.900]   the Jesus movement is spreading like wildfire
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.020]   since Stephen's death.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:45.020]   And Paul now is headed from Jerusalem to Damascus
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.700]   to arrest and imprison Jesus followers
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.820]   who escaped Jerusalem and are now sharing
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.940]   this poisonous message about Jesus.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.960]   This must be stopped.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:03.720]   Let's pick up the story in Acts chapter nine.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.900]   Beginning at the beginning of the chapter.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.700]   Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.900]   against the Lord's disciples.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.720]   He went to the high priest and asked him for letters
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.340]   to the synagogues in Damascus
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.460]   so that if he found any there who belonged to the way,
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.380]   whether men or women,
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.540]   he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.140]   As Paul neared Damascus on his journey,
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.340]   suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.500]   He fell to the ground.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.700]   He heard a voice say to him, "Saul, Saul,
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.640]   "why do you persecute me?
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.460]   "Who are you, Lord?"
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.460]   Saul asked, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,"
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.500]   he replied.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.560]   "Now get up and go into the city
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.060]   "and you will be told what you must do."
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.300]   So Saul got up from the ground,
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:12.220]   but when he opened his eyes, he could see nothing.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.380]   So they led him by the hand into Damascus
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.060]   for three days.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.740]   He was blind.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.580]   He did not eat or drink anything.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:30.660]   Paul can see nothing,
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:36.540]   but he is beginning to see everything.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.980]   His mind is filled with the vision of what he saw,
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.820]   and it was the same vision Stephen saw.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.980]   Jesus is now in a place of highest honor
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.580]   with God in heaven.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.580]   That glorious vision blinded Saul physically,
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.540]   but began to open his spiritual eyes.
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.660]   "You are persecuting me, Paul."
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.980]   Paul is stunned.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.980]   He has been doing God's will,
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.220]   but Jesus is telling him that he, Paul,
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.100]   is totally, absolutely wrong.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:26.440]   Everything Paul believes about Messiah is wrong.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.580]   Paul's passion to purify the people of God
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.100]   is causing him to go against God.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.980]   In an instant, it dawns on Paul,
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:42.980]   "I am torturing God's very own son."
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:49.660]   Last Sunday, Andrew talked about persecution.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.580]   When people attack us because of our faith in Jesus,
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.380]   he takes that real personally.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.860]   They're not just attacking us,
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.660]   they are attacking Jesus,
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.540]   and he's right there with us in our discomfort and pain.
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:15.120]   Jesus died for you and me,
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.280]   and he continues to suffer with us
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.580]   even in this pandemic.
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.660]   Well, back to our story.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:32.800]   What Stephen saw as he was dying,
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.300]   Paul saw in a flash of light,
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.300]   he saw Jesus, and Jesus spoke his name.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:47.100]   Jesus invited Paul in the worst trauma of his life
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.500]   to rethink his core beliefs
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.900]   and his prejudices about Jesus.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:15:00.820]   Paul now realizes Stephen didn't deserve to die.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:07.420]   Paul had helped to execute an innocent man.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.900]   What an awful thing.
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.060]   Peter and John and the other leaders that Paul hated,
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.900]   they are right, he is wrong.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.060]   The people in Damascus he is ready to arrest.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.020]   They are innocent, and he, Paul, is guilty.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.600]   Paul should be arrested,
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.620]   not the Jesus followers in Damascus.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.360]   This is like finding out all at once
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   that your politics is wrong,
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.360]   your theology is screwed up and needs a total makeover,
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:51.440]   and that your current career is like a total disaster.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.920]   You're not just a failure.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.760]   You are abusing people
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.920]   and dishonoring the God you serve.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:07.320]   Well, let's pick up the story in Damascus.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.840]   Paul is blind.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.720]   He's very hungry and very thirsty.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.240]   Three days.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.240]   God has asked a man named Ananias to go see Paul.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.680]   Acts 9, 13, I'm reading from the message.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.600]   Ananias protested, naturally,
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.040]   "Master, you can't be serious.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.740]   "Everybody's talking about this man
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.080]   "and the terrible things he's been doing.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.960]   "His reign of terror against your people in Jerusalem,
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.700]   "and now he's shown up here with papers
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.620]   "from the chief priest that give him a license
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.640]   "to do the very same thing to us in Damascus."
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.640]   But the master said, "Don't argue, Ananias, go.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.860]   "I have picked Paul as my personal representative
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.760]   "to Gentiles and kings and Jews,
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.180]   "and now I'm about to show him what he's in for,
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:16.180]   "the hard suffering that goes with this job."
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:21.380]   So Ananias went, found the house,
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:26.380]   placed his hands on blind Saul and said,
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.380]   "Brother Saul, the master sent me,
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.040]   "the same Jesus you saw on your way here.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.880]   "He sent me so you could see again
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.940]   "and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.740]   No sooner were the words out of his mouth
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.020]   than something like scales fell from Saul's eyes.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.380]   He could see again.
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.020]   He got to his feet.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:59.020]   He was baptized and sat down with them for a hearty meal.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:05.900]   Well, perhaps you know the rest of the story.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.540]   Paul, the zealous persecutor of Jesus' followers,
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.140]   became a passionate Jesus promoter and church planter.
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:18.060]   His trauma led to an incredible transformation
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.560]   of Paul's life and career.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:26.740]   You know trauma does this to people today.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.900]   Some years back, before I met my wife, Chris,
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.900]   before she was a Christian,
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.100]   her mom's family was traumatized
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.360]   by a tragic bus accident right here in Hong Kong.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.820]   Her mom's coat caught in the door of the bus
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.180]   as she was getting off,
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.540]   and she was dragged under the bus.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.760]   The bus ran over her leg.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.420]   Doctors weren't sure Chris's mom would live,
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.120]   and if she did, she would certainly lose her leg.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.020]   Traumatized by the likelihood
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.600]   that her mom would never perhaps walk again,
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.080]   Chris cried out to Jesus,
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.340]   "I don't believe in you, Jesus,
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:17.180]   "but if you heal my mother, I'll follow you."
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.960]   After two years in the hospital,
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.900]   11 surgeries and skin transplants,
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.040]   Chris's mom walked out of the hospital,
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.800]   and Chris became a follower of Jesus.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.460]   I'm hugely glad that Chris experienced
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.300]   spiritual change through trauma,
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.520]   because otherwise, she wouldn't be my wife.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:49.180]   We won't discuss the occasional trauma
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.280]   she still experiences being married to me.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:58.780]   And you've been reading the stories
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.220]   in our January devotionals
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.580]   about how many of us Vine people
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.580]   have experienced deep spiritual change through trauma.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.860]   Whether we're Christians or not,
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.620]   this pandemic has caused many of us
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.980]   to ask big questions.
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.220]   Where is God in all this turmoil
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.940]   and confusion and suffering?
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.640]   Why doesn't a God of love step in
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.480]   to stop the pandemic?
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.300]   Our core beliefs have been challenged,
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.260]   sometimes shaken.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:38.020]   With church buildings closed,
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.740]   many Christians are asking fundamental questions.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.660]   What is the church?
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.660]   How does the church survive and thrive
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.580]   when we can't gather in a building?
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:54.440]   How will we do church differently after this pandemic?
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:00.100]   We may be asking even deeper questions
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.020]   about our relationships, our marriage,
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.180]   the family, about how we do our work,
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.860]   about schools and education,
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.760]   about how we run our businesses.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.420]   How can we manage our careers
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.140]   with everything so messed up?
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:20.020]   Some of us are probing even deeper,
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.540]   why am I even here?
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.060]   Why do I get up in the morning?
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.660]   Every day seems the same.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:33.780]   Why do I do what I do?
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.980]   What's it all about?
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.780]   After Paul met Jesus,
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.100]   he had to spend three years in the desert
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.140]   figuring out what this meant for him personally,
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.400]   for his understanding of the Hebrew Bible,
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.560]   what it meant for his life and career.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.880]   But Jesus was with Paul in that journey
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.640]   every step of the way
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.120]   through the presence and power of the Spirit.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.520]   Paul was not on his own.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.840]   Throughout his teaching and writing ministry,
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.540]   the presence and work of God's Spirit
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.900]   was always front and center,
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.780]   I should say, deep within Paul.
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:25.100]   Paul reflects back on this experience
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.540]   as some years later in one of his letters.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.540]   This is Galatians chapter one,
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.680]   starting with verse 13.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.480]   I'm reading again from the message.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.140]   I'm sure that you've heard the story of my earlier life
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.900]   when I lived in the Jewish way.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.880]   In those days, I went all out persecuting God's church.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.340]   I was systematically destroying it.
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.680]   I was so enthusiastic about the traditions of my ancestors
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.180]   that I advanced head and shoulders
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.680]   above my peers in my career.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.940]   Even then, God had designs on me.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.380]   Why, when I was still in my mother's womb,
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:10.380]   he chose and called me out of sheer generosity
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:16.100]   and now God has intervened and revealed his Son to me
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:22.260]   so that I might joyfully tell none Jews about him.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:29.140]   Paul's post-traumatic growth
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.580]   helped him understand God's purpose for his birth,
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.940]   his life, in a new way.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.620]   He was reading the same Hebrew Bible
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.580]   but seeing it in a totally different light.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.700]   He developed a new narrative,
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.660]   a new way of understanding his past,
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.540]   a new way of describing his way of life and career,
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.100]   a new way of teaching the scriptures
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.540]   he had learned to love when he was growing up as a boy.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:03.540]   Now, Paul saw everything in the light of Jesus,
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:09.340]   the Messiah, the Christ, who is now everything to Paul.
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:13.900]   And for Paul, there's an amazing future awaiting him.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:18.900]   He says, "For me to live is Christ and to die,"
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.840]   why, that's even better.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:27.640]   I believe God wants to bring deep spiritual change.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:32.000]   Spiritual change to you and to me,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   to us as a church during this pandemic.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.240]   It won't be the same as it was for Paul.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.720]   It's different for every person
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:47.720]   but God wants us to meet Jesus in a new way,
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.480]   to be filled with his spirit
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.480]   so that as we examine our core beliefs and values and habits,
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.120]   we will reconnect with God's purpose for our lives,
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.880]   for our families, for our careers,
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.760]   God's purpose for our educational systems and businesses,
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.760]   God's purpose for our city, for our nation.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.880]   If that happens, like Paul,
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.920]   we will never be the same again
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.080]   and we will bring change to many others around us.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.080]   We will bring change to our city and to our world.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.800]   Now, this won't happen in an instant.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.680]   It took Paul at least three years, indeed,
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.400]   the rest of his life to work out the full meaning
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.440]   of this profound spiritual change.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.440]   But this pandemic is the place for us to begin.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:56.000]   Everything has been turned upside down.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.800]   This is our Damascus road
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   and there are three simple but challenging steps
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.040]   we need to take.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:15.080]   First of all, we need to meet Jesus.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.080]   It begins for us, as it did for Paul,
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.740]   with a new encounter with Jesus and his spirit.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.520]   To fall in love with Jesus,
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:31.520]   invite him to change you deeply from the inside out
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.500]   and to keep on doing it.
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:41.760]   Our deepest pleasure begins and ends with Jesus.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:48.600]   Secondly, let's walk with Jesus to make our world better.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.880]   Invite Jesus to walk with you,
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.040]   to make you a force for good in your relationships,
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.200]   in your work, in your leisure time activities.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.240]   For me, recently, I've been singing the words
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.320]   of an African-American spiritual
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.180]   as I walk the streets in Hong Kong.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.520]   It was written by American slaves
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   who may have suffered deeper and longer trauma
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.600]   than any group of people in human history.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:30.440]   I want Jesus to walk with me, the spiritual goes.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.200]   Oh, I want Jesus to walk with me
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   all along my pilgrim journey.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:44.220]   I want you, Jesus, to walk with me.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.680]   Three, share the gift God's spirit has placed in you.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:00.280]   You are a gifted child of God.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.920]   You are endowed with a special talent
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.200]   and passion from God's spirit living in you.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.140]   There's no one like you.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:15.120]   Discover and use that gift from the spirit
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.520]   in new ways every day, every year.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.520]   Your greatest joy will come when your deepest passion
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:31.400]   connects with the greatest hunger of people around you.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:38.540]   You will truly feel God's pleasure.
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:44.100]   Now, friends, don't do this by yourself.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:49.340]   Do it with family members, with friends,
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.760]   with your community group.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.620]   If you want a mentor, a spiritual friend to walk with you,
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.000]   let us know.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.560]   We're here to help.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:06.720]   Now, this brings us to the end of this series
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.260]   on growing through stress and trauma,
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.680]   but it's just the beginning of a new
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.560]   and challenging chapter in your life.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:20.300]   Moving forward, we're going to keep on growing
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.860]   through this pandemic.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:27.900]   As Paul discovered with Jesus, the best is yet to come.
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:34.840]   Not always the easiest, but the best.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.440]   Well, I would like to invite you, if you would,
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.360]   to pray this prayer with me.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:50.360]   Jesus, I'm finding this pandemic really tough.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:58.760]   There's so much fear and confusion,
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.120]   so much conflict and suffering.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.980]   I'm asking hard questions about you, Jesus,
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:13.660]   about me, about my family, my career, about this city.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:19.660]   I want to meet you, Jesus, in a fresh way.
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:26.960]   I want to discover again why you placed me here.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:34.360]   I want to walk with you to bring positive change
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:39.500]   in my world, and I want to share by your spirit
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.880]   living in me.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.640]   I want to share the gift and passion.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.640]   You placed in me to bring joy and blessing
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.760]   to my family, my friends, my colleagues.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.640]   I want to feel your pleasure.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:03.120]   Help me find at least one person to guide and support me
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.040]   on this exciting journey.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:11.040]   I pray this, Jesus, in your name, amen.
