[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   and we pray in Jesus' name.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   - Amen. - Amen.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.120]   - Thank you, Jen.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.200]   And good afternoon, everybody.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.880]   Good afternoon, welcome back, Andrew, as well.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.640]   I hope you can see, you know,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.040]   you should be proud of your team, Andrew,
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.360]   'cause we've really been thriving in the past four months.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.680]   It's been really good.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.280]   I really wanna-- (audience laughing)
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.320]   We have, you know, but it's credit to you, too.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.680]   And we have an amazing team.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.320]   You know, I wanna honor the team
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.720]   that's been leading from the pulpit as well.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.360]   It's such an honor to work with such an amazing
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.480]   group of people.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.120]   And for us to be able to hear a variety of, you know,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.200]   perspectives and voices on different topics
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.880]   around the Bible, I think it's been really, really good.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.000]   So yeah, shout out to the worship team as well.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.440]   You know, every time they come together and they plan,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.200]   you know, there's a reason why the service flows together.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.640]   It's because thought and preparation and prayer
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.880]   has been put into it.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.440]   And so yeah, it's been a good journey.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.640]   And we've journeyed through forgiveness, too,
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.360]   over the past few months, over the past couple of weeks.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.560]   And today, like Jennifer said, we're wrapping up the series.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.600]   And even though, you know, the topic of forgiveness
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200]   as a sermon series ends today,
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.600]   the journey of forgiveness has to continue.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.240]   And so the message that I'm bringing today
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.320]   has been sitting on my heart for the past couple of weeks.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.800]   I've been fasting and praying up to today for this message.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.240]   And so before we start, I hope that we can pray again
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.680]   and that you can pray for me as I bring God's word
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.880]   and open up scripture together.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.880]   So let's pray again.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.160]   Yeah, Jesus, just thank you for this journey
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.840]   that you've had us on and that you'll continue
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.880]   to lead us into, Jesus.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.640]   And I pray that as we open up your word today,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.280]   that yeah, it would just be truth.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.480]   It would just be encouraging and challenging
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.320]   and yeah, lead us closer to you, Lord.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.400]   We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.880]   All right, got a question for you before we get going.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.640]   What is the worst date that you've ever been on?
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.400]   The worst date you've ever been on, okay?
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.040]   Maybe some of you are on a date right now
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.960]   and you're like, the worst date is when the person I'm with
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.120]   brought me to church instead of to brunch
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.200]   or to high tea or something.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.760]   Okay, that was what you were expecting.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.640]   You ended up here instead, okay?
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.920]   I hope it's okay, all right?
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.840]   I'm gonna share one of my experiences with you, okay?
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.800]   Mind you, this was about 20 something years ago now, okay?
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.080]   I was a freshman, a fresher at university in London, okay?
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.920]   And so, you know, I was trying to get to know people,
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.600]   new city, new school.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.120]   I decided to sign up for a psychology class.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.360]   Now, I decided to sign up for psychology
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.360]   because people told me a lot of girls do psychology, okay?
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.320]   At UCL, so I thought, don't judge me, okay?
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.200]   I was 18 years old, okay?
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.040]   Some of you come here because of the girls, okay?
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.160]   So, all right, so.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.560]   Okay, so. (laughs)
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.160]   I'm not looking this way, okay?
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.640]   (audience laughs)
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.880]   I joined the class, okay, and I got anything I learned,
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.360]   but the girl that sits next to me, she's nice, okay?
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.760]   And so, and we start talking, and then, okay,
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.080]   I thought, you know, okay, we're getting along.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.960]   Maybe I'll ask her out and see what she says.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.000]   So, one day after lecture, I say,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.360]   tomorrow, you know, after psychology,
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.000]   do you wanna go out for lunch together?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.440]   And she says, yes, okay.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.320]   I say, good, so far, so good.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.440]   I tell her, well, let's go to Wagamama's.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.560]   And she agrees, okay, now, for those of you
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.880]   who don't know what Wagamama's is,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.080]   it's a restaurant chain in London, okay?
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.760]   It's fusion food, okay, where they take Japanese food
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.000]   and make it disgusting, okay?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.300]   That's sort of what Wagamama's does, okay?
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.040]   Lot of Londoners don't like it, but I love it, okay?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.160]   I'll tell you why in a minute.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.360]   So, lunch date comes along, we're eating,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   conversing, getting along, you know, chatting.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.760]   Oh, you're from Hong Kong, it's fun, isn't it?
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.480]   Yeah, all that kind of stuff, you know,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.800]   and having a good time, okay?
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.360]   And, you know, the meal comes to an end,
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.320]   and it's time to pay the bill.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.720]   Now, being the gentleman that I am, right,
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.240]   and the one who initiated the date,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.100]   I thought it was only appropriate that I pay for the meal.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.120]   But it was also because I had a secret weapon, right?
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.680]   You see, I had coupons, all right?
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.000]   A few weeks before this, all right,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.560]   I found on the internet, buy one, get one free, okay,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.800]   at Wagamama's, right?
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.260]   It was just right there on the website.
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.980]   So, I, like, printed out, like, 50 of these things, okay?
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.400]   It was, like, went to the library, logged in, you know,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.040]   printed off 50 of these Wagamama coupons,
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.480]   I had a little stack of them, okay?
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.000]   It was amazing, all right?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.680]   I had them in my backpack, ready to use at any time, right?
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.600]   So, the bill comes along, it's like, I got this.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.980]   And she seems impressed until I say, I got a coupon.
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.880]   It's buy one, get one free, right?
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.960]   And I pull out my stack of coupons.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.040]   In my mind, I thought this girl was gonna be like,
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.920]   oh my goodness, look at this frugal Chinese man, right?
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.620]   Handsome and frugal, right, boyfriend material, right?
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.900]   But instead, the look on her face was one of,
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.100]   I wouldn't say disgust, but it was pretty close to that,
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.220]   okay, and she didn't have to say it out loud,
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.620]   but the expression she had told me, like,
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.660]   oh my gosh, this guy is so cheap, okay, like,
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.260]   he took me to Wagamama's on a two for,
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.060]   it's not expensive in the first place, okay,
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.940]   on a two for one at Wagamama's, right?
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.540]   Now, needless to say, there was no second date, okay,
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.360]   but I kept eating at Wagamama's
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.500]   and two of those coupons ran out and it was great, right?
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.560]   And I wish I could have said I've changed since then,
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.440]   but not really, okay, I'm still cheap, all right?
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.720]   For example, the first wedding anniversary,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.080]   my wife and I are celebrating 15 years
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.800]   in December of being married, okay, so yeah.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.160]   But true story, on our first wedding anniversary,
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.960]   I'd planned this, okay, I was saving up
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.040]   all the loose change I had for the whole year.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.760]   So I had this little, like, bucket of loose change,
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.060]   and I was gonna use that to pay for dinner
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.700]   on our first wedding anniversary, right?
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.980]   So that in itself was already kind of cheap, okay?
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.420]   So I go to the bank and I say, okay,
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.740]   I wanna cash this in, I wanna make it into cash.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.460]   And they said, oh, there's a 2% service charge for that.
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.400]   It's like, 2%, I'm not gonna pay that, okay?
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.820]   So in the end, what I ended up doing,
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.060]   I took the bucket, it was like a bucket literally of coins,
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.780]   and I took it along with me to our dinner date
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.140]   on our first anniversary, excuse me,
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.540]   and I paid for dinner using coins, okay?
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.880]   I'm not joking, okay, it was like a $1,000 dinner
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.560]   in fives, twos, and ones.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.520]   I had to count them out after the meal, okay?
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   Brittany was, she had run away by the end of the meal,
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.800]   so embarrassed, okay, I didn't care, I don't care, okay?
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.500]   It paid for the meal, all right?
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.620]   So, yeah, that's me, okay?
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.500]   Now you'll see in a minute
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.400]   why I'm sharing these stories with you.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.520]   But over the past few weeks, like I said,
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.160]   we've been taking a deep dive
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.720]   into this topic of forgiveness.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.440]   And I hope it's been helpful, right?
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.760]   I hope it's given you a better understanding
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.280]   of what God's heart is when it comes to forgiveness,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.760]   because we've really needed it.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.740]   I shared it in the beginning of the series as well.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.940]   I felt that this was a heart cry of the church, right?
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.000]   And I wanna show you something.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.400]   So this bowl right here, okay,
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.560]   this is full of the prayer requests
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.340]   that we wrote out during Converse
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.520]   at the beginning of this year, right?
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.000]   All of these have to do with forgiving others,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.100]   forgiving ourselves, forgiving lots of different things,
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.080]   all on our struggles for forgiveness.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.680]   And there's even more, hundreds of them written out,
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.580]   your heart poured out on this topic of forgiveness.
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.120]   But as I was thinking about this,
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.100]   and I was thinking about us,
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.320]   and I was thinking about this series,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.120]   I began to realize that actually there might be some pitfalls
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.200]   in focusing on forgiveness so much, right?
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.720]   In all this talk of needing about to embrace forgiveness
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.640]   because it's what God has done for us, right?
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.080]   In the realization that yes,
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.960]   Jesus has taken away our guilt and our shame,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.400]   he holds nothing against us.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.180]   One of the risks is that forgiveness starts becoming
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.680]   something we take for granted, right?
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.840]   Our mindset becomes like,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.960]   hey, since forgiveness is always there,
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.360]   then I've just accessed it when I need it, all right?
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.160]   So we can help ourselves to it whenever we want, right?
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.480]   I'm gonna live my life, do whatever I want,
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.840]   and just ask for God's forgiveness later
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.240]   because it's been promised to me.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.460]   And then on the other side of that,
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.240]   we start even to maybe apply that
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.600]   to the way we relate to each other, right?
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.520]   When it comes to forgiving each other,
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.280]   we start using forgiveness like a weapon, right?
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.220]   We hurt each other, but instead of doing the hard work
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.700]   of confessing and repenting and actually changing ourselves,
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.880]   we develop the mindset of, well, you know,
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.840]   you have to forgive me because Pastor Ellison
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.800]   and Pastor Jen and all these people have been saying so.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.720]   Or I can hear right now, maybe you and your spouse,
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.120]   you and your partner having an argument.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.700]   You know you're wrong, you know you've messed up,
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.520]   but instead of owning up to your mistakes,
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.360]   outcomes in your mouth,
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.060]   or haven't you been listening to the sermons?
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.240]   Why don't you just forgive me?
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.040]   All right, listen, if that's what we've come away with
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.280]   at the end of the series,
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.780]   then I think we've got the wrong end of the stick.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.640]   In other words, if we come away from the series
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.960]   thinking forgiveness is something that we can do cheaply,
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.040]   just like coupons or coins, all right,
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.240]   we've wasted our time.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.440]   Because forgiveness cannot be cheap.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.000]   And forgiveness is not cheap because it was God's idea.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.680]   It's this great and amazing gift to us.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.580]   So we really have to treat it as something that's precious.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.260]   Right, in the beginning of this series,
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.200]   we said also that forgiveness is going to be a journey.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.680]   Right, we're gonna learn how to forgive
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.780]   at the end of this series.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.520]   And again, I feel like we've missed something.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.920]   I feel like I missed something.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.480]   Because I've realized the journey
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.600]   isn't really learning how to forgive.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.560]   Right, you can actually learn how to forgive
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.580]   in lots of different ways.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.960]   Right, in like the scientific world,
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   if you wanna use that word,
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.780]   forgiveness is something that's good for you physiologically.
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.600]   Right, so there's health benefits,
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.000]   you embrace forgiveness, right,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.480]   the lowest stress and anxiety in your life,
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.100]   all those good health benefits
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.240]   that forgiveness can give you.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.920]   Right, Buddhism teaches forgiveness.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.760]   Right, Buddhism teaches that forgiveness
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.360]   is the way to reach inner peace.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.960]   Right, so if you want inner peace,
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.440]   you have to embrace forgiveness.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.360]   Right, Hinduism says forgiveness,
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.800]   you should practice forgiveness for the sake of karma.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.740]   So in the next life,
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.640]   you don't wanna come back as something ridiculous
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.080]   and you practice forgiveness so you can have good karma,
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.840]   right, and eventually reaching
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   the heights of self-realization.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.340]   Right, in Islam, the Quran teaches forgiveness
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.960]   as one of the virtues that Allah is impressed with.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.020]   So the more you forgive,
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.400]   the more riches you store up for the next life in heaven.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.020]   So the goal cannot simply be good at forgiving.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.380]   There's so many routes we can take to be forgiving.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.300]   No, the goal is this.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.300]   Our goal in life is to become more and more like Jesus.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.860]   Our goal is to learn what it means
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.100]   to enter through the small and narrow gates
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.020]   that leads to life.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.940]   Our goal is to discover that Jesus is the way,
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.060]   the truth, and the life,
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.580]   that no one comes to the Father except through him.
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.580]   And what I've realized is it's only
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.780]   when we learn to be like Jesus
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.860]   that we can truly live out and practice forgiveness
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.960]   as God intended it to be.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.420]   If we just learn how to forgive
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.300]   without learning how to be like Jesus,
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.180]   then we've missed the point.
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.860]   So we're gonna open up Scripture,
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.980]   and the passage we're gonna look at today
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.780]   will remind us of this ultimate goal in our life,
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.740]   and it will challenge us to follow it.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.740]   Matthew 16, verses 24 to 26, Jesus says this.
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.340]   Jesus said to his disciples,
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.820]   "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.860]   "and take up their cross and follow me.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.720]   "For whoever wants to save their life will lose it,
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.620]   "but whoever loses their life for me will find it.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.460]   "What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.260]   "yet forfeit their soul?
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.860]   "Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?"
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:12.140]   We like to talk about the benefits of following Jesus,
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.340]   and it's good, and it's great,
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.340]   and forgiveness is one of those great benefits that we get
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.860]   when we give our lives to the Lord.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.820]   Once we accept Jesus as our savior,
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.140]   we believe that our sins are forgiven
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.300]   and that we are what is called justified.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.380]   The basic idea of being justified means
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.860]   that because of God's forgiveness,
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.020]   our sin is no longer on record.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.020]   He blots it out, the debt of sin has been paid,
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.100]   which means that when God looks at us,
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.460]   he doesn't see sin, instead what he sees
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.400]   is one who is clean and pure.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.400]   You can think of it as someone as if,
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.300]   just as if they had never sinned
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.800]   because of what Jesus has done for us.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.400]   But notice though, this is not totally free.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.480]   Of course it's free for you and me,
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.160]   but it came at the great cost of Jesus' life.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.000]   And because it came at a great cost,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.880]   like I've been saying, we cannot treat it cheaply.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.680]   We cannot treat it with contempt.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.080]   Because if we do this with cheapened forgiveness,
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.280]   you know, you're like me,
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.760]   you like seeking for coins and coupons at Wagamama's, right?
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.120]   We just use it whenever we need.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.440]   And we have to realize that forgiveness is free for everyone
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.360]   only because Jesus paid the price in the first place.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.880]   Right, the price we could not pay for ourselves.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.260]   Now, it is available to all,
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.960]   but what we're looking at today
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.520]   is that there are certain conditions God gives us
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.520]   in order to properly embrace this free gift and his benefits.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.120]   The point of forgiveness is not just to comfort you,
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.560]   to make you feel better,
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.320]   for you to go back and do the same thing over and over again.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.960]   Forgiveness from God is meant to change you,
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.520]   to mold you, to encourage you to become more like him.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.360]   In other words, if you really want to know
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.240]   the benefits of forgiveness,
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.520]   you must become a disciple of Jesus.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.800]   And when it comes to the journey of discipleship,
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.440]   when it comes to being like Jesus,
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.720]   it comes with a cost, it comes with a change to your life.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.640]   Right, this makes sense.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.080]   This only makes, because if not,
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.520]   anyone else, anyone could call themselves a Christian,
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.120]   right, and just keep living however you want,
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.440]   and just keep asking for God's forgiveness.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.320]   But don't you see again,
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.280]   that's cheapening what forgiveness is.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.920]   If you want to call yourself a Christian,
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.840]   if you want to truly profess
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.720]   that you are following Jesus with your life,
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.200]   it's going to come at a cost to us as well.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.560]   And there are things you're gonna have to be changed
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.200]   in your life in order to live as a disciple of Jesus.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.600]   So what does it cost for us to follow Jesus?
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.800]   Well, let's go back to the passage
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.960]   and find out what it tells us.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.520]   Verse 24, Jesus starts by saying this.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.080]   If anyone would come after me,
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.280]   anyone, this message is for anyone.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.200]   Anyone means anyone, right?
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.680]   This means you, this means me, this one, anyone,
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.840]   who's listening to this right now, anyone.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.840]   It's an open invitation to all people
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.080]   because God wants everybody to follow him.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.440]   But also notice the word if.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.760]   If anybody.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.360]   If means this is a choice.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.040]   If you want to do this, this is what it's gonna take.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.400]   Jesus always gives us a choice, right?
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.520]   He's not gonna drag you, kicking and screaming.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.720]   That's not free will, that's not free choice,
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.160]   that's not real love.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.240]   He's asking us to make a decision.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.160]   If we want to come after him,
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.960]   these are the things that we're gonna have to do.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.160]   And he's about to explain there are some requirements, right?
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.840]   We're gonna deep dive deep into the definition
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.960]   of what it means to follow Jesus.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.840]   And I'll tell you right now, right,
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.360]   it's not just coming to Sunday service.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.240]   It's more than just giving an offering or a tithe.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.720]   It's more than just volunteering
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.440]   or being a part of a community group,
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.640]   as great as those things are.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.760]   So the one serious question we have to ask ourselves,
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.480]   maybe the most serious question you'll ever ask yourself
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.160]   in your life is this.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.320]   Do you want to go after Jesus?
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.640]   Do you want to be a disciple of the Lord?
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.160]   Because if you say yes,
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.640]   following Jesus is gonna drastically change your life.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.080]   If you say yes, I'm about to teach us
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.920]   what we need in order to follow him.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.720]   Or Jesus is about to teach us.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.160]   So he says this, firstly, we must deny ourselves,
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.880]   deny himself, deny herself.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.640]   The first step of deciding to follow Jesus
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.360]   is to deny yourself.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.680]   Now, what does this mean?
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.080]   Right, it's more than just self-control.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.440]   It's more than just, ooh, I'm not gonna have
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.600]   that last piece of cake that's on the table, right?
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.840]   That's not really what it means
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.480]   when it calls denying yourself.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.240]   No, denying yourself is talking about the full
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.240]   and total surrender of your entire life into Jesus' hands.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.040]   Okay, hang on a sec, 'cause we live in a day,
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.280]   think about this for a sec, okay?
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.280]   We live in a day and age where the prevailing mindset
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.080]   seems to be you can and you should have whatever you want.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.400]   This world tells us to take control of your life.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.600]   You can do whatever you want,
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.880]   you just have to take control of your destiny.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.720]   It's up to you, follow your heart, do all that stuff.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   And there's this belief out there that teaches us
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.360]   that we are so in control of our lives
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.760]   that you can truly have anything you want can be yours
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.200]   if you could only manifest it.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.640]   Right, you guys heard about manifesting?
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.600]   Right, this idea of making everything you want
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.200]   and to feel and experience into a reality for yourself.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.280]   And you can do this apparently through your thoughts,
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.960]   actions, beliefs, and emotions.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   In other words, the world teaches us,
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.520]   deny yourself nothing.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.000]   But if it makes you feel good,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.080]   if you think that's what's good for you,
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.920]   go and do whatever you want to do.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.320]   Listen, okay?
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.360]   This sounds good, it sounds attractive.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.360]   Do whatever you want, have whatever you want,
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.240]   deny yourself no pleasures, all right?
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.800]   I admit it does sound good.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.560]   Right, some preachers out there might even say,
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.440]   you know, this is the life God wants for you.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.160]   Bliss, happiness, all those things, right?
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.320]   Blessings all the time.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.200]   But church, this is a lie.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.400]   Right, think about it for a minute.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.320]   If life was all about making yourself happy,
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.800]   then why would we need God at all?
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.040]   If life was just about pleasing yourself
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.200]   and you could just manifest everything that you want,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.160]   we wouldn't need God, you'd need God.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.280]   So denying yourself is really about discovering
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.840]   the true purpose in your life.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.120]   Right, and your purpose is not for the pleasure of yourself.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.680]   Your purpose in life is not to live
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.840]   a happy, comfortable life,
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.440]   just to die peacefully in your sleep.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.160]   Your purpose in life is not to climb the corporate ladder
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   and get to the highest ranks of your profession.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.680]   Your purpose in life is not to find a life partner
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.000]   and spend the rest of your life with.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.600]   No, your purpose in life,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.040]   your only purpose in life is to follow Jesus
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.960]   by being an image bearer of God.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.600]   Your purpose in life, church,
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.720]   no matter what the world says,
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.400]   is to worship Jesus with all your heart,
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.640]   mind, and strength,
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.080]   and to be an example of his love to others.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.520]   Above everything else,
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.400]   this has to be your ultimate goal in life.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.640]   And for you and I to be able to do that,
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.360]   we have to deny ourselves.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.560]   We have to be willing to say,
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.600]   "Everything else in my life is gonna take a back seat,
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   "and I'm gonna be fully dedicated to being more like Jesus."
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.200]   Now, I know this sounds extreme.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.040]   It sounds foolish.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.600]   It sounds almost as though Jesus
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.720]   is trying to kill all our personalities, right?
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.240]   Make everyone act in the same way.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.080]   It sounds as though Jesus is trying to get rid
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.200]   of everything that's enjoyable in your life,
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.840]   forced you to be grumpy and miserable all the time.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.240]   It sounds a bit like that, I know, right?
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.680]   It sounds a bit like Jesus saying,
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.240]   "Don't have fun, don't enjoy your life.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.880]   "Just do what I tell you to do."
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.480]   But that couldn't be further from the truth.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.600]   There's a story, famous story in the Bible
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.000]   of the rich young ruler, right?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.200]   This is a rich young ruler,
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.680]   a person who has everything he has in the worldly sense.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.520]   And he encounters Jesus,
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.680]   and he's actually interested in following Jesus.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.880]   But when Jesus challenges him to deny himself
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.600]   of his significant wealth and possessions
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.320]   so that he could follow him, he couldn't do it.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.520]   And the Bible, Scripture tells us he walked away
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.320]   grieved in his heart,
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.040]   even though he was still holding on
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.960]   to everything that he ever wanted.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.640]   On the other hand, when Zacchaeus,
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.920]   also a wealthy man, who was interested in following Jesus,
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.400]   when he encounters Jesus, he realizes his sin,
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.840]   and he willingly gives up and denies himself his wealth,
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.200]   even paying back four times as much
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.320]   that he had taken from other people.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.120]   And in his case, Jesus declares,
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.200]   "Salvation has come to this house today."
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.560]   The one who was willing to deny himself
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.680]   discovered the meaning of life.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.640]   The one who was not willing to deny himself
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.720]   walked away from the giver of life.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.400]   So church, let me remind us today,
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.600]   denying yourself, surrendering fully
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.160]   to anything Jesus wants you to do
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.320]   is the first step we have to take
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.680]   in the life that you were meant to live,
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.440]   the life of following Jesus.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.960]   But then how do we do it?
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.240]   How do we do this thing to deny ourselves?
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.160]   It's not just a matter of strong will and self-discipline.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.880]   It's gonna take more than that.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.360]   We can achieve a lot of things
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.680]   through strong will and discipline.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.560]   I've done two marathons and two trail walkers
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.400]   with zero training, literally, I'm not joking,
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.680]   based only on my will.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.520]   I kept going.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.880]   It took me like five and a half hours
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.760]   to finish the first marathon.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.920]   I was limping across the finish line.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.320]   I just kept myself, just keep going.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.520]   Don't get on that bus, just keep going, okay?
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.480]   No training, though.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.320]   I don't recommend it.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.280]   I was dead the next day, okay?
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.560]   But that's not the tactic, right?
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.040]   This isn't just like grit your teeth
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.920]   and I'm gonna deny myself and keep going, keep going.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.320]   It actually takes even more than that.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:18.440]   This is not a call to self-discipline, church.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.360]   This is a call to death.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.560]   Because Jesus says the next step is to pick up the cross.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.920]   Pick up your cross.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.800]   Now again, the idea of picking up your cross,
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   it's sort of a teaching that's been cheapened
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.120]   by the world's thinking.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.080]   When we hear this phrase, right, it's sort of cutesy.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.600]   Like, you know, I'm gonna pick up my cross
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.520]   like a little bird and I have to bear.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.840]   Okay, for example, you know, the gout in my toe.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.280]   You know, every time I have a beer, the gout flares up.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.720]   You know, so, you know, my cross to bear
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.240]   is this gout in my toe.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.880]   Or maybe it's an annoying coworker.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.720]   He's like, you know, I have to work
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.040]   next to Philip Choi every day.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.840]   You know, so like, picking up my cross
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.560]   is having to work next to Philip all the time, okay?
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.160]   But it's not that, okay?
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.440]   The cross is more than just an annoyance.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.840]   The cross was an instrument of death.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.000]   So picking up your cross is not just,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.280]   it's not just, you know, annoyance you have to deal with.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.320]   Picking up your cross means denying yourself
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.320]   to the point where we think all of our earthly passions,
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.840]   our sinful desires, our past life
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.800]   is crucified and put to death.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.920]   Taking up your cross means not only to deny yourself,
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.880]   but it means to die to yourself.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.040]   Bonhoeffer, in his book, "The Cost of Discipleship,"
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.320]   I recommend all of us read it, says it this way.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.240]   When Christ calls a man or woman,
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.600]   he bids him to come and die.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.720]   You see, if we just stopped at denying ourselves, right?
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.440]   That stuff is still sort of there,
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.680]   like lurking in the background, right?
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.800]   And the danger is there's always a risk
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.920]   of us running back to it, right?
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.280]   Because as messed up as it is,
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.760]   there's a sort of a safety that we feel
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.280]   when we hide in sin, right?
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.840]   I know it's messed up, but we feel that, you know?
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.800]   And so we can't just be denying it
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.960]   and leaving that stuff there.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.840]   Scripture doesn't just tell us to resist sin.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.240]   That's just the first step.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.560]   Scripture tells us to put the sin
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.240]   in our old lives to death.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.760]   Time and time again, it reminds us of this.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.960]   Galatians 5:24, "Those who belong to Jesus Christ
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.800]   "have been," what?
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.480]   "Crucified," right?
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.360]   "The flesh with its passions and its desires."
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.760]   Romans 6:11, "In the same way, count yourselves," listen,
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.680]   "dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus."
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.000]   Matthew 5, Jesus himself,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.080]   "If your right eye causes you to stumble,
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.520]   "gouge it out and," do what?
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.760]   "Throw it away.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.480]   "If your right hand causes you to stumble,
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.880]   "cut it off and throw it away."
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.320]   2 Corinthians 5, "So then, if anyone in Christ,
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.560]   "he is a new creation, what is old has passed away."
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.760]   Look, what is new has come.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.640]   You get the point?
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.920]   Without dying to ourselves, there is always the risk
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   of going back and doing things according to our own flesh,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.360]   to our own agenda.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.520]   We're gonna want to say no when God says yes.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.200]   We're going to want to stop when God says go.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   We're gonna say I'm not ready when God says,
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.240]   "I need you to do this for me."
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.520]   And the attachments we have to the things of this world
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.120]   will try and tie us down and stop us
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.840]   from living a life with Jesus.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.640]   See, the point is not for Jesus to give you
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.560]   a better version of your life now.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.120]   What Jesus is offering when we come and follow him
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.000]   is a brand new life, a whole new life.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.960]   And in order for you to have a new life,
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.120]   your old life has to die.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.240]   This is why we call coming to Christ to be born again.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.680]   This is why the Bible tells us that we are buried within
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.040]   by baptism into what?
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.880]   Death, in order that just as Christ was risen from the dead
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.920]   for the glory of the Father,
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.440]   we too might walk in newness of life, Romans 6, 4.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:09.520]   Does your heart resonate with this, brothers and sisters?
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.000]   Is your desire to know Jesus, even in his death,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   and going to the cross your number one priority in life?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.880]   Are you willing not only to deny,
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.800]   but to die and throw away your old life
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.240]   so that you may know and follow Jesus?
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.440]   And I know I'm repeating myself,
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.880]   and it's beginning to sound a bit radical and extreme.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.240]   And even as I was preparing for this,
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.960]   I was, "Allison, you know, it's not that serious.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.080]   "You gotta chill with this stuff."
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.760]   But it's actually not that radical.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.000]   This is the norm.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.920]   This is what Jesus expects for us as followers of him.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.080]   Can we be like Paul and proclaim,
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.640]   "I resolve to know nothing
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.760]   "except Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.120]   Without dying to our old life,
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   we will never be able to embrace the new life offered to us,
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   a life where Jesus now says, "Come and follow me."
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:24.720]   This now becomes our only purpose in life, to follow Jesus.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:29.800]   Not chasing whatever feels good, not satisfying our flesh,
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.360]   but our aim after old life has been crucified.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.520]   We're not left aimless and pointless
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.160]   wandering around in this world.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.400]   Once our old life has been crucified,
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.920]   we can wholeheartedly, single-mindedly
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.640]   live our new life of following Jesus.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.600]   This is what discipleship means.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.560]   This is what we mean when we talk
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.400]   about growing big people here at the Vine,
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.560]   people who have denied their old lives to the point of death
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.560]   so that they can follow Jesus with nothing holding them back.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.280]   This is gonna be the cost, church.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.480]   This is the reaction, this is the decision
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.080]   that Jesus is seeking when he calls us to follow him.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.720]   And if we really want to experience
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.360]   his forgiveness over our lives,
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.040]   then this is what's required of us,
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:21.040]   to deny yourself, to pick up your cross, and to follow him.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.200]   So let me ask this again.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.080]   Do we really want to do this?
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.680]   Do we want to follow Jesus?
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.200]   Because there is a cost.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.840]   There are things that are gonna have to change in our lives.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.320]   A life with Jesus will mean discipline.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.600]   It is gonna mean denying yourself to the point of death,
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.120]   putting your old sin to life, putting your old life to death.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.600]   It might mean suffering for the Lord.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.200]   It might mean the risk of persecution.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:59.720]   It might mean being misunderstood by people around you.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.680]   It might mean being whole, it will mean
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.880]   being wholeheartedly obedient to him and him alone.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.360]   It's going to mean walking by faith and not by sight.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.080]   It's going to mean loving your neighbors
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.280]   as you've loved yourself.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.880]   It's going to mean loving your enemies even.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.240]   It's going to mean standing up for justice.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.760]   It's gonna mean loving those others have deemed as sinners.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.720]   It's gonna require sacrificial giving.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.680]   It means looking after the widows and the orphans.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.240]   It means going down the narrow, more difficult road.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.240]   It means dropping everything as the disciples did
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.720]   at the sound of his voice.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.800]   It's gonna mean putting him above all else.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.160]   It's gonna mean meditating and spending time
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.000]   marinating in God's word.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.360]   It's gonna mean thinking about things that are pure,
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.960]   things that are noble, things that are true.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.800]   It means committing yourself to the church,
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.240]   the body of Christ, serving him in this way.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.320]   It's gonna mean forgiving others as Jesus has forgiven you.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.400]   It's gonna mean loving your wife
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.040]   as Christ has loved the church.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.720]   It's gonna mean praying for your husband daily.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.520]   It's gonna mean teaching your children
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.440]   in the way that they should go.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.400]   It comes at a great sacrifice to us,
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.280]   a great cost to us, it has to.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.440]   But it will also mean this.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.520]   It means freedom from sin and darkness.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.960]   It means joy, true joy in your life.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.600]   It's gonna mean being surrounded by a community
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.280]   that truly loves you.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.400]   It's going to mean a life full of the power
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.200]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.800]   It's gonna mean seeing miracles, signs and wonders,
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.360]   things that only God can do.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.360]   It means being filled with wonder and worship.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.960]   Every time you look up at the night sky,
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.120]   you can think to yourself, what an amazing God I serve.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.680]   Look at the God who made the universe
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.720]   and he loves me as well.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:04.560]   It's going to mean a life full of purpose and direction.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.120]   It's going to mean a life that's not governed by fear,
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.120]   but directed by God's love.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.560]   It will mean a life that's free from shame and guilt.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.720]   It's going to mean enjoying God's blessings
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.560]   whenever he chooses to bless us with those.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:24.160]   It's gonna mean whole, healthy families and societies.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.040]   It's going to mean discovering the true purpose
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.480]   of what your life is on this earth.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:34.520]   It means Jesus becoming the one
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.880]   and only significance for your life.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.960]   And he is the only thing that is worth living for.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.800]   But this is a choice.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.480]   Like I said at the beginning, it's a question of if.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.000]   Which is why Jesus also gives us
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.600]   some very clear consequences of what life might turn out like
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.040]   if we don't choose to follow him.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:04.480]   He says this, "For whoever would save his life will lose it.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.960]   "But whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.240]   What Jesus is trying to say is this.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.200]   The more you try to control your own life,
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.440]   the more you try to live life on your own terms,
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.640]   the more you refuse to deal with the sin
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.040]   and darkness that's in your life,
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.400]   the more you hold on to vengeance and retribution,
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.320]   the more you try to save yourself and be your own savior,
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.280]   you will lose your life.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.960]   And I know, I was trying to come up
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.920]   with a cute illustration for this.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.640]   At the end of the day, I don't think there is one.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.720]   It's one of those things you have to say,
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.240]   if you know, you know.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.760]   Because in the wisdom of the world,
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.720]   this doesn't make sense.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.080]   In the way the world thinks, this doesn't make sense.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.200]   The world tells us, look after yourself first,
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.720]   take control of your life, you know,
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.200]   have your life plans and goals,
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.520]   and all those things are good, right?
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.680]   And I'm not dogging on life plans
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.920]   and all those kind of things.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.000]   Please don't hear me wrong, right?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.600]   This isn't a call into self-abuse.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.480]   It's not about that.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.680]   But what we're saying is this.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.560]   When Jesus calls someone into the journey of discipleship,
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.960]   it's not just suffering for the sake of suffering.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.000]   It's not just following for the sake of following.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.520]   But he calls us because he says,
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.880]   no one can have two masters, right?
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.720]   You'll either love one or hate the other.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.600]   He calls us to love the Lord our God
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.720]   with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.000]   And we'll never be able to do this
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.920]   if we're still holding on to our own vision for our lives.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.720]   And yes, I know, like I said, it doesn't make sense,
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.680]   but that is actually how it's supposed to be.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:56.080]   Don't be so foolish to be deceived
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.920]   by this world's way of thinking
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.400]   that the world's way of doing things
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.600]   is the right way of doing things.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   Scripture reminds us, and it's counterintuitive,
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.120]   it's countercultural.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.720]   It's foolishness from the world's perspective.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.720]   But the foolishness of God is wiser than human,
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.320]   and it's the foolishness of human wisdom.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:22.000]   And if it doesn't make sense to you now,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.600]   this will only make sense to you
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.200]   when your hearts and minds have been made new.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.760]   When Jesus gives you that new mind
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.560]   and that new life that he's promised you
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.200]   once you decide to deny yourself,
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.200]   pick up his cross, and follow him.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.680]   And once you receive this new life,
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.680]   you see the freedom and the fruit and the purpose
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.360]   wholeheartedly devoted to Jesus.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:49.320]   Jesus tells us this way in Matthew chapter 13.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.240]   Following Jesus is like discovering treasure
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.800]   that's hidden in a field.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.080]   When a man found it, he hid it again,
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   then in his joy went and sold, gave up everything he had
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.280]   and bought the field so that he could have the treasure.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.680]   Again, the kingdom of heaven, following Jesus
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.920]   is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.080]   When he found one of great value,
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   he went away, sold everything he had, and bought that pearl.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.800]   If you want to know purpose in life,
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.960]   if you want to know why God has put you on this earth,
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.720]   the only way to find out is to give him
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.040]   everything you've got.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.960]   Following him will cost you everything, church.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.680]   That is true.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.720]   There are no half measures in this journey.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.040]   It's sink or swim.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.040]   But when you give everything you've got to Jesus,
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:50.240]   he promises to give us life
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.760]   and life in the fullest in return.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.800]   So how does this relate back to forgiveness?
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.280]   See, this is why forgiveness is important for us
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.240]   as followers of Jesus.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.840]   This is because it can't just be the get out of jail
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.520]   free card that we need to use whenever we mess up.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.120]   Because forgiveness isn't about cheap grace.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.160]   Forgiveness is about God using it as a way
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.760]   to guide and shape and mold us,
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.120]   to help us to die to ourselves in order to follow him.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.440]   He knows that along the way it's gonna be difficult.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.800]   He knows that along the way that we're gonna stumble
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.880]   and fall, we're gonna sin, we're gonna mess up.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.200]   He knows all that stuff.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:39.000]   But this is why he gave us his forgiveness.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.160]   Not to use as a way to abuse it,
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.200]   but to use as a way for him to encourage us,
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.040]   to help us along in this journey,
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.320]   to say, hey, it's okay, child.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.280]   That's what Jesus is saying.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.800]   Every time we met, I see you, I love you.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.600]   Now let's pick yourself back up.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.920]   I forgive you.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.120]   Keep going.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.400]   Keep walking towards me.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.360]   Keep coming towards me.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.000]   My forgiveness will always be there for you
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.600]   if you're willing to take this journey with me.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:12.920]   Without forgiveness, our journey to be more like Jesus
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.560]   would not be possible.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.200]   But with forgiveness, it becomes this beautiful,
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.920]   amazing thing that we can embrace and hold,
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.320]   knowing that even if we mess up along the way,
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.400]   God's grace is there to catch us
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.560]   and to encourage us on this journey
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.080]   towards discipleship with him.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.240]   So you see this church, all this, right?
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.680]   All these prayers we have about forgiveness.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:41.680]   I don't see it as just about forgiveness.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.800]   I see these prayers, I see these things
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.400]   are being written out as a hard cry,
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.680]   not to be better at forgiving, but to be more like Jesus.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.360]   Right, we want to deal with these things.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.840]   We want to have forgiveness in our lives.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.440]   We want to be rid of the darkness and the sin
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.200]   and the chains that hold us back,
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.120]   all these things that we've been holding us.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.000]   We want to give them to the Lord to be free of them
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.400]   so that we can be a church that wholeheartedly follows him.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:12.720]   So let's not cheapen forgiveness, church.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:18.920]   In order for Jesus to forgive us, it cost him his life.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   So it's only fitting that if we want to live
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.640]   in his grace and forgiveness,
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.720]   if we want to know the true meaning of our lives,
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.400]   then we have to give that to him as well.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.440]   This is the kind of people he's looking for.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.960]   So don't wait.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.880]   This is my last encouragement for you.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.000]   Today, if you've been reminded that Jesus asked you
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   to follow him with all your life, make that decision now.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.240]   Do it now.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.280]   'Cause the last danger is we might be sitting here
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.560]   thinking, oh, you know, it's okay.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.040]   I have time, right?
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.840]   There's still things I want to do.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.440]   There's still goals in life I haven't achieved.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.200]   You know, there's still certain things I want to experience
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.800]   before giving my life to Jesus.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.760]   And so let me go and do those things first.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.840]   And then I might come and think about following Jesus.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:22.160]   I urge you, church, there is no time to delay.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.000]   Do not delay.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.400]   Don't be like that foolish person in the parable
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.800]   who says to themselves, you know,
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.320]   I'm gonna take life easy, eat, drink, and be merry,
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.560]   just live my life until the right time
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.720]   comes to respond to Jesus.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.680]   Only for God to respond to him, you fool.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.360]   This very night, your life will be demanded from you.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:47.520]   I don't say that to scare us or to try and guilt you
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.760]   or to try and manipulate your thinking,
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.640]   but this is the truth.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.080]   We don't know how long we have life on this earth.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:01.800]   Jesus is coming back or your life could be over
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.640]   at any moment.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   So today, right now, in this moment,
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.200]   this is the time to make your decision,
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.440]   to decide to follow him,
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.400]   to decide that you're done with your old life,
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.880]   to pick up that cross and discover
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.880]   that only through Jesus will you ever discover
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.440]   the amazing journey, the amazing fullness of life
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.280]   that he has promised to you.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.000]   It's going to take pain, it's going to take sacrifice,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.840]   it's going to take you following him
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.640]   with everything you've got.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:43.240]   Until we see Jesus face to face,
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.080]   this is the road that we've been called to follow.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:52.120]   So church, I ask you, will we be that generation?
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.160]   Can we be that body of Christ who takes Jesus seriously
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.760]   at his word to live for him and him alone?
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.240]   Will we cherish forgiveness so much
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:10.120]   that we use it, that we let it shape us
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:14.440]   and guide us and mold us, not to do whatever we want,
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.640]   but into becoming more like our savior?
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.360]   If you would close your eyes, church,
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.640]   I wonder if you would just reflect
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.320]   and think about the challenge
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.000]   the Lord has set before us today.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:43.920]   Yeah, maybe we're in this room
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.880]   and there are chains that have been holding us
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.080]   and there is sin in our life
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.600]   that we haven't dealt with yet.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.000]   (soft music)
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:59.480]   And God's forgiveness is on offer, it is.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.960]   It's there for you today.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:08.480]   But he wants to help you deal with that,
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.720]   not to go back to it, but to be free from it.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:17.320]   And so Lord, for anyone in that space,
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.880]   Lord, I pray for freedom from sin.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.320]   I pray that as we bring these things before you,
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.840]   the strongholds, the chains that were once holding us,
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.000]   Lord, would be released, would be broken,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.400]   that the enemy would flee
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.640]   so that we can take the first step forward.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.120]   Or maybe even just the first glance,
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:50.000]   the first look at you, to look towards you for direction,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.280]   for help, for new life.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:57.240]   And maybe some of us in this room
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:01.360]   have made that decision to follow you.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.800]   And in our heart, in our minds,
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.520]   we've said, yes, this is what we want to do.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:11.000]   But it is really hard.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.920]   I know it's hard to put you above everything else.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.400]   And perhaps we've been distracted
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.640]   and we've let things of this world entice us
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:26.440]   and to draw us and to distract us into thinking,
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.760]   oh, that's my purpose, that's my goal, that's my truth.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:40.800]   Lord, I pray that you would help us see our greater purpose.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.360]   That you would meet us in those places
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   and that we would offer that over to you
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:53.360]   and allow you to just take our life wherever you wanted to.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:58.200]   Even it means letting go of some of those things
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.000]   or all of those things, we're willing to say,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.640]   Lord, I am willing because I want to follow you more.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:09.880]   For some of us, maybe we're out of luck.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.920]   For some of us, maybe we're our lives right now,
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.920]   you would say, it's good actually, dude.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:18.920]   Like, everything's set for once maybe
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:24.480]   and it's, you know, I like the way I'm living.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.520]   I'm comfortable.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:33.680]   Maybe the challenge for you today is
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.560]   for God to speak to you and say, yeah, I see that.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.960]   But what the Lord promises us is so much more
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.360]   than just comfort and good.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:49.880]   What the Lord promises us in the life with him
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.200]   is fullness of joy,
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:58.200]   is purpose, and that it could even be better
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.160]   than the thing that you think is good right now.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:04.080]   I guarantee you, Jesus is 10 million gazillion times
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.040]   better than that.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.920]   If only you would pick up your cross,
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.840]   deny yourself and truly follow him,
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.800]   you would discover how amazing life with Jesus is
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.000]   compared to whatever it is that we're chasing right now.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:27.200]   And so, Jesus, we just lay ourselves bare before you.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.880]   And finally, I just thank you
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.240]   that we don't do this in our own power.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   That we have the Holy Spirit guiding us, walking with us,
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.640]   empowering us, strengthening us every single step of the way.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.400]   We are not alone in this journey.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.560]   Holy Spirit goes with us.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.840]   Your brothers and sisters along the journey with you
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.400]   go with you to encourage you.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:56.120]   And so, Jesus, help us in this.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.840]   I pray that we may deny ourselves,
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:06.080]   pick up our cross and live lives that are wholeheartedly
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.680]   and only dedicated to you and you alone.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.880]   This is our prayer, Lord, in Jesus' name.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.720]   Lord, in Jesus' name.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.320]   (gentle music)
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.920]   (gentle music)
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.520]   (gentle music)
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.120]   (gentle music)
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.700]   (gentle music)
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.760]   you
