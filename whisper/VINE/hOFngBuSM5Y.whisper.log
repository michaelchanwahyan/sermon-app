[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340]   We're so glad you're here.
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.400]   Perhaps you just arrived in Hong Kong and you're settling into the city.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.400]   And we're so glad that you're here and glad that you're discovering churches in our city.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.920]   And there's lots of great churches in Hong Kong.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.120]   We encourage you to check out a number of churches.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.720]   But if this is your heart, this is your home, we're so grateful that you're here.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.680]   Perhaps you're visiting, maybe you're part of a family or maybe you're visiting family
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.840]   that live in Hong Kong in this season.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.680]   We're glad you're here.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.680]   I'm really excited.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.920]   I normally here at the Vine, we preach in series.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.920]   That's what we do.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.080]   So we normally do four to week, four weeks, six weeks, 10 week series, something like
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.080]   that.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.380]   But every once in a while in between series, I get a chance to do a one-off message with
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.720]   you and that's what today is.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.160]   And I have a something on my heart that I've been caring for us as a community for some
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.580]   time.
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.500]   Something that is very dear to my heart because it's a message I'm preaching to myself this
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.920]   morning.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.920]   Everything I'm saying to you this morning, I'm speaking into my spirit because I desperately
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.240]   need this.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.360]   I want to read you a passage of Jesus.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.120]   One of the most beautiful things I think Jesus says to the crowds as he's teaching in Galilee.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.520]   You've already heard it actually, Justin read it to us just a bit earlier.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.360]   This is Matthew chapter 11, starting in verse 28.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.600]   And I wonder whether you could hear these words and have these words go into your spirit
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.280]   and soul this morning.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.640]   Jesus says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.680]   I don't believe that there's any more beautiful promise in scripture than that.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.880]   "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart and you
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.520]   will find rest for your souls.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.240]   For my yoke is easy, my burden is light."
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.560]   Father, as we open your scriptures, would you open us?
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.680]   Would you just take a moment to recognize the weariness and the burden that you carry?
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:07.440]   Father, we enter into this space recognizing the need we have for your rest.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:16.240]   Holy spirit, as we open this passage, would you, Lord, I pray, lift burdens, lift weight,
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.000]   renew joy.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.240]   We pray this in Jesus name.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.800]   Jesus says, "Amen."
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.600]   These words are profound to me.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.480]   They're some of the most famous words of Jesus in all of scripture.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.760]   In fact, these words have been reproduced on cheesy Christian fridge magnets, bumper
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.120]   stickers, t-shirts, coffee mugs, in our modern time IG posts.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.040]   I'm sure you've seen these words somewhere on your Instagram feed at some time.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.600]   I, in fact, posted these words on my Instagram feed earlier this week.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.940]   These are famous and familiar words.
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.760]   And they're famous and familiar words for a very important reason, for actually a very
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.360]   critical reason.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.080]   Because in these words, Jesus offers us something that speaks to a need that is in every human
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   being.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.920]   And I would argue a need that is in every modern human, maybe in a time of history like
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.280]   never before.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.080]   And that is the need for rest.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.160]   Yes, this beautiful idea of rest.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.480]   I mean, if you could think about it, I don't think there's a better word or a better promise
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:32.400]   in all of scripture for us who are stressed out, burnt out, exhausted, overwhelmed, overproducing,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.720]   overfocused, kind of overworked, sort of stressed.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.320]   All the things that we know we are in Hong Kong.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.400]   Could there be a better promise to us than this?
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.800]   In fact, I'm kind of surprised that when Jesus wrote this, he didn't start by saying to the
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.320]   people of the church in Hong Kong, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   I will give you rest."
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.480]   This should resonate with you here this morning, because this is July and you're still in Hong
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.800]   Kong, which means that you're not on vacation right now.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   So you are a people desperately in need of rest, amen?
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.920]   The empty chairs, normally the 915 doesn't have any empty chairs in it.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.200]   The empty chairs you see around you are the people that chose to be on vacation this morning,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   okay?
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.800]   So you are here.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.200]   And if you're anything like me, when you think about rest, you're crying out and you're like,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.680]   "Man, this sounds good."
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.520]   I mean, we know the stress and the burnout and the exhaustion, the tiredness, the overwhelmed.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.360]   We know the hard work that a boss puts upon us.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.600]   We know how desperately our physicality, our emotions, and our minds, our spirits, and
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.960]   our souls need rest.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   And when we hear this from Jesus, we are just crying out, "Yes and amen," more and more.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.560]   But here's the reality, what Jesus is actually speaking about in this passage is actually
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.680]   a lot different from what we think that He's speaking about.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.400]   In fact, what Jesus is calling us into in this passage is different from what we hope
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.120]   He's calling us into.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.680]   What we think we need when Jesus says rest.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.520]   You see, you've got to understand that in our modern context, when we read this and
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.440]   we hear Jesus say, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.720]   rest," we immediately have our modern thinking about what we think we need when we think
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.080]   of the idea of rest.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.040]   And when Jesus says, "Come to me and you will find rest," we think that Jesus is inviting
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.860]   us on a permanent vacation.
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.860]   We think Jesus is literally inviting us to drink pina coladas on the beach in Bali.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.700]   We think this is amazing because we're stressed out, we're exhausted, we're desperately in
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.760]   need of ceasing our productivity.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.300]   So when Jesus says, "Come to me and I will give you rest," what we think He's saying
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.460]   is, "Come to me and you can cease your productivity.
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.740]   Come to me and you can put work aside.
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.960]   Come to me and you'll never have to work a day in your life."
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   And when we hear that, we're like, "Yes and amen!"
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.380]   I mean, who here doesn't want to put work aside and kind of get rid of all that exhaustion
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.100]   and just spend the rest of our lives kumbaya-ing with Jesus?
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.900]   I mean, that sounds amazing.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.020]   And so when we read this, we're exactly like that.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.980]   We're like, "Give this to me, Jesus."
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.560]   And Jesus is like, "That's about as far away from what I'm trying to say through this passage.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.780]   You're desperately in need of finishing work.
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.600]   I want to renew work inside of you.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:40.820]   So come to me, you who are currently weary and burdened because of the way in which you
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:48.220]   are working, and I will change everything."
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.540]   See what Jesus is actually saying is something far grander and far bigger and far more amazing
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.380]   than we could ever imagine.
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.580]   And when we just catch a glimpse of what it is that Jesus is trying to teach us in this
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:07.300]   verse, what happens to us is that we shift away from desperately needing to escape from
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.680]   this life to desperately wanting to lean into this life.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.680]   Come on, church.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.420]   I know this is the summer, but come on, church.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.660]   Are you okay?
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.700]   We want to desperately escape life, and so we think that Jesus, when he offers our rest,
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.700]   our ticket to escape life, Jesus is like, "No, when you understand what it is to come
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.820]   to me, you are revolutionized to live the life that you were actually created to live
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.820]   in the first place."
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.580]   You've got to understand that when Jesus says, "Come to me, all you who are in burden, and
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.140]   I will give you rest," he's actually not speaking to modern Hong Kong.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.700]   He's speaking to first century Galilee.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.820]   He's speaking to people who were farmers, people who were workers of the field, people
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:56.700]   who were average, everyday people in the first century living under the exhaustion of empire.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.860]   Jewish people, Jewish people who understood their scriptures and were looking for the
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:07.100]   Messiah, Jewish people who understood that God had set something up at the beginning
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:13.580]   of all time in this area of rest that had been disrupted by sin, and now we're desperately
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.720]   waiting for the Messiah to come to bring them back into a place of biblical rest, which
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.220]   let me tell you, unfortunately, is not a pina colada on a beach in Bali, but is something
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:31.260]   much greater and actually the thing that you really need.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:36.060]   To understand that, we have to step out of our modern context and step into the biblical
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.060]   context.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.060]   We need to do that by going to my favorite three chapters of the Bible.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.320]   Do you know what my favorite three chapters of the Bible, you should know this by now
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.320]   if you come to the Vine.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.320]   One of my favorite three chapters of the Bible, everyone.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.160]   All right, I got work to do.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.500]   Genesis 1, 2, and 3.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.080]   We just spent a whole month in those passages in our justice series.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.080]   Genesis 1, 2, and 3.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.800]   What you see in Genesis 1 and 2 is that God sets up something for humanity.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.100]   I like to call it this way.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.760]   In the whole of the creation moment in Genesis 1 and 2, the pinnacle, the climax, the creation
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.520]   of humanity, the placing us within the garden, God then gives us two essential rhythms for
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   human flourishing.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.840]   Let me unpack these briefly for you.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.720]   Two essential rhythms to your human flourishing.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.720]   The rhythm of work and the rhythm of rest.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.660]   It's important you have to understand that we were created to work.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.720]   God actually in Genesis 1 and 2, when he creates humanity, he places them in the garden and
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.800]   then God gives these words to humanity.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.880]   He says, "I want you to go into the garden, go into creation, and I want you to steward
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.880]   it.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.680]   I want you to bring it to the fullness of what it was created to be."
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.880]   This mirrors what God had done in the larger work of creation.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.200]   Remember, humanity is made in the image of God.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.640]   We see in the wider story of Genesis 1 and 2 in God's creation that he creates through
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:59.560]   the Spirit and takes something that's formless, gives it form, and then moves it to its fullness.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:05.080]   So, us being made in his image, God then places us into creation and he says, "I want you
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.680]   to do the same thing.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:13.660]   This is what work is, partnering with me to take something into its fullness, partnering
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.080]   with me to flourish my creation."
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:23.380]   So, work in its very essence is grounded in a partnership with God and it's grounded
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.520]   in us imaging him by working with our hands.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.560]   That might mean physically our hands, it might mean just our gifts and our talents, however
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:36.120]   we might do it, in order to bring things into its flourishing so the world would truly be
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.400]   as it was created to be.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.920]   Does that make sense?
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.600]   And when we do that, human beings come alive and they don't need pina coladas on the beach
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.140]   in Bali.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.140]   They find life.
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.880]   So, you've got to see that there's a rhythm that God has created where we are created
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.000]   to work before Genesis 3.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.520]   I want you to see work was a good thing.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.640]   Everyone say, "Amen."
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.640]   Even the bankers and the lawyers in this room, say, "Amen," with me.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.640]   Come on.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.640]   I love it.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.240]   I used to be a banker, by the way, so that's okay.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.240]   I can say that.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.320]   On the other side, though, God then institutes this idea of rest.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.320]   Oh, everybody say, "Amen."
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.320]   Okay, thank you.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   Just one person.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   That's great.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.200]   So, in rest, God does two things in Genesis 1 and 2.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.800]   First of all, I want you to see that in the order of his creation, he instills rest first.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.880]   There is those famous words at the end of every day of creation.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:31.400]   He says this, "Then there was evening and morning the first day."
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.840]   Or he would say, "Then there's evening and morning the second day or the third day or
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.840]   the fourth day."
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.680]   Notice that when God describes a day, he starts with rest.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680]   Come on, church.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.920]   "When there was evening and then there was morning the first day."
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.920]   So God sees that one of the rhythms to human flourishing, notice this, and this is really
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:58.120]   important, God has actually designed it so that we humans flourish the best when we are
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.760]   operating out of rest and not into rest.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.020]   Come on, church.
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.240]   When we're operating out of a place of rest, not into a place of rest.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.480]   Now all of us, when we think of vacation and holiday, here's our mentality.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:17.180]   I'm going to work really hard because I've got a vacation coming up when I can collapse.
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.040]   That's working into rest.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:25.120]   But God creates the evening and the morning, the first day, confirming to us that this
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.400]   is the way in which human flourishing comes.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.600]   You work out of a place of rest into the renewable things.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.040]   When you start from rest, you are becoming human and you flourish and you come alive.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.800]   When you need rest as something to collapse into, then you've got it the wrong way around.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.240]   We think of a day as, "Oh, work, work, work, work, work, and then I can get home and watch
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.560]   Netflix."
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.280]   God looks at it like rest so that you can come alive.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.240]   I learned this the hard way for many years when I became a pastor.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.680]   It was funny, when I was a banker, I was stressed but didn't have any physical issues.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.400]   When I became a pastor, I suddenly developed IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, because I was
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.000]   so stressed about everything that I was doing as a pastor.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.280]   I was weighed down by the burdens of it.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.400]   I remember going to a doctor and they did all the tests.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.240]   I thought I might have stomach cancer or something going on.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.680]   They did all the tests and ran all the tests and nothing was in my stomach at all.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.600]   No problems, no brokenness, whatever.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   So I sat down with the doctor.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.000]   I'm like, "Doctor, I don't understand this.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.800]   I have bad stomach issues all the time.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.320]   How can you tell me that my stomach is fine?"
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.920]   He said, "Well, it's because of how you're working."
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.120]   I'm like, "I don't understand."
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.960]   He says, "Well, tell me about your work week."
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.240]   So I told him about my work week.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.920]   I said, "I start on a Tuesday and I work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.120]   Sunday's my biggest day and it's such a big day.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.560]   We have three services on a Sunday.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.040]   I preach my guts out and at the end of the day, I'm exhausted, but I have Monday to rest."
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.080]   He's like, "Well, your whole work week, you're working into rest."
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.120]   He said, "What would it look like if you worked out of rest?"
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.720]   I said, "What do you mean?"
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.000]   He said, "Why don't you flip your day around, rather than Monday being your day off, Friday
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   being your day off."
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I'm like, "I can't do that.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Monday's my day off."
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   He's like, "Aren't you the boss?"
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I said, "Yes."
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.880]   He said, "Well, then change your day."
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.880]   So I did.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.240]   I literally changed my day off to Friday.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:16.000]   So now I work Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and I have Friday off.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.960]   And then sometimes if there's stuff going on at the church, I'll work Saturday.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.960]   Sometimes I don't need to.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.960]   Here's the thing.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.280]   Sunday, my biggest day of the week, used to be the thing I was working towards to try
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.760]   to finish so I could collapse afterwards.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.760]   Now Sunday is the first day of my week, which is why I'm so energized when I come into church
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.760]   every week.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.120]   Yes!
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:42.920]   Now I know for all of you, you got into Sunday going, "Oh my God, it's my day off."
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.880]   Whereas I get into Sunday going...
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.880]   Now here's the thing.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.800]   As soon as I changed my work week to being Friday off rather than the Monday off, it
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.640]   totally revolutionized my life and I don't have IBS anymore because I was actually designed
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.600]   to work out of rest, not work into rest.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.960]   What would it look like for you to change the rhythms of your life?
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.480]   Now you might go to your boss tomorrow and say, "I want Fridays off."
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.880]   And they're like, "No, no, not going to happen."
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.280]   So you got to work out how this is going to work for you.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.840]   My boss is Jesus, so I'm good.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.320]   But you, you know...
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.960]   But what would it look like for you to work out of a place of rest, not work into a place
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.960]   of rest?
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.960]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.440]   Just even that thought for some of you here today is revolutionary for you.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.240]   Now here's the second thing though in the creation narrative, right at the end of it
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.960]   on the seventh day, we know what happened, right?
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.880]   What did God do on the seventh day?
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.880]   He rested.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.880]   Now here's the error.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.580]   Again, we apply our modern understanding to rest to that concept.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.440]   So we often think, "Well, God was exhausted from all of his hard work of things, so on
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.660]   one day he had to rest."
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.100]   Now the actual Hebrew word that's used for rest here means, better translated, "ceased."
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:51.680]   So what it means is he ceased from his work, he ceased from his producing, not because
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.520]   he was exhausted, but because he was done.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.520]   The very different concept.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:05.000]   In other words, the world was just as it should be, so God didn't need to do anything more.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.480]   Not that he was exhausted and needed rest.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.920]   He's not going into rest.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.340]   He's saying, "No, everything is just as it should be."
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.800]   And he stands back from that and says, "This is very good."
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.980]   It's a little bit like, imagine an artist with a beautiful painting and they've been
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.740]   working on the painting for months, and there's that moment right at the end where they put
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:26.000]   the last brushstroke of ink or paint onto that painting, and then they stand back and
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.800]   they look at it and they go, "Hang on a sec.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.360]   It's done."
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.080]   And they put the paintbrush down.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.400]   Not because they're exhausted, but because it is finished.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.080]   So God stands back from his creation and says, "This is very good."
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.200]   Now here's the mistake we make because of this later on in the law, later on through
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.960]   the Exodus and further on.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.540]   This day gets created as the Sabbath day for humanity, for the Jewish people, where one
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.300]   day a week they cease their work, they put it all down in order to connect with God,
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.340]   rely on him, rest as well.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.180]   So Sabbath is established because of this seventh day that God rested.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:07.340]   But I want you to see that in the Genesis 1 and 2 narrative, this is naturally not speaking
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.860]   about Sabbath.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.100]   That was institutionalized later.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.440]   What it's saying here is this is Shalom, not Sabbath.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.980]   This is God standing back and saying, "This is just as it was created to be.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.760]   Everything is where it should be.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.500]   This is a place of peace.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.860]   This is rest."
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.540]   Are you with me?
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.460]   So when Jesus says, "Come to me, all you who are wearing burdens, and I will give you rest,"
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.300]   he's not speaking about Sabbath.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.580]   Come on, church.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.700]   Now Jesus teaches on Sabbath in other places, often to try to revolutionize Sabbath because
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.420]   Sabbath had become a burden to people.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.780]   He tries to liberate them from it.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.960]   But in Matthew 11, he's not speaking about Sabbath.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.560]   He's not talking about a rest where just get away on vacation for a while and everything
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.160]   will be reset for you.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.200]   He's actually talking about something much deeper.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.080]   He's actually going back to Genesis 1 and 2, the last brushstroke, stepping back and
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:03.280]   saying, "Everything is right again."
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.480]   Now we know what happens in Genesis 3, don't we?
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.080]   In Genesis 3, everything changes.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.320]   Because in Genesis 3, there's Adam and Eve, and they take the fruit that they shouldn't
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.520]   have taken from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.220]   We know that sin comes into the context, and sin disrupts everything.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.960]   Remember those four relational contexts we were talking about in our justice series?
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:26.040]   Us with God, us with ourselves, us with others, us with creation, all created for us in Genesis
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.360]   1 and 2 as good.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.280]   All four of those are disrupted because of sin in Genesis 3.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.880]   And because our relationship with God breaks, our relationship with ourselves breaks, our
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.880]   relationship with everybody else breaks, and our relationship even with creation breaks,
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.600]   sin impacts everything that was established in Genesis 1 and 2, including, most importantly,
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.020]   the essential rhythms for human flourishing.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.680]   Our rhythm of work and our rhythm of rest, totally disrupted.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.840]   In fact, I want to show you how this impacts specifically our rhythms of work.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:02.640]   Let me take you to Genesis 3, and I'm just going to read from a few verses, from verses
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.640]   17 to 19.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.640]   It says this.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.520]   It says this is God speaking to Adam and Eve after the reality of the sin.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.960]   He said, "Cursed is the ground because of you.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.580]   Through painful toil you will now eat of it all the days of your life.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.320]   It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.800]   By the sweat of your brow you will eat the food until you return to the ground since
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.240]   from which you were taken.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.240]   For dust you are, and to dust you will return."
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.800]   So in trying to explain the impact that sin has had on the essential rhythms for human
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:43.080]   flourishing, God says, "Don't you realize that now work and rest is going to be completely
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   different for you."
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.560]   Notice the language he uses here.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.320]   He says, "It will now be a place of toil for you.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.200]   It will be a place where there will be a sweat of your brow."
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.200]   Like this is not a good thing.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.200]   What was supposed to be a place of your great flourishing will now become a place of burden.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.600]   I want you to see something really important here, church.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.720]   God is not saying work is evil.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.740]   He's saying humanity is evil.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.760]   He's not saying work is sinful.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.720]   He's saying humanity is sinful.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:16.120]   He's saying now the ground is cursed because of you.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.120]   Because of what you've done.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.840]   Because of the reality of bringing sin into this world.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.560]   Everything now changes, and here's what's produced.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.880]   What's produced is a breakdown in all of those relational contexts, and now a desire for
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.560]   us to try to fix things.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.880]   Because before we were fully filled in peace with our relationship with God, our relationship
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.360]   with ourselves, our relationship with others, our relationship with creation.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.240]   Now everything has wrecked.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.760]   And because everything's wrecked, we think now as humans, how do we get back to Genesis
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.000]   1 and 2?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.680]   And here's what we end up doing.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.520]   We take that burden onto our shoulders.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:57.240]   In the place of feeling uncomfortable about how everything is broken around us, we try
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.720]   to fix everything.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:05.000]   And when humanity tries to fix everything, guess what happens?
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.080]   You get exhausted.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.720]   You see, when our relationship with God is broken, here's our immediate fix for it.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.200]   Well, I guess I'm going to have to be God myself.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.240]   Well, I'm going to have to take on all the responsibilities.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.640]   I'm going to have to try hard.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.320]   I'm going to have to provide for everyone.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.680]   I'm going to have to control everything around me, and that is exhausting.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.720]   When our relationship with ourselves breaks, here's what happens.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.400]   The Bible calls it that we have an orphan spirit inside of us.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.480]   In other words, we no longer have a connection with our Father.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.440]   We no longer have that, "This is my son, whom I love.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.880]   With him I am well pleased."
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.960]   Instead, we feel torn apart inside of us.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.100]   We feel shame about who we are because of the sin on us.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.560]   And so we try to cover that up as best we can, or we try to prove that we're worthy
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.440]   of love, or prove that we're somebody in this world.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.720]   And we try to label success upon ourselves, or strive really hard to try to make a name
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.360]   for ourselves, and we wonder why we're exhausted.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.800]   And then our relationship with others breaks, which makes sense because if this thing's
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.480]   broken and if this thing's broken, then we're going to really struggle to make this thing
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   work.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.800]   And as we look around us and the relationships in our lives, here's what happens.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:19.080]   We start trying to create relationships to try to fill the void that is inside of us.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.120]   And so we find and we move from relationship to relationship, from dating to dating, sometimes
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.120]   from marriages to marriages.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:30.240]   And we're trying to use people around us to try to feel better about what's broken inside
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.280]   of us, and we wonder why we're exhausted.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.920]   And then even our relationship with creation breaks, and either we just ignore it and exploit
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.680]   it and couldn't care less, or we do the opposite, which is, I think, even worse.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.640]   Well, maybe not worse, but just as bad.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.240]   We worship it.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.760]   We think that creation is the place that's going to fix everything.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.160]   And so it's mother nature this and mother nature that, and if only I can get back to
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.300]   the rhythms of the earth.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.280]   We become new age and we worship creation around us.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.660]   All of these things are happening in our lives, and they create a drive within us to try to
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.280]   fix ourselves because of the brokenness of sin.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.520]   I call this a striving mentality.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.680]   Are you following this?
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.240]   All of us have this striving mentality.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:22.840]   Think about it, where we were once operating out of a place of rest into a place of thriving
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:29.540]   before sin, now we are operating out of a place of disorder into a place of striving
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.960]   because of sin.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.760]   You follow that?
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:38.360]   And this striving mentality that is in work around all of us is causing us to try to prove
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.760]   ourselves, try to work harder, to try to do this and that, and we're trying to do something
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:49.440]   which we were never created in the first place to do, and we are burnt out, we are exhausted,
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:57.140]   we are weary, we are stressed, and it is a horrible way to live.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:02.080]   And when we're finding all of that at work within us, no wonder there's this disruption
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.280]   inside of us.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.760]   And we're trying to fix ourselves and we realize that we can't.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:15.440]   What we have to understand is that any time we strive to try to restore what is broken
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:21.880]   within us because of sin in any other source other than Jesus himself, we will only become
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.800]   more and more exhausted and less and less free.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   Come on, church.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:34.240]   It's just the reality of the human life.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.760]   This was how the people in the first century were feeling.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.980]   They weren't in need of some nice drink on the beach in Bali.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.360]   They were in need of a revolution in their soul.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.920]   They were in need of becoming what it really truly meant to be human again.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.800]   And so Jesus shows up and he says these words, and I wonder if they'll sound a little different
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   to you now.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:04.540]   "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.400]   The words that Jesus uses for weary and burdened here, weary means striving to the point of
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:15.280]   exhaustion, working to the point where I have nothing left in energy.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:21.940]   The word burdened here literally means carrying a weight which I cannot bear or being overwhelmed
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.520]   in heaviness that I was not created to carry.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:29.640]   These are the only two times in the whole of the gospels that Jesus uses these specific
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   words.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:36.060]   He's talking into what happened because of sin in Genesis 3, and he's saying, "If any
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:44.580]   of you here feel this weariness, feel this burden, there is help."
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.580]   What is the help?
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.620]   He says, "Come to me."
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.080]   I love this.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:55.060]   Jesus doesn't offer a 12-step plan to reduce striving in your life.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:26:00.760]   Jesus doesn't give a guide or a strategy to try to help you to balance better the stress
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.280]   around you.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.780]   God is not interested in reducing your striving.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.460]   He wants to eliminate it.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.700]   Come on, church.
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.860]   He's not interested in just helping you to manage your stress a little better.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.860]   He doesn't want you to have three days off, four days off, and only work two or three
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.740]   days and get the balance better.
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:24.660]   Jesus wants to eliminate the need that you have to rest by discovering that in relationship
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.740]   with him, we find our rest.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.420]   That our relationship with him changes everything for us.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.980]   And Jesus says, "Come to me."
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.660]   He doesn't say, "Earn me."
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.620]   He doesn't say, "Work hard for me."
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.020]   He doesn't say, "Try to prove yourself for me."
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.020]   Us Christians, we get this wrong all the time.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:49.760]   We take our striving mentality to try to make ourselves look like something in the world
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.940]   around us, and we apply that to our faith in Jesus.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:57.820]   And because striving has become such an embedded part of our orphan spirit, when it comes to
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.020]   Jesus, we strive to win his affections.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.900]   We strive to do more Bible studies.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.380]   We strive to do this.
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.060]   We work to prove that we are worthy of being loved.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.620]   I love what Jesus says here.
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.260]   He says, "Come to me, all you who are perfect."
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.420]   No, he doesn't say that.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:19.140]   He doesn't say, "Come to me, all you who are feeling good about life."
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.180]   No, "Come to me, all you who deserve to be in my presence."
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.660]   He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened."
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.580]   In other words, he doesn't say, "Clean yourself up and then come to me."
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.260]   He doesn't say, "Get better and then come to me."
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.980]   He doesn't say, "Hey, do a bunch of Bible studies, then come to me."
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.700]   He says, "No, I'm here in the weary and the burden that you're feeling right now, in your
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.140]   exhaustion and stress."
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:48.140]   The only qualification you need for Jesus is a weariness and a burden.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:55.060]   The only qualification you need for Jesus is a weariness and a burden.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:28:00.060]   The needier you are, the more perfect you are for Jesus.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.500]   Oh, isn't that beautiful?
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.860]   Like the needier you are, like the more stressed out...
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.940]   Now, that doesn't mean that we try to get stressed out so that we can have a relationship
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:10.940]   with Jesus.
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.620]   Okay, don't take it to its extreme, but you know what I'm saying.
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.620]   Like we're qualified.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.860]   Are you with me?
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.860]   We're qualified because we're sinners in need of a Savior.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.740]   And Jesus doesn't expect you to get perfect.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:26.580]   He says, "Come to me now, like today, like in the place of your stress, in the place
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.100]   of your sin, in the place of your weariness, in the place of your burden, in the weight
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.740]   that you can no longer carry.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:37.020]   Come to me and I will give you rest right now.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.740]   I will take it off your shoulders."
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.460]   How does he do that?
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.400]   How does God take it off our shoulders?
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.480]   That's what he says in the second half of the verse here.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.480]   I love this.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:53.040]   He says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.240]   and you will find rest for your souls.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.320]   For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.520]   I love this.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:06.720]   Jesus is so counter-cultural and sometimes he says things that seem so counterproductive.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.040]   Like he's just said, "Come to me and I will give you rest."
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.080]   And then he says, "Take a yoke upon you."
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.120]   And you're like, "Hang on a second.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.040]   That doesn't sound like drinks on the beach in Bali.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.960]   That doesn't sound like what I need."
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.440]   Because let me tell you what I need, Jesus.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.760]   Anybody ever tell Jesus what you need?
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.040]   Let me tell you what I need, Jesus.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.360]   I need this cessation of work.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.080]   I need to put work down.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.880]   I need to get rid of all of the yokes.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.320]   I don't need to have any shackles.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.160]   I don't want to have any responsibilities.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.920]   All I want to do is be at your feet, Jesus.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.620]   And Jesus is like, "No, you need to understand.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:42.360]   You need to go back to Genesis 1 and 2 and remember what are the two essential flourishings
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.400]   for humanity?
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.360]   The gift of work and the gift of rest.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.840]   And when you bring those back through relationship with me into the place where they should be,
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:51.840]   then everything changes."
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.000]   So he's saying, "I'm not inviting you to a cessation of work.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.720]   I'm not inviting you to a permanent, eternal holiday.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.680]   I'm inviting you to fresh work.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.960]   Take your yoke on me.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.240]   My yoke on you."
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:14.480]   Now a yoke, in case you're not aware, was a wooden beam that was created and shaped
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.540]   for farmers.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.520]   And it would be a wooden beam like this that would have two loops around it that would
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.380]   get fastened on the neck of animals so that two animals would be yoked together, kind
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.960]   of caught up together.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.640]   Normally, it would be oxen, and they would, through the yoke, maybe drag a plow through
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.180]   a field or they might drag a cart to the market, taking goods to the market.
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.240]   So this yoke with the things around it were for these two oxen.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.300]   Now here's what you may not know.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:44.400]   In the yoke, it was mostly made by carpenters.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.600]   Come on, guys.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.720]   Yokes were made of wood.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.400]   Carpenters didn't make nice rickety chairs to put on the porch so you can go back and
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.400]   forth on.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.800]   Carpenters, in Jesus' day, made farming tools when they lived in Nazareth and Galilee.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.780]   So the chances are Jesus made a number of yokes before.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.640]   So here's a yoke.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.300]   Now what farmers would do is they would take a big, strong, heavy ox and they would take
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.800]   a less strong ox and they would yoke those two together.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.920]   Rarely would they yoke two strong oxes together.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.640]   Normally, a stronger ox and a slightly weaker ox.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.640]   Why?
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.820]   Because the weaker ox, they're trying to grow up to be a strong ox.
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:23.800]   So then in the future, the weaker ox would then be the one on the right side carrying
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.580]   the heavy burden, and then there would be a more junior ox alongside of it.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.920]   So a farmer would always take a strong ox and a slightly less strong ox and yoke them
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920]   together.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.600]   Now the strong ox would have a part of the yoke that fit over them and was tight and
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.420]   snug which meant they would carry more of the weight.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:43.640]   The younger ox would have a slightly looser noose around it which mean it would still
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.760]   carry some weight but not as much as a strong ox.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.960]   Are you with me?
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.960]   And the point of this was that the young ox would learn from the stronger ox how to carry
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:56.820]   more weight and over time would mature enough to be able to take on the fuller load.
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.840]   So Jesus says, "You're living life wrong.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.360]   You're stressed out and striving because you've got a striving mentality.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.600]   Come to me because I'm the only one that can deal with striving because of the death and
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.960]   resurrection on the cross.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:15.040]   When you come in relationship to me, I will release you from a striving lifestyle and
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.640]   place you back into a renewal of work that is right and good."
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:23.100]   It's still like in Genesis 1 and 2, a partnership with God.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.500]   You now have a partnership.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.120]   You're yoked now with me.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.640]   And he's like, he doesn't say this but he's basically saying, "I'm the heavy yoke.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.640]   I'm the ox in here that's carrying most of the weight.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:38.800]   I'm going to share the load with you but there's still a burden for you to carry.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.200]   There's still a yoke that you should have.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.400]   There's still something that is around you."
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:48.000]   But and this is why he says in the passage, he says, "Learn from me.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Come on."
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.440]   He says, "Learn from me.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.440]   Be with me.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.280]   I'm going to partner with you, walk alongside of you.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.300]   I'm not suddenly going to wave a magic wand and suddenly all your stresses and your troubles
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.060]   will go away.
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.040]   But I will yoke myself to your burden.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.760]   I will be the one who will carry most of that burden.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.800]   I will stand with you, walk with you, come alongside of you.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.200]   I will take the heavy load.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.900]   I'm not going to totally release the load from you because there's stuff you can learn
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:17.900]   from me that will strengthen you to be more like me so that in Ephesians 4 you will become
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.540]   more like the likeness of Christ."
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:32.260]   So in becoming like Jesus, he says, "Take this yoke on me," which is really a profound
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.260]   thought.
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:39.760]   And he says these words, he says, "For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:46.380]   The word for easy that he uses here means my yoke is kind or good or other translations,
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.180]   it's well fitted for you.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.460]   I love that.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:57.140]   This is Jesus saying, "You were always created to work.
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:01.100]   Work was well fitted to you before sin.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.940]   And now because of sin and the striving mentality, we're all exhausted, absolutely.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.220]   So come to me.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:11.580]   I in my resurrection can give you the fullness of life and I will yoke you to me.
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:17.260]   We will partner again for work that is truly good."
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:24.100]   See this is biblical rest, not an invitation to the cessation of work because we're exhausted
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:29.380]   from our striving, but an invitation to the renewal of work because we have dealt with
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.380]   our striving.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.380]   Isn't that nice?
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:38.220]   That actually maybe there is some amazing things that we get to do with our hands, that
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:42.140]   we get to join God with the paintbrush and the paint on the beautiful work that he's
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.100]   got in the world around us.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.460]   But there are some things like the great commission, some things like the sermon of the mount,
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:54.240]   some things that are a weight upon us, but it's a glorious way.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.460]   It's the way to the gospel, sharing hope into the world around us.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.780]   And this is what we are invited to.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.880]   Come to me, all you are weary and burdened and I will give you rest.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.980]   Take my yoke upon you.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.140]   And he says, "My yoke is easy.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:14.260]   My burden is light, but there is still a yoke and there is still a burden."
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.740]   So you need to understand that what Jesus is teaching us here is that there is no such
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.220]   thing as a yokeless life.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:24.980]   Come on church, no such thing as a yokeless life.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:29.100]   Jesus is not promising a life without responsibility, a life without hard work.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:34.260]   He's not promising a life where suddenly it's a gravy chain and kumbaya with him.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.780]   No there is no such thing as a yokeless life.
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.260]   And actually what Jesus is saying in this passage, when he says, "Take my yoke upon
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.540]   you," is he's saying, "You better remove all the other yokes that are around your neck
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.420]   right now."
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.740]   It's like he's asking, I think, the reader and the hearer of that time and us today a
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:55.940]   question, "What is it that I'm currently yoked to?"
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:01.980]   Because if I stand before you today like I do, and I'm feeling exhausted and tired, I'm
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.780]   feeling overwhelmed and somewhat stressed, and I'm feeling the weight of the world and
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:10.740]   anxiety upon me, and I'm trying to prove that I'm a great pastor in front of all these people,
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.580]   then I have to realize that I am not currently yoked to Jesus.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.280]   Are you with me?
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.180]   Because if we believe what he's saying here is true, that his yoke is easy and his burden
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:27.100]   is light, if I'm stressed out and exhausted, I better be asking myself, "I'm yoked to something
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.500]   other than Jesus."
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:34.080]   That's the starting point to coming to him, is to recognize what it is that you're currently
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   getting yoked to.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.360]   And I want you to understand, if you are yoked to anything other than Jesus, nothing else
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.660]   in creation has been made to carry the weight.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.560]   That means you are going to be carrying the weight.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:50.580]   It is going to be a burden to you, which is why you're feeling exhausted.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:57.300]   And listen to this, you can be yoked to things that are actually on the surface good, but
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.180]   are not Jesus, and you will still feel exhausted.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.140]   Some of you in this room, you are yoked to the vine.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.220]   That's not good.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.220]   We are not Jesus.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.500]   Some of you in this room, you're yoked to a relationship.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.500]   That's not good, because that person is not Jesus.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:21.080]   Some of you here are yoked to your job, yoked to success, yoked to feeling better about
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:25.060]   yourself because you've achieved something, and that's not good because none of that is
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.060]   Jesus.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.540]   If we are yoked ourselves to something other than Christ, we will end up taking the burden
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.420]   and we will end up feeling exhausted, and we will strive and strive and strive, thinking
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.740]   that we can fix it.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:42.660]   And Jesus is like the burning bush saying, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.580]   and I will give you rest."
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.300]   Amen.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.300]   Would you stand with me?
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:53.340]   I would love to pray for you.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.580]   Would you just be comfortable if this has been helpful for you this morning, just to
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:00.780]   open your hands?
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:09.940]   Father, we just are grateful that in this moment we get to stand before you, and we
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.660]   get to stand before you just as we are.
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.620]   No pretense.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.500]   No trying to pretend.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:24.620]   Not trying to fix ourselves or make ourselves any better than we are.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:32.620]   Lord, I thank you that your invitation was to all, not to a certain few or a select few.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:40.540]   Father, I want to pray for each person here in this room where they came in today feeling
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:50.740]   exhausted, weary, burdened, with the pressures of the world on their shoulders.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:54.860]   Lord, we know that life is challenging and difficult.
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:39:01.540]   Lord, we understand that life is not easy, and that you don't promise us a perfect, easy,
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.140]   suffering, free life.
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.900]   But when you said to the crowds, "Come to me if you're weary and burdened, and I will
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.780]   give you rest, I'll give you rest for your soul," you say.
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:16.100]   Lord, that's the rest that we truly need.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.220]   And we're thankful for holidays.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.220]   That's great.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.540]   We're thankful for days off.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:21.540]   They're needed.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:26.140]   But what you're talking about in this passage is not Sabbath, but Shalom.
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:31.220]   What you're talking about in this passage is not a break from work, but a releasing
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.540]   of the striving in work.
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:39.180]   And so Lord, for every single person here who recognizes that they've been operating
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:47.940]   out of an orphan spirit, that their striving is related to their ability to be accepted,
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.780]   to be loved, to be someone.
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:57.380]   Lord, would you forgive us where we look to the world to give to us what only you can
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.340]   provide for us?
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:05.700]   A new identity as sons and daughters, children of God, ones who are able to cry, "Abba,
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:11.540]   Father," where the orphan spirit no longer is upon us, but the spirit of life and life
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.540]   abundant.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:18.420]   For you have not come to kill and destroy, to make shame, to make us feel weary and burdened,
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:23.780]   but you have come to give us life and life to its full.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.820]   So if you are sensing that weariness, if you're sensing that burden, would you just open your
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.060]   hands before the Lord?
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:41.500]   I want to pray that the Spirit of God would minister to you personally, directly.
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.580]   And I feel like the Holy Spirit is wanting you to be honest with him this morning about
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:50.140]   what it is that you recognize you're currently yoked to.
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:54.220]   And as I was saying earlier, look, there's nothing wrong with churches.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.220]   They're great and we want you to love your church.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:59.380]   There's nothing wrong with relationships, they're needed, and we want you to love the
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.620]   people in your life.
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:05.380]   There's nothing wrong with a great job and success and working hard and earning good
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.380]   money.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.420]   Nothing wrong with any of that.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.500]   But when those things become the thing that we are yoked to, that's the thing that Jesus
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.500]   has an issue with.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:18.040]   He's like, "The only thing I want you to be yoked to is me.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.380]   Because when you're yoked to me, my yoke is easy.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.860]   It's well fitted to you.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.100]   It's not going to be a burden.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.300]   There'll still be some weight.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.620]   There'll still be some challenge, but it's not going to be overwhelming.
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.620]   You're not going to be exhausted.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.940]   You're not going to be burnt out for I will be carrying the heavier load and we will be
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:38.540]   partnering together in the renewal of all things."
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.460]   So Lord, I want to pray for a renewal of work amongst the people in this room, not a desire
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:49.820]   to escape it, to cease from it, a desire to escape the world and to fall into a place
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.820]   of rest.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:58.020]   I want to pray for a movement of God's people out of rest into the renewal of work and life
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.020]   ahead of them.
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:03.260]   I want to pray that the Great Commission and the Sermon on the Mount would be a joy in
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:09.780]   our hands, that the gospel would feel light, not a burden, but a burden that is light,
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:13.660]   that we would recognize that in all that we do, whether it's a banker or a lawyer or a
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:19.580]   teacher or a nurse or a doctor or a homemaker, a domestic helper, whatever it might be, even
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:27.100]   if we're not currently working right now, we are partnered and yoked with Jesus.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:32.580]   And that in that we find new liberation in life for the glory of His name.
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.140]   So it is come Holy Spirit, come.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:39.580]   So I want to encourage you just to receive what the Spirit of God has for you here this
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.580]   morning.
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.500]   And as you receive it, we're going to worship together as a community before Him.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.500]   [music]
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:44.500]   [music]
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:54.500]   [music]
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:59.500]   [music]
