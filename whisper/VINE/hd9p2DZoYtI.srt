1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,120
 So, about six months into being senior pastor here at The Vine in 2013, I had what could

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,360
 only be described as a full on panic attack.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,720
 I woke up one morning and immediately as I opened my eyes, it felt like a tsunami of

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,000
 fear and of anxiety was just flooding over me.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,920
 I was lying there in bed and the whole room around me was just beginning to spin.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,240
 I was so hot.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,720
 My heart rate was pounding and I was sweating all over despite the fact that the air con

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,160
 in our room was just blasting out.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,680
 I felt completely out of control.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,080
 I wondered whether I was going to be able to catch a breath and what was going to happen.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,640
 I managed to just get out of my bed and literally just stumbled towards the bathroom, whereupon

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,280
 I kind of opened up the toilet and I was sick in the toilet.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,960
 I threw up literally in the toilet.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,080
 In that moment, I felt like this overwhelming sense of fear, almost to a degree like paranoia,

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,040
 like everything that I was trusting, everything that I was hoping in, everything seemed to

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,240
 be shattered in that moment.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,640
 I didn't know what was going on.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,680
 I didn't know how to find my feet again, how to find that ground again.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,040
 I was there on the bathroom floor.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,520
 I began to understand what was taking place.

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,940
 This panic attack wasn't just a random thing, but it was the result of so many months of

22
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,600
 bottling up how I was feeling.

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,880
 I realized that this was connected to my role as senior pastor here at the Vine.

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,360
 I had been struggling for months up until that point with a huge amount of self-doubt

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:44,520
 in my life, a huge amount of anxiety, self-doubt, and insecurity in who I was.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,120
 I knew that God had called me to be senior pastor here at the church.

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,440
 I had been so wonderfully prepared by our elders, by John and Tony, our founding senior

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
 pastors here.

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,600
 I was ready on paper to step into this role.

30
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,280
 When I stepped in on that day in November 2013, I had all those prayers, just like we

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,160
 prayed for Elizabeth just a minute ago.

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,880
 I felt this wave of just God's Spirit in me.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,000
 But it's so fascinating how quickly that was drained from me as I began to focus on my

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,840
 lack or my inability to do the thing that God had called me to do.

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,000
 I was putting so much of my energy in those few months to pretending on the surface in

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,920
 front of everybody, standing in front of you every week that I'm this great pastor, that

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,880
 I've got it all together, that everything's going to be great.

38
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,280
 Whereas inside, I was dying.

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,080
 Inside I thought I was a failure.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,320
 Here was the main thought that went through my head in that first six months.

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,160
 John and Tony had done such an amazing job of building such a strong, well-established,

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
 great church.

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,360
 And here I was now with that whole church on my shoulders, all that expectations and

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,760
 all that pressures.

45
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,720
 And I thought, "What if I'm the guy who 12 months down the line, the church goes from

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,560
 the size it is and it reduces down to like a hundred or so people?

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,960
 What if I'm the one who actually fails in leading this church?

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,000
 They've done such a great job and now it's on my shoulders."

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,920
 And I felt like I wasn't up to the task.

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,840
 And that wave of tension in me between living two different lives, a secret life of anxiety

51
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,120
 and insecurity that no one knew about, and a public persona that I had everything all

52
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,600
 right and that I was doing fine and that I could lead this church.

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,560
 Those two things created in me such a tension that on that morning, it just exploded in

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
 me.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:34,160
 Well, for the next number of days and the weeks ahead, I found myself thinking to myself,

56
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,780
 if people spend enough time with me, they'll realize that I'm completely out of my depth.

57
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,680
 And so what that made me do was begin to slowly at first and then quickly withdraw myself

58
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
 from people.

59
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,120
 I began in my trauma of the insecurity and anxiety that I was feeling to step away from

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,200
 people, kind of wall myself off.

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,440
 I thought if I can just create my own little private sense of some false sense of security

62
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,720
 and comfort by walling others away from me, maybe I can get control again.

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,160
 And so I began to distance myself from close relationships that had a strain on my marriage.

64
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,840
 I began to distance myself from people that I was supposed to be ministering to, from

65
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,200
 social settings.

66
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,120
 I didn't want to spend time with people because I thought if people would spend time with

67
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,440
 me, they would actually know that I am the failure, that I am the one that I thought

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,840
 deep down inside I was.

69
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,800
 And I was carrying that tension with me, isolating myself from my community, and it eventually

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,000
 just kind of boiled over.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,600
 There was one evening where the tension was so strong that I was like, I have to tell

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
 my wife, Chris.

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,600
 Like, I have to let her in to this pain.

74
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,680
 I can't carry the pressure anymore.

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,000
 I took her out on a date night.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,480
 It wasn't the kind of date nights that normally you would expect.

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,760
 I took her out for this meal and we sat down.

78
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
 And it was this public restaurant.

79
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,480
 And as soon as we sat down, I just started to weep.

80
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,040
 You know those moments where you don't plan to cry, but you suddenly just start weeping

81
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
 in this public space?

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,920
 And I'm just, I'm like a grown man weeping.

83
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,280
 And I can't control myself.

84
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,720
 And Chris is sitting there kind of going, "What is going on?"

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,680
 And I got the courage to say to her, "Honey, I'm really suffering right now.

86
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,440
 I'm sinking in the pressure of leading this church.

87
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,600
 I don't think I can do it.

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,160
 I don't think I've got the strength or the skills.

89
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,880
 I don't think I'm a very good pastor."

90
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,600
 I began to give her a list of all the things.

91
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,480
 And the biggest thing that was scaring me was that if I failed, everybody would leave

92
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,200
 and desert me.

93
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,920
 And I said to her, I said, "Honey, if I fail with leading the vine, if the church dies

94
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,280
 and disintegrates under my leadership, will you still love me?"

95
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,800
 That was how insecure I was.

96
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,000
 I thought that her love for me was based on my success and my achievements.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,360
 And Chris, in the beautiful way that only she can, leant forward, put her hand on my

98
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
 hands.

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,920
 And she says, "No matter what happens in your life, Andrew, whether you have great success

100
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,600
 or great failure, I will never stop loving you."

101
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,280
 And then she said, "But you cannot do this alone.

102
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,400
 You cannot do it in isolation from others.

103
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,360
 The thing you actually need the most is the thing that you're walking away from, that

104
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,400
 you need to come out and be known.

105
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,720
 You need to let people know how you're feeling.

106
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,640
 The church will support you.

107
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,880
 We're here for you.

108
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,080
 And that half of what you think is going to happen is not going to happen anyway."

109
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,040
 She started to comfort me with a challenge to not isolate, but to embrace the people

110
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
 around me.

111
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,240
 Well, that evening was a turning point for me.

112
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,760
 And I've been on a journey of healing ever since.

113
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,960
 It's seven years in.

114
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,280
 I think I'm still on that journey of healing, although I've learned so much and I've grown

115
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
 so much.

116
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,280
 And you may wonder, one of the things that I think I'm known for in leadership is my

117
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,520
 authenticity and my vulnerability.

118
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,200
 That's not come just because I've tried to do it.

119
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,480
 It's come because I've had to reach deep inside of me and be courageous in being known in

120
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
 front of you.

121
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,280
 I realized that I cannot carry the burdens of this ministry on my own.

122
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,360
 And so I bring them to you regularly as a church, as a way of me saying, "I will not

123
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,200
 isolate myself."

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,660
 That actually I think it's in community.

125
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,040
 It's when we're courageous enough to truly be known in our brokenness and our hurt and

126
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,080
 all the things that we're struggling with, that we actually can find the greatest moments

127
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,400
 of our healing.

128
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,880
 Some of you watching this right now, you've isolated yourselves from people around you.

129
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,680
 You've walled yourself off thinking that that's the place to find your comfort and security.

130
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,480
 And I want to speak a message to you today.

131
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,940
 If that's you, because it's been me and it still is me at some times, if that resonates

132
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,880
 with you, I want to call you once again into a place of being known by the people around

133
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,160
 you.

134
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,320
 Ask any psychologist, ask any sociologist, anthropologist, they'll tell you the same

135
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
 thing.

136
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,820
 They'll say that no one ever grows, transforms, changes, or develops for the positive in isolation

137
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,820
 from others.

138
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,520
 In fact, like I experienced in my own life, the opposite is true.

139
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,680
 Some of the greatest moments of breakdown in our physiology and our psychology happens

140
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,320
 because we isolate ourselves from a community around us.

141
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,680
 If you're willing to put yourself into a place where you're open and vulnerable with people,

142
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,600
 where you can truly be known by them, where you can grow in the safety and security of

143
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,640
 their friendship and love, some of the greatest moments of growth and flourishing will happen

144
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,920
 to you.

145
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,760
 But cut those things away.

146
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,160
 Wall yourself off.

147
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,000
 Retreat because maybe you're embarrassed or ashamed, or maybe something's happening and

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,360
 trauma in your life to such a degree that it makes you shut down.

149
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,200
 Do that and you'll find yourselves moving in the opposite direction of growth, change,

150
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,360
 and transformation.

151
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,360
 Here's the great irony of trauma.

152
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,680
 Trauma does its very best to remove, to kind of take away community from you.

153
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,920
 And the tension and irony is this.

154
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,960
 When you need community the most is when you actually feel like you desire it the least.

155
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,600
 When we're so overwhelmed with trauma, when we're so overwhelmed by the pressures of life,

156
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,960
 that's when we actually need to reach out towards others.

157
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,680
 But it's the time where we desire it the least.

158
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
 We want to walk in the opposite way.

159
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,680
 I think this is one of the greatest strategies of the enemy over us.

160
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,120
 We isolate ourselves when times are tough.

161
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,760
 I think over 2020, we all did this to a certain degree.

162
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,120
 Look, we all had to physically distance each other.

163
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
 And that was an important thing.

164
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,800
 It was the right thing as part of the pandemic that we've been going through.

165
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,880
 But alongside of physical distancing came something else.

166
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,000
 I call it social distancing, not the way that people used to promote social distancing.

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,080
 I think it's okay to physically distance with this pandemic.

168
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,400
 But what's come alongside of that is a desire in us to actually begin to distance ourselves

169
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,840
 emotionally from those around us.

170
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,920
 Beginning to distance ourselves, not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually

171
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,960
 from the ones that mean the most to us in our lives.

172
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,360
 We found ourselves with this growing sense of social anxiety during this time, where

173
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,960
 we don't want to catch this disease.

174
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,280
 And if someone's caught the disease, there's suddenly like a little bit of an outcast in

175
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
 society.

176
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,080
 Don't go near that person because you might get infected.

177
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,080
 And here's a phenomenon that's happened during the time of 2020.

178
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,360
 Did you know statistics show that divorce has arisen much higher in number than at any

179
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
 time prior to the pandemic?

180
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,680
 Because here's the reality.

181
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,000
 People know what it's like to live in their marriage, just basically doing surface things

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,700
 with their partner throughout the week.

183
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,360
 But you throw them 24/7 in a house together where they can't leave, and tensions have

184
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,620
 begun to emerge.

185
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,820
 This is a challenge to us because I think when times are tough, when things are stressful,

186
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,340
 when things are hard, we begin to grate against some of those relationships in our lives.

187
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,300
 We're going to find it hard to actually connect with people.

188
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,500
 We find it hard to express the emotions and be honest about what we're going through.

189
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,700
 And so we actually put up a front and we get angry and irritable and begin to rub against

190
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,980
 each other in the wrong way.

191
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,400
 And so we naturally distance ourselves or we begin to upset.

192
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,100
 Some of you watching this, you know this.

193
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,340
 Your marriage is in maybe the hardest place it's been in for many years.

194
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,260
 Some of you know this because of your workplace.

195
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,900
 You found you've got breakdowns in relationships in your work.

196
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,500
 I think for us here in Hong Kong, it's magnified because of everything we've been through in

197
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,460
 the last two years politically in the city.

198
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,860
 Not only have we had this pandemic, which has caused us at times to have fractions and

199
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,940
 frictions with our closest people that we're in relationship with, we've also got all this

200
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,420
 political anxiety and all the change that's happening here politically and everybody's

201
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,220
 opinions and thinking about that.

202
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,300
 And the way that that has also deeply divided our families, deeply divided us from our relationships

203
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:48,740
 deeply created issues for us, perhaps with those that we've come to love the most.

204
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,900
 I want to speak this over us as a church.

205
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,060
 I believe as we enter into 2021, we have a great opportunity right before us.

206
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,420
 It's been prepared by the Holy Spirit for this moment in this hour.

207
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:04,780
 And the opportunity is this, that we would actually see that trauma could be a catalyst

208
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,940
 towards a deepening of the most important relationships in our lives rather than a fraction

209
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,660
 and a division in them.

210
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,300
 That maybe actually post-traumatic growth might say to us that actually it's in traumatic

211
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,700
 experiences where we can have a wake up call and realize that we need to actually reach

212
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,500
 out and beyond, even though it feels like the last thing we want to do, that actually

213
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,220
 maybe the right thing to do is to actually open ourselves up and be known and honest

214
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,820
 about all the things that are in our lives, because we need to have that healing that

215
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,380
 can only come through being deeply in relationship with others.

216
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,380
 The research through post-traumatic growth has suggested that often people who have gone

217
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,220
 through crazy traumatic times prior to the trauma, they put relationships pretty low

218
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,500
 down on the list of things that were important.

219
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,960
 Maybe at the top was work, maybe it was career, maybe it was making money, maybe it was doing

220
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,800
 projects and putting in success, but right in the middle of their trauma, they realized

221
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,060
 that actually the relationship that they suddenly needed the most were distant from them because

222
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,780
 they had pushed those relationships away.

223
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,620
 And that actually trauma was an awakening time for them to realize that as they came

224
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,580
 out of that trauma, they needed to double down on the most important relationship in

225
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,780
 their lives.

226
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,220
 One of the people that was interviewed recently said it this way, he said, "I came out of

227
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,880
 trauma realizing that it's people over projects."

228
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,220
 My good friend Josh, that we've been talking about a little bit in this series, I think

229
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,180
 manifested this so powerfully.

230
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,940
 Josh had always been someone who put people over projects, but his trauma of the two years

231
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,860
 of his journey with cancer put himself in a realization that actually the relationships

232
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,100
 around him were the most important thing.

233
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,020
 And he invested so beautifully and so heavily in those important relationships, even ones

234
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,540
 that were quite strained became renewed and rejuvenated through the work of the Spirit

235
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,340
 in the midst of his trauma.

236
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,340
 And I know that just before he passed away, one of the things that he was so proud of

237
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,340
 was how deep his marriage was, how deep his relationships was with his parents, how deep

238
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,780
 he was in terms of reconciling some of the broken relationships he'd had in his life.

239
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,980
 It was a joy to him to find community in the midst of trauma.

240
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,300
 Jesus understood this better than anyone.

241
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,220
 Jesus understood that there was a powerful connection between trauma and healing that

242
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,100
 could only come through community.

243
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,000
 And I want to actually just share a story from Scripture today that draws out the beauty

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,620
 of what it is to find community in the midst of our trauma.

245
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,980
 And that community could actually be a catalyst for us for our greatest amount of healing

246
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,620
 and growth as human beings.

247
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,820
 I want to take this story from Luke chapter eight, and I'm going to start in verse 40.

248
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,580
 Let me read this to us.

249
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,380
 Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him for they were all expecting him.

250
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:58,460
 Then a man named Jairus, the ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus's feet,

251
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,340
 pleading with him to come to his house because his only daughter, a girl of about 12, was

252
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,980
 dying.

253
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,460
 As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.

254
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,780
 And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for 12 years.

255
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,740
 No one could heal her.

256
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,340
 She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak and immediately her bleeding

257
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,340
 stopped.

258
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,900
 "Who touched me?"

259
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,700
 Jesus asked.

260
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,460
 When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing around

261
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,460
 you."

262
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,580
 But Jesus said, "Someone touched me.

263
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,440
 I know that power has gone out from me."

264
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,140
 Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his

265
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,480
 feet.

266
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,000
 In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she was now

267
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,180
 instantly healed.

268
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,900
 And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you.

269
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
 Go in peace."

270
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,980
 Luke recounts for us this moment.

271
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,180
 It's kind of just a random moment in Jesus's ministry.

272
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,700
 He's just walking and ministering in the crowds of Galilee.

273
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,980
 And I think every day he had requests and people coming to him, asking him for all sorts

274
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
 of things.

275
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,460
 And here's Jairus saying, "Hey, would you come to my house and heal my daughter?"

276
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,180
 Jesus walking on the way to do that.

277
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,160
 And a woman who has been subject to bleeding for 12 years, she comes forward, she pushes

278
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,460
 her way through the crowd.

279
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,180
 She reaches out and just grabs the hem of Jesus's garment.

280
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,340
 And immediately, instantly, she's healed.

281
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,800
 Luke describes a few things about this woman.

282
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,740
 He says that she had been subject to bleeding for 12 years.

283
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,060
 Now it's not specifically stated in the text, but this is likely to be a uterine hemorrhage.

284
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,340
 It was a relatively embarrassing, relatively shameful thing to have.

285
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,540
 And she had spent a lot of money trying to heal herself over that period of time, but

286
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,980
 nothing had helped her.

287
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,260
 Now the thing that's really important to know about this that's implicit in the text and

288
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:03,220
 not explained directly here in the words Luke uses, is that because of her bleeding, she

289
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:09,340
 was actually deemed to be unclean by society, both the Jewish and social society of the

290
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,340
 day.

291
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:16,940
 Her bleeding meant that she was ceremonially unclean, that anybody she touched and anybody

292
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,740
 who touched her would also automatically then be unclean.

293
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,660
 Now the way you get yourself from being unclean to clean again was actually a long process

294
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,460
 of religious ritual.

295
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,900
 It required the cleansing of you.

296
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,460
 It required all these prayers.

297
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,640
 It required you going before a priest and a priest anointing you and declaring that

298
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,380
 you are clean again.

299
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,500
 It wasn't an easy thing.

300
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,520
 And so if you were deemed to be unclean, all of society would stay away from you.

301
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,380
 They would distance themselves from you.

302
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,260
 They would say that this person out here is one that if we touch, we'd have to go through

303
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,260
 all that.

304
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,520
 So they would push that person away.

305
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,620
 You can imagine for this lady herself, she's been subject to this for 12 years.

306
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,660
 And not only is there shame in her own physical brokenness, the fact that she can't heal herself

307
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,940
 and stop the bleeding, but there's an even deeper and greater shame about the distancing

308
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,140
 that everybody's done around her.

309
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,740
 She's alone.

310
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,600
 She's cast out.

311
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,220
 She's pushed aside and her trauma is both the community leaving her, but also I believe

312
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,460
 her then distancing herself from the community.

313
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,060
 You can almost imagine her walling herself off and saying, "Well, if they're going to

314
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,020
 treat me like that, well then I'm just going to distance myself."

315
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,900
 And a hardness coming over her in that way.

316
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,080
 I mean, this is a woman who's had to carry this kind of trauma for over 12 years.

317
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,380
 And there's habits that have formed in her where she will never go out in a crowd.

318
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,300
 She will never find herself in public.

319
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:49,580
 She would retreat and live her own life separate and isolated from everyone else, except for

320
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,580
 this day.

321
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,640
 Because on this day, she hears that Jesus is coming past.

322
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,800
 And she's heard stories about Jesus.

323
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,140
 She's heard stories about his healing and his power.

324
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,580
 She's heard conversations that he's not just a rabbi, but a prophet.

325
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:10,200
 And despite the reality that she lives her life distant from others and avoids crowds,

326
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,540
 she fights her way through the crowd in order to receive the healing that she believed that

327
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,540
 she could receive.

328
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,120
 Notice, if she touched someone, they would become unclean.

329
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,940
 She would have had to fight her way, touching many people to get towards where Jesus was.

330
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,720
 Not only that, but she reaches out to touch Jesus, believing that someone so pure and

331
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,900
 so beautiful and so holy and so powerful as this rabbi, if she could touch him, he might

332
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:44,780
 be able to touch her and cleanse her and renew her and heal her and establish her again as

333
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,260
 a true person in her community.

334
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,380
 The courage to do this is unbelievable.

335
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:57,820
 I mean, the risk she took that day to fight through the crowd just blows my mind.

336
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,020
 This is like if somebody was like a COVID positive person and they were getting on the

337
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,580
 MTR in rush hour and they let everybody know around them that they were COVID positive.

338
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,400
 Can you imagine what the crowd would do to that person here in Hong Kong in this time?

339
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,280
 They would scream, there would be panic, everybody would move out of the way, nobody would want

340
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,180
 to get anywhere near that person.

341
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,780
 That's the woman here.

342
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,940
 She was risking the crowd, understanding that she was unclean and all the hostility that

343
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,940
 would happen.

344
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,260
 She was willing to risk that in order to touch the hem of Jesus's garments.

345
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:37,140
 The Bible tells us here that as she touched him, immediately she was healed.

346
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,660
 Look at this, immediately she was healed.

347
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,380
 Now this is really important for what's about to happen next.

348
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,260
 There's not a progress in her healing here.

349
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,900
 This is not like another time where Jesus spat on the mud and put it on the eyes and

350
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,460
 the person couldn't see properly and then he prayed again and suddenly they were healed.

351
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,940
 There's no journey in healing for this woman.

352
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,580
 She's immediately, the emphasis in the Greek is on the moment that it happened.

353
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,700
 It happened straight away.

354
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,960
 Twelve years of shame and trauma and ridicule immediately removed in the physical healing

355
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,220
 that she suddenly experienced in that moment.

356
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,980
 But this is important because of what happens next.

357
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,780
 Jesus stops.

358
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,540
 He knows that power has gone out from him and he says these words.

359
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,500
 He says, "Who touched me?"

360
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,220
 It seems like a pretty kind of like not that big deal of a statement, right?

361
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,820
 Like he's just like, "Who touched me?"

362
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,180
 But there were so many crowds around him, so many people pushing in on him that Peter

363
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,060
 goes, "What are you talking about, man?

364
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,060
 What do you mean?

365
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,060
 Look at everybody.

366
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,060
 Everybody's touching you.

367
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,300
 Everybody's pushing in on you."

368
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,860
 And he's like, "No, no, no.

369
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
 Someone touched me.

370
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,540
 I know power has gone out.

371
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,380
 Who touched me?"

372
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,940
 Here's what I think Jesus is doing in this moment.

373
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,140
 He realizes about this woman.

374
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,140
 He's the son of God.

375
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,500
 He knows exactly what's taking place.

376
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,980
 He knows everything about this woman.

377
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,900
 He knows how she's fought through the crowds and he knows how she's come out and touched

378
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
 him.

379
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:02,780
 And he's standing there and before the crowds, he's intentionally creating space for her

380
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,660
 to have the courage to come forward and be known.

381
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,380
 You see, Jesus could have turned around and said, "Hey, you lady, you who touched me,

382
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,620
 come forward."

383
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,100
 But he doesn't do that.

384
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,500
 He instead says, "Who touched me?"

385
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:26,820
 It's his way of saying to her directly, "Will you have the courage to make yourself known?"

386
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,820
 Now the woman didn't need to do it.

387
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:36,460
 She didn't need to come forward for her physical healing.

388
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,320
 It wasn't like she was still wondering whether she had actually been restored and maybe I

389
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,540
 should go forward just to get the fullness of my healing.

390
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,940
 The Bible had told us immediately she'd been healed.

391
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,500
 Just as anonymously as she had touched the garment and received the thing that she had

392
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,600
 come from, she could have anonymously then just walked away.

393
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,460
 She could have just escaped the crowd and gone in the other direction.

394
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,100
 And no one would have known other than Jesus that that would happen.

395
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:08,220
 There was no reason for her to step forward unless there was another piece of healing

396
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,420
 she needed to receive.

397
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,260
 Get this church, Jesus calls her out, not just because he wants her to receive her physical

398
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:21,580
 healing, but because he wants her to see and feel her social healing as well.

399
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,940
 Because it was her bleeding that had caused her to be cut out from the very crowd that

400
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,340
 she had just fought through.

401
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,260
 And in him saying, "Hey, come forward now," what he's doing is creating space for her

402
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,860
 to actually walk into a place where she can stand in front of that community and testify

403
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,020
 to the reality that God has actually cleaned her.

404
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:47,140
 That she has been restored by him into community.

405
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:52,500
 The Bible tells us that rather than walking in the other direction anonymously, she steps

406
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,540
 forward before Jesus.

407
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,260
 She comes and she falls at his feet.

408
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,060
 And in front of all the crowd, she tells everybody why she pushed through the crowd, why she

409
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,220
 grabbed the hem of the garment, the healing she had received.

410
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,540
 And she confesses it before everybody.

411
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,980
 She takes the great courage to be known.

412
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,980
 I think church, this is one of the greatest examples of courage that we have in the New

413
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
 Testament.

414
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,800
 Not only did she have the faith originally to touch the hem of the garment, but now she's

415
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,900
 decided to push through the crowd once more and stand before everybody and confess the

416
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:32,740
 ugliness of her trauma and the reality that she has been so hurt by everybody around her.

417
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,660
 And yet now the one who's healed her is in her midst.

418
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,580
 I want you to see how Jesus responds to her in front of everybody.

419
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,980
 First of all, he says, "Daughter."

420
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,540
 He addresses her daughter.

421
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,000
 There is no other time in the gospels where Jesus speaks to a woman and uses this title.

422
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,400
 This is the only example in all of the gospel stories that Jesus addresses a woman and calls

423
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,800
 her daughter.

424
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,640
 The word actually was an incredibly intimate word.

425
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,680
 It was a word that was only reserved and used for a father speaking to his biological child.

426
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,040
 Jesus stands in front of everybody and says, "You're not just somebody I know.

427
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,200
 You're not just a friend of mine.

428
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,280
 You're not a disciple even.

429
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,000
 You're intimately part of my family.

430
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,520
 I am so here with you.

431
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,560
 You're my daughter whom I love.

432
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,720
 With you I'm well pleased."

433
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,240
 A similar kind of thing that God said over Jesus at his baptism.

434
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,480
 Here's Jesus addressing this woman who has been so isolated by community for 12 years

435
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,000
 and he's saying, "You are in the middle of the most intimate community you could ever

436
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 have.

437
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,120
 Restoration in your relationship with your father, with me, with your God.

438
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,080
 You're my daughter."

439
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,400
 And then in front of everybody, he says, "Your faith has healed you."

440
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,600
 I think Jesus is speaking there of both her faith to push through that crowd right at

441
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,840
 the beginning, but also her faith to push through the crowd on the second time and stand

442
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,400
 before everybody and testify to her brokenness and her healing.

443
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:11,520
 The woman had the courage to be known and that faith healed her.

444
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,440
 And Jesus uses those words on purpose because he wants all the crowd to know that she has

445
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,200
 received both her physical and her social healing.

446
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,520
 That where they had to be distant from her before, they can now draw close.

447
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,800
 And where she, if she had slipped away from the crowd anonymously that day, would have

448
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:34,060
 continued to live a habit of isolation, she now was being challenged to stand in front

449
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:40,360
 of everyone and welcome people into her journey so that she could be healed, not just physically,

450
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,400
 but emotionally and spiritually in her community.

451
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:51,360
 Jesus was passionate about relationships and Jesus understood that healing was so much

452
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,880
 more than just physical.

453
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,640
 I want to speak to you right now in this moment.

454
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,400
 Where has it been in this last little while that you've been experiencing, all that we've

455
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,520
 been experiencing in this pandemic?

456
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,320
 Where have you begun to isolate and distance yourself from others?

457
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,200
 Where have you allowed your emotions that you're carrying at this time to wall you off

458
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,580
 from the people that you love the most?

459
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,320
 For those of you who are struggling in your marriages right now, where have you put up

460
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:23,640
 walls with your partner because of the intensity of what you guys have been going through together?

461
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,200
 Maybe I want to say this as well.

462
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,720
 I believe that there are some people watching this where there's a secret sin that's been

463
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
 going on in your life.

464
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,180
 A little bit like for me where there's the secretness of my insecurity and on the surface

465
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,480
 in front of the church, I was the best pastor I could be, but inside I was dying and that

466
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,480
 tension boiled over to a panic attack.

467
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,280
 I think there's some people watching this right now and that resonates for you.

468
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,200
 There's a secret sin.

469
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,400
 There's something that you're doing that nobody else knows about and it's hidden.

470
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,280
 And because of that, you've been ashamed of who you are.

471
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,520
 You're ashamed of what you've done.

472
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,600
 And yet I believe God's standing before you today like he did that woman.

473
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,800
 And he's saying, "Who touched me?"

474
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,240
 Are you willing to come out of the shadows and make yourself known?

475
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,600
 That you're healing, that you actually long for.

476
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,520
 You don't want to feel the way you do inside.

477
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,760
 You don't want to feel caught up and in battle in your spirit inside.

478
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,840
 You don't want to feel the panic and the anxiety and the shame anymore.

479
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,920
 No, you actually do want to be known.

480
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,320
 But remember what I said at the beginning, trauma fights to rip community from us.

481
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,120
 The irony is when we need it the most, we want it the least.

482
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,560
 That's how you're feeling right now.

483
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,680
 But I want to say this, God creates a space for you in his grace.

484
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
 It's a space for you.

485
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,800
 He's not going to force you, but he invites you to step into that space and say, "You

486
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
 know what?

487
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,600
 Not everything is right inside.

488
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
 You know what?

489
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,800
 I've been carrying some stuff that I am proud of.

490
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
 You know what?

491
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
 It's been hard lately.

492
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
 You know what?

493
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
 I've been struggling.

494
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
 You know what?

495
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
 I need help.

496
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,440
 I need to respond in some way."

497
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,680
 Today this message is a grace space for you.

498
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,640
 A chance for you to come out of the shadows and come into the light.

499
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,160
 To begin to repair some of the broken relationships around you by being honest and humble, being

500
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,880
 real and taking courage.

501
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,720
 It's going to require a lot of courage for you to do this.

502
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,240
 It's not going to be an easy thing, but we've got a lot of ways here at the Vine where you

503
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,880
 can receive the help that you need, where you can be reestablished and reconnected in

504
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
 the community.

505
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,600
 At five o'clock today, we have a group of pastors that every Sunday are prepared to

506
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,200
 pray and minister to you.

507
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,560
 They're available today.

508
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,200
 And maybe for some of you, that's a step forward.

509
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,800
 That's like you coming out of the crowd and going, "You know what?

510
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
 I need prayer.

511
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 You know what?

512
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
 I need help.

513
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
 I can't get through this on my own."

514
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,680
 For some of you, maybe it's the need for your community group to come around you.

515
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,640
 If you're in community group, maybe there's a community group leader who can stand with

516
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
 you and pray for you.

517
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,320
 I want to encourage you to reach out to your community group leader this week.

518
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,200
 If you're not in a community, but you want someone to come around you and pray for you

519
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:05,560
 here at the Vine and you're not available today to be able to do that, email pastoralcare@thevine.org.hk.

520
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,560
 That will open you up for one of our pastors to reach out to you, to connect with you and

521
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
 to pray for you.

522
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,080
 We have an amazing team of counselors here at the Vine called Oasis, who are loving and

523
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,160
 willing to stand with you and pray for you and to actually walk with you in counseling.

524
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,920
 When I eventually confessed to Chris how I was feeling and began to move into a place

525
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:30,400
 of that healing, I went into counseling for almost a two-year period, walking with a counselor

526
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,000
 on a weekly basis to receive the healing that I needed and the growth that I needed.

527
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,560
 Maybe that's part of your journey too.

528
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:43,400
 I want to pull all this together and I want to encourage you and challenge you by speaking

529
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,080
 something that I think is important for each one of us to understand as we draw this to

530
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
 a close.

531
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,720
 Let me say this over us.

532
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,960
 As we learn to walk together in open, broken and vulnerable relationships, caring for one

533
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,800
 another as we discuss our struggles and issues and rejoicing together in our victories and

534
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:08,160
 our healing, we are going to see personal growth in each one of us like never before.

535
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,280
 That's my heart for you, church, that you would grow out of the trauma that you're feeling

536
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:19,480
 in a way that you connect in a deeper level with relationships around you like never before.

537
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,340
 Like the woman in the story that we looked at today, will you hear God calling you out

538
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:31,720
 of the midst of the trauma that you're in right now and inviting you forward to be known?

539
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,320
 And will you, like the woman, step forward?

540
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,880
 That's my challenge.

541
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:45,360
 That's my offer to you today, to step forward into the arms of God's grace again and to

542
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,000
 be reestablished in those deepest relationships and to know that out of them will come the

543
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,520
 greatest amount of growth and healing from your trauma.

544
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,760
 Let me pray for us, church.

545
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
 Let's pray.

546
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,720
 Father, we just are so grateful for this moment.

547
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,880
 So grateful that we get to stand together as a fellowship and as a community.

548
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,360
 And Lord, we recognize that so often we do retreat from the amazing people that you've

549
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:19,160
 put around us, that so often in our anxiety and our stress and our trauma, we turn inwards

550
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,560
 rather than outwards.

551
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,920
 We recognize that we put up barriers and walls to keep people out at times.

552
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:32,560
 And Father, some of us have done that consciously and some of us do that subconsciously.

553
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,920
 But Lord, it creates a barrier from the thing that actually is going to provide the greatest

554
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,600
 amount of healing for us, the men and women that you've put in our lives to love us and

555
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
 care for us.

556
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:50,560
 And so Lord, we come to you in this moment, humble before you, realizing that in the midst

557
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:56,100
 of the crowd, you make a space and you don't force us.

558
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,840
 But in your grace, you say, "Will you step forward and be known?"

559
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,480
 And I know from my own journey, being known before, first of all, my wife and then being

560
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,160
 known before the church in the years ahead has been the thing that's really helped to

561
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,680
 strengthen my healing.

562
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,160
 And Father, I believe that's going to be the same for many listening to this today.

563
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,160
 Lord, where the enemy's had a strategy to keep things in the dark.

564
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,040
 Father, I want to pray over those particularly that are struggling with secret sin, with

565
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,440
 stuff that's going on in their lives that no one knows about, but is tearing them up

566
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
 inside.

567
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,120
 Lord, the enemy will create a strategy of shame and fear.

568
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,420
 Oh, what if people knew that they wouldn't be your friend anymore?

569
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,640
 And like that prayer I said to Chris, I said, "If I fail, will you still love me?"

570
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,780
 Those are the tricks that the enemy so often plays in our minds when we're dealing with

571
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780
 secret sin.

572
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:55,160
 Oh, if somebody knew this about me, they would never accept me ever again.

573
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,880
 Father, we stand against that in the name of Jesus.

574
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,440
 And we pray the love of Christ of every person watching this right now.

575
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,400
 And Lord, where the enemy would try to cut us off from one another.

576
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:12,380
 Father, we pray for a release of your Spirit upon your people, that anyone who's walking

577
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:18,120
 in darkness today would look up towards the light and would like that woman have the courage

578
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,200
 to take the risk to step forward this week.

579
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,040
 So that's where the pastor here at the Vine, their community group leader, maybe it's their

580
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,400
 spouse, maybe it's a prayer partner that they're comfortable with, but they're willing to step

581
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,600
 forward and reach out and say, "I will be known."

582
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,920
 So Father, we pray for the power of your Spirit to be at work for each person on that journey

583
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
 this week.

584
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,200
 And we thank you for the relationships you've placed around us.

585
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,400
 Lord, may they be great wisdom and strength and encouragement and power to us.

586
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,680
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

587
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,680
 Everyone says.
