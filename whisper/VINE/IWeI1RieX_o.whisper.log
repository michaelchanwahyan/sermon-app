[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   Jesus' name, amen.
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.920]   - Amen, let's hear it for Carla.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.840]   Thank you, Carla.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.800]   (congregation applauding)
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.040]   Well, good morning, everybody.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.040]   It's so good to be back here preaching at the Vine.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.080]   I think you may be aware
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.520]   that this is my favorite pulpit in the whole world.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.360]   I mean, not this piece of metal
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.600]   with a plastic on top for my iPad, nice as it is,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   but this is my home church, and as the phrase says,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.360]   there is no place like home.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.020]   But there's an even more unique reason
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.660]   why today is special.
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.000]   Yesterday was my golden wedding anniversary.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.700]   (congregation applauding)
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.540]   Yeah.
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.680]   Yes, Sandra and I have been married for 50 years.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.240]   Actually, 50 years and one day.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.600]   I know Sandra deserves a medal.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.080]   Go on, say it now, get it over with.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.960]   But remarkably, today's passage in our Ephesian series
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.400]   is all about unity in relationships.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.260]   It looks like we planned this all along.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.320]   Today, I'll be looking at relations
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.360]   between husbands and wives,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.060]   and obviously, you'll understand
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.980]   why I will concentrate on that rather a lot.
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.000]   I will look at relationships between children and parents
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.240]   and between slaves and masters.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.480]   But to get us going,
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.960]   I wanna talk about airport conveyor belts.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.840]   Now, those of you that follow us on social media will know,
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.360]   Sandra and I love travel.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.180]   But one thing always mystifies me.
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.120]   Why does it always take so long for our luggage to arrive?
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.440]   Everyone else's seems to get priority,
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.280]   even the times when we have priority label on ours.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.460]   We wait with bated breath,
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.500]   looking for ours to come up into the belt.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.160]   But have you noticed, all cases these days look the same.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.260]   So a few years ago, we started a habit
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.240]   of tying a red ribbon around our case
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.960]   to help us recognize it.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.440]   As an aside, we were at Heathrow Airport a few Decembers ago
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.400]   and were pleasantly surprised to see our case,
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.800]   complete with red ribbons,
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.080]   coming off the conveyor belt early.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.600]   Hallelujah, we said,
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.560]   feeling rather pleased with ourselves.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.880]   We went through customs
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.920]   and we're in Heathrow Terminal 3
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.660]   only to discover we had the wrong case.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.880]   Someone else had had the same idea.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.120]   Not only was their case pretty much identical to ours,
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.440]   but I kid you not, it had the same red ribbons.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.920]   Embarrassed, one hasty, red-faced U-turn later,
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.440]   we found the real owners.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.120]   Dare I say, relieved real owners,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.720]   as their case, unlike ours,
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.080]   was packed with expensive Christmas presents.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.160]   But conveyor belts around the world
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.460]   aren't always like Heathrow or Hong Kong.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.640]   And we've experienced some horror stories.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.920]   Conveyor belts breaking down,
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.160]   having to wait over an hour for our luggage.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.280]   Now, unfortunately, this sermon's come back to bite me
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.320]   because I wrote this and then last week
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.800]   we went to Seoul in Korea and guess what?
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.200]   The conveyor belt broke down.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.560]   Or airports that have just given up
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.640]   and they end up dumping the luggage on the tarmac
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.840]   for us to sort through, home a fan.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.040]   But there's a picture here.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.760]   Relationships can be a bit like airport conveyor systems.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.880]   The passage we're gonna look at today will show us
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.400]   that a marriage will run smoothly
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.560]   if the wife fulfills God's directions
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.920]   and is subject to her husband,
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.920]   and if the husband loves his wife as himself.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.900]   A family will run smoothly if the children honor and obey,
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.160]   and if the parents do not provoke their children to wrath
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.280]   but teach them about God.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.620]   The workplace runs smoothly
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.620]   if the employees do good work and follow instructions
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.240]   and if the employers treat the employees well.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.120]   However, if someone doesn't follow the biblical instructions
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.140]   the whole machine is impeded or stopped.
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.940]   The luggage, as it were, is left on the tarmac.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.560]   Now the key to realizing that we need to fulfill
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.040]   our places in life, whatever those places may be,
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.260]   as to the Lord, we will be seeing this in this passage
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.000]   that we are to fulfill those relationships as to the Lord.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.220]   That means we need to act as if we were
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.020]   in that relationship directly with God.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.080]   Now you probably don't look at your boss
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.500]   and think of him as God,
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.000]   nor do you regard your spouse or children
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.820]   or parents in that way.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.420]   Yet if we would look at them as to the Lord,
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.160]   no doubt we would find it easier
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.680]   to behave in a godly manner.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.760]   Let us make sure that we are not jamming up
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.040]   the conveyor belts of our lives.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.800]   But enough of conveyor belts, let's get on to the passage.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.560]   Wives, submit to your husbands as you do to the Lord.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.400]   Now all the guys are wishing this is the finish
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.000]   of the reading today, by the way.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.120]   Wives, submit yourself to your husbands
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.320]   as you do to the Lord.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.800]   For the husband is the head of the wife
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.920]   as Christ is the head of the church,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.080]   his body of which he is the savior.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.360]   Now as the church submits to Christ,
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.360]   so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.280]   Bad news, husbands, that's not the end of the reading.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.240]   and gave himself up for her to make her holy,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.720]   cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.840]   to present her to himself as a radiant church
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.840]   without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish,
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.400]   but holy and blameless.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.360]   In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.600]   as their own bodies.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.120]   He who loves his wife loves himself.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.680]   After all, no one even hated their own body,
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.400]   but they feed and care for their body
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.360]   just as Christ does for the church,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.800]   for we are all members of one body.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.960]   For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.920]   and be united to his wife,
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.880]   and the two will become one flesh.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.680]   This is a profound mystery,
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.760]   but I am talking about Christ and his church.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   However, each one of you also must love his wife
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.760]   as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.840]   Those first few words in this passage,
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.920]   wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands,
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.880]   are possibly the top sentence in the whole Bible
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.920]   to be taken out of context,
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   usually by men,
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.440]   men trying to force their wives
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.940]   into an ungodly and unbiblical submission.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.480]   Let me say right here and now,
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.720]   this is never okay, and this is sinful.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.160]   As a result, on the other side,
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.480]   it has been strongly resisted by women over the centuries
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.480]   and led to a high degree of controversy and conflict.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:31.920]   So what I wanna do now is attempt to put it into context.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.200]   Firstly, some background.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.840]   The Ephesians were familiar
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.240]   with the Roman social order of their day
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.640]   in which the husband had full authority
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.280]   over the wife and children and owned the slaves.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.360]   Slaves were ruled until they were freed,
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.740]   which may not happen.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.320]   Male children were under the father's authority
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.120]   until they became adults.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.360]   Women and female children
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.740]   were under the man's authority all their lives.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:12.380]   You'll notice that Paul did not try
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.640]   to change the social order,
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.240]   but he addressed the proper attitudes for living within it.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.240]   Now, while the social order today, praise God I say,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.000]   may be structured differently,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.100]   the principles, the principles still apply.
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.340]   But what I wanna do first, I wanna ask you a question.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.280]   If I use the word submission,
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.920]   what comes to mind?
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.920]   Maybe yielding, compliance, or even capitulation?
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.840]   But what if I told you
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.380]   that Jesus submitted himself to others?
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.760]   Philippians 2, five to eight,
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.280]   in your relationships with one another,
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.040]   have the same mindset as Jesus Christ,
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.320]   who being in very nature God did not consider equality
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.160]   with God something to be used to his own advantage.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.040]   Rather, he made himself nothing
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.880]   by taking the very nature of a servant,
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.520]   being made in human likeness,
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.320]   and being found in appearance as a man,
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.920]   he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.360]   Yes, even death on a cross,
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.280]   which we celebrated a few moments ago.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.880]   And what if I told you
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.680]   that Paul instructed followers of Jesus
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.960]   to submit to one another?
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.040]   Now, early in this chapter,
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.160]   Paul says in verses 18 and 21,
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.520]   the verse which precedes the first about submission of wives,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.400]   he says this in verse 18,
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.560]   but be filled with the Spirit.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.280]   And then in verse 21,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   submitting to one another out of reference to Christ.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:20.560]   So what I wanna do now is put this passage into context.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.480]   In verse 18, Paul is addressing spirit-filled believers.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.000]   And he is saying, in effect,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.600]   if you are filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.840]   you will, in verse 21,
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:45.720]   submit to Christ by submitting to each other.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.880]   And in submitting to each other,
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.960]   verse 22, wives, submit to your husbands.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:00.120]   And as part of your submitting to each other,
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.640]   in verse 25 onwards,
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.440]   husbands submit to wives by loving them
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.520]   as Christ loved the church.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.600]   But we have to realize,
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.000]   we have to recognize that submission
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.640]   normally carries with it a negative reaction.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   Have you ever thought of why that is?
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.160]   Why do we think of submission as negative?
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:37.000]   If Jesus modeled it and commended it,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.840]   if Paul instructed us to do it,
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.520]   if it's a result of being filled with the Spirit,
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.920]   shouldn't we actually desire it?
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:55.800]   Paul gave two reasons for wives to submit to their husbands.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.320]   Number one, Jesus is the head of the church,
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.840]   and the husband, as the head of the home,
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.040]   is head of the wife.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.760]   But look, and guys, this is important.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.680]   The apostles' instructions to the husbands
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:17.160]   were twice as long as those to the wives.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:23.280]   And the central theme of all of this was love.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.400]   (pause)
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:31.240]   This perspective presented a sharp contrast
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.240]   to Roman society where a wife
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.280]   was considered the husband's property.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:43.360]   A husband was directed to demonstrate his love for his wife
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.520]   by loving her sacrificially,
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.880]   just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.080]   And Jesus gave his all.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:02.440]   The well-being of the wife was to be of primary importance,
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.440]   just as Jesus suffered to provide the needs of the church.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.320]   The man was to care for his wife as he did his own body,
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.800]   even as the Lord loved the church.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:21.000]   What an elevated view of marriage Paul presented.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.440]   He went on to state that this relationship
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.840]   is a picture of relationship between Christ and the church.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:36.800]   What a responsibility that places on a Christian couple.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:43.920]   As I said earlier, some seem to assume
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.120]   that these biblical instructions to husbands and wives
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.120]   entitle the man to be domineering
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.440]   and require the wife to be subservient.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:02.200]   Such assumptions could hardly be further from God's intent
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.360]   for he values each soul equally.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:14.440]   My friends, submission is a choice.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.680]   The decision to yield one's will to another.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.640]   When Sandra and I do marriage preparation,
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.640]   we always point out that if a husband loves his wife
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.640]   the way that Christ loves the church
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.240]   and he gave his life for her,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:44.600]   a wife would have no problem submitting to him.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:46.960]   That's true.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:53.200]   A husband will love his wife as Christ loved the church
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.640]   and gave himself for it.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.840]   A wife would have no problem submitting.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.240]   I love the way the message,
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.480]   we don't read the message version very much in church,
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.680]   but it expressed it wonderfully to me.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.960]   Wives, understand and support your husbands
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.680]   in ways that show your support for Christ.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.720]   The husband provides leadership to his wife
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.880]   in the way that Christ does to his church,
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.840]   not by domineering, but by cherishing.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.280]   Just as the church submits to Christ
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.600]   as he exercises such leadership,
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.920]   wives should likewise submit to their husbands.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:38.800]   This, my friends, is the model for Christian marriage.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:44.960]   And look, I'm not pretending marriage is easy.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.480]   After 50 years, no, sorry, 50 years and one day,
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.480]   it is still not easy.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.480]   We are fallen creatures.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.840]   We are sinners.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.720]   However, if a husband and a wife will both submit to Christ,
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.480]   they're on the right track.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.760]   I have an omission that might shock you.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.880]   I've been married twice.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.960]   That's right, you heard it.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:30.800]   I've been married twice to the same woman.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   Let me explain.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.920]   When we were married on the 6th of July, 1974,
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.120]   at Sidcup Baptist Church in the UK,
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.280]   we would not have considered ourselves
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.600]   to be committed Christian.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:51.640]   Our priorities were elsewhere, home, family, jobs, sport,
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.720]   noticeably Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.360]   And didn't England do well last night, yeah.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.000]   Less than a decade later,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.680]   we recommitted our lives to Jesus Christ.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.840]   And everything changed for us.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.320]   Our priorities were turned upside down.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.680]   I had a new wife.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.160]   Sandra had a new husband.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.640]   And after 40 years later, we can say,
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.640]   there is no comparison with married life,
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.760]   with Jesus at the center, to that without.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.200]   To be fair, our marriage had been good.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.000]   But this was so much better.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.760]   I wanna pause now to pray.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.960]   I realize there might be people here today
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.280]   who've come here and you've,
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.520]   maybe you've got spouses that are not following Jesus.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.720]   I'd like to pray for them now.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.240]   I also know, because I pray for it quite a lot,
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.520]   there are a lot of people here today
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.000]   who are seeking spouses.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.600]   And yeah, I think this is better than Tinder, right?
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.120]   We're gonna pray, all right?
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.600]   So let's close our eyes and let's,
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.280]   if you're not in these categories,
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.080]   be praying for the people who are.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.760]   Those people who have been faithfully following Jesus,
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.640]   but their spouse is not at the moment.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.760]   We just pray for that spouse now.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.160]   Lord, we pray for the light of your Holy Spirit
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.680]   to come upon them.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.360]   Whatever they're doing now, they may be here in church,
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.760]   they may be at home, they may be watching online.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.800]   Lord, I just pray a conviction of the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.000]   And I pray in this place,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.080]   we will see,
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.920]   we will see a flood of people
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.000]   where one spouse is following Jesus,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.240]   become couples who are serving Jesus together.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.520]   And I wanna pray for every person here today
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.200]   who is single but doesn't want to be.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.360]   You've heard their heart.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.400]   Lord, I just pray
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.600]   we give this to you, we leave this at the foot of your cross.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.400]   Lord, I know I'm always trying to be a matchmaker.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.560]   Lord, I'm not very good at it, but you are.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.680]   Lord, I pray that you would just
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:40.400]   have your way, Lord, amongst our singles,
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.640]   singles in our society,
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.520]   and provide them with godly husbands and godly wives.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.440]   In Jesus' name.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.600]   Amen, I say amen to that, yeah, it's worth saying amen.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.640]   Now, Paul then moves on to instructions
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.160]   for parents and children.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.120]   He says this, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord."
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.120]   I think, again, we'd like the reading to finish there,
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:03.960]   wouldn't we?
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.000]   "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.240]   "Honor your father or mother,
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.080]   "which is the first commandment with a promise,
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.640]   "so that it may go well with you,
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.920]   "and that you may enjoy a long life on the earth."
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.320]   Fathers, and I think we can include mothers in this,
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.480]   do not exasperate your children.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.120]   Instead, bring them up in the training
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.680]   and instruction of the Lord.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.840]   Children were told to obey,
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.400]   because that was God's command.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.640]   They were also directed to honor their parents.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.680]   And by the way, those of us that have left home,
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.720]   that honor of parents doesn't stop
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.000]   the moment you leave home.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.920]   If you've got elderly parents,
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.280]   you're still told to honor your parents.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.640]   Honor goes beyond obedience,
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.040]   because it shows love and respect.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   Again, it's not very popular in our 21st century culture.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.800]   I'll do what I like,
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.440]   has become the culture of today.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.760]   But Paul gives us three reasons
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.120]   for children to obey their parents.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.040]   Number one, verse one, because it is right.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:25.920]   Verse two, because it is according to Scripture.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.520]   And verse three, because it is accompanied
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.480]   by a promise of blessing.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.840]   But what I wanna hone on in is Paul's statement this way.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.840]   Fathers, do not exasperate your children.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.400]   Obedience doesn't come naturally,
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.720]   so it must be taught by parents through discipline.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:55.120]   But if we discipline in a spirit of wrath,
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.040]   it will result in provoking our child to anger.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.880]   And we get this word exasperating.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.360]   I don't know how many times you use that word,
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.840]   it's not in a common Linguist language.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.560]   But to exasperate is to frustrate someone intensely,
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.520]   to make something feel futile,
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.680]   to provoke them to push their buttons.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.080]   The Greek word literally means
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.840]   to make angry from close beside.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.840]   Now the point of both of these verses is clear.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.720]   While we are in authority over our children's lives,
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.280]   that authority is not absolute.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.000]   We are bigger, we are more powerful.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.160]   We can sin against them.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.800]   We have louder voices.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:47.960]   We have an adult mind, experiences, and vocabulary.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.560]   And as a result of all that, God in verse four
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.640]   commands us to examine ourselves.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:59.320]   We are not to use our authority haphazardly
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.160]   or in a way that injures them.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:09.120]   Given what exasperation is not, what exactly is it?
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.000]   Well, I've come up with a list of ways
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.600]   that parents can exasperate their children.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.280]   This is one that I observe here in Hong Kong and elsewhere.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.800]   The first one won't surprise you
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.120]   is to have a favorite and let it be known.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.800]   I need to say favoritism by a parent or a grandparent
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.960]   is painful.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.800]   We have two sons and five grandchildren
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.440]   and people always ask us the question,
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.840]   which one is your favorite?
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.440]   I say all of them.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.520]   But don't we show it sometimes?
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.240]   You know, you got two kids, one gets grade A's,
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.400]   the other one gets grade C's.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.760]   Show that you love the one, gets grade A's the most.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.200]   Or that one gets picked for the school team.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.840]   We're not to have favorites.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.200]   On the other hand, scolding.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.920]   We see this a lot, don't we?
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:16.680]   Rather than taking action, scolding is loud, demeaning words.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.160]   I have to say, scolding over a long time injures a child.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.920]   Number three on the same lines really,
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.600]   being extremely inconsistent in discipline.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.320]   All of us are inconsistent,
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:38.040]   but to fly off the handle without a plan is unfair.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.680]   When we make up the rules on the spot
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.560]   and enforce them when we feel like it, it is also unjust.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.240]   And that really links to number four, anger out of control.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.000]   Anger is really at the root of many of these sins.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.480]   We must get it under control.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.000]   Disciplining out of anger is totally wrong.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.600]   Fifthly, not being willing to ask forgiveness.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.680]   We can give the impression to our children
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.880]   that we are never wrong.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.960]   If your parents hear today one word
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.840]   to put into your vocabulary, sorry.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:31.560]   Sinful words that attack their identity.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.640]   We've all heard it, you're a failure.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.280]   You'll never amount to anything.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:42.000]   Words that attack their identity are satanic and wicked.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.160]   Andrew spoke about this last week, didn't he?
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.720]   Words that were spoken over him by a school teacher
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.600]   36 years ago took root.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.360]   He's dealing with it now.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:03.240]   Number seven, being emotionally distant.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:08.240]   Individuals can withhold affection
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.920]   or salt to get their own way.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.800]   Rather than talking about a conflict outright,
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.560]   they tend to withdraw when they get on their devices.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:24.040]   Number eight, pushing for achievement beyond reason.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.200]   Are we any tiger moms or tiger dads here?
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.320]   Crazy Rich Asians, you like that one, I loved it.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.600]   As parents, we are called to encourage
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.240]   and challenge our children.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.440]   But we need to realize their capacity.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.200]   We can be too demanding and never satisfied.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.920]   Number nine, being overbearing,
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.160]   overprotecting or domineering.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.000]   Children need to grow into being their own person.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.600]   When our words, our will, our personality
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.080]   constantly overrides theirs,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.280]   they will be rightly frustrated.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.400]   I love number 10, I see a lot of this in Hong Kong.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.400]   Nitpicking, nitpicking, constant critique,
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.040]   criticism of small things.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.760]   Wow, I think my observation in Hong Kong
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.360]   is that one of the things as parents,
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.400]   what we do is very rarely say, I love you, I'm proud of you.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.680]   We show our love by telling them
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.160]   the things they've done wrong.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.040]   We're not giving our child a feeling of acceptance,
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.160]   but pointing out everything that is wrong
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.320]   or could be improved.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.840]   Number 11, again, we see this a lot, comparison.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.680]   Children have different gifts and talents.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.680]   If we don't recognize those differences,
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.360]   but instead insist that they be like a sibling
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.000]   or ourselves or somebody else,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.560]   we are setting up for long-term anger.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   And of course, the last one is any sexual,
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.360]   physical, or emotional abuse.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:15.160]   Does that list convict you?
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.120]   It does me.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.440]   So I wanna pause and pray for our children now.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.040]   I'm gonna ask Sandra to come up.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.400]   Pray for our children,
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.840]   and let's use this to repent for our own shortcomings
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.320]   and pray for the children that God's given us
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.440]   in our families and in this church.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.400]   Let's pray together.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.240]   Close your eyes.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.880]   - Father, we just come to you now in this moment.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.800]   May we all say sorry.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:55.120]   Sorry, the things that have been accepted by us as children.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   Sometimes it's us saying sorry to the adults in our lives,
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.840]   but may we take that moment just to say sorry
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.080]   if any of these things reflect in our hearts.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.720]   I pray for the parents that we know
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.080]   that have said these things to us.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.560]   May we leave those things of hurts and wounds
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.040]   at your throne room now,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:23.760]   and help us to go forward for the children
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.080]   that we come across in our communities, in our families,
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:33.200]   that we can change our mindset to encourage them,
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.800]   to say that we're proud of them, that we love them,
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:40.200]   and have that moment that we can hear them speak to us
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.880]   and encourage us as we listen to them and vice versa.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:51.200]   The children are gifts to us for a season.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.040]   They're only with us.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.120]   They grow very quickly,
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.200]   and we want to see the best of the best
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.880]   of these children of humans that are given to us for a season
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.520]   but you knew them right from the beginning
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.640]   in the mother's womb,
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.440]   and we want the very best for those children.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:14.400]   And remember that we're all your children.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.520]   We're your sons and daughters that we wanna be guided
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.280]   and love unconditionally like you love us unconditionally.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.440]   Help us to love unconditionally.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.720]   Help us to have a mindset of change.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.880]   If we struggle in any of these areas,
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.040]   we ask that you help us go forward from today
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.080]   with a positive and a loving attitude in our lives
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.320]   to children, whatever age they are,
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.800]   whether they're young, whether they're growing up,
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.280]   whether they're youth, whether they're young adults,
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:57.280]   they all have and want that love to come from the parents
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.120]   and the communities that they're brought up in.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.960]   So Father, I just pray, Father, today,
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.120]   we honor you that you're our Father,
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.280]   and we want you to guide us afresh.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.840]   So bless everyone in this room
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.920]   and all the children that are out in Sunday church now
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.680]   that may they get the message today
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.600]   like we are getting the message from you,
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.520]   that you love us unconditionally.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.480]   Help us to love unconditionally and to put into others
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.680]   and replicate what you've given us
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.120]   in a positive attitude, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.360]   - Amen, thank you, Sandra.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:41.080]   So we've looked at submission between husbands and wives.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.160]   We looked at submission between parents and children.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:49.240]   And lastly, Paul addressed slaves and masters.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.960]   I wanna read it to you.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.440]   Verse five, "Slaves, obey your earthly masters
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.480]   "with respect and fear, with sincerity of heart,
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.500]   "just as you would obey Christ.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.740]   "Obey them not only to win favor when their eye is on you,
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.180]   "but as slaves of Christ,
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.820]   "doing the will of God from your heart.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.040]   "Serve wholeheartedly, as though you were serving the Lord,
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.460]   "not people, because you know that the Lord
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.660]   "will reward each one for whatever good they do,
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.580]   "whether they are slave or free.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:28.240]   "And masters, treat your slaves in the same way.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:32.860]   "Do not threaten them, since you know that he is both
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.920]   "their master and yours in heaven,
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.800]   "and that there is no favoritism with him."
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.680]   I think the principles that are outlined here
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:49.120]   can be employed, can be applied to employees
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.060]   and employers today.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:55.960]   So when it says servants, I think we can read employees.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.240]   They were to labor as if they were serving Christ,
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.880]   because that was and is God's will.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:07.880]   When you go into work tomorrow,
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.920]   serve as if you are serving Christ.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.840]   God himself would give the reward for such service.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.000]   And masters, employers, were challenged
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.720]   to remember the Christian principles
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.540]   and treat their servants, treat their employees
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:29.140]   with the proper attitudes and concern for their welfare
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.960]   and to avoid threats.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:35.080]   I think taking this whole lesson together,
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.480]   I think what the apostle Paul is actually saying,
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.440]   that Christianity brings unity
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.520]   and blessings in relationships
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:50.520]   by a change of heart, resulting in godly attitudes,
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.800]   and not by a change of social structure.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.320]   His desire was that the Ephesians would fulfill their roles
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.080]   as God had appointed them,
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.600]   and that the results would benefit both them and the gospel.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.080]   None of God's instructions were meant to be degrading.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.000]   Rather, they were and are a guide
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.680]   to living a blessed godly life.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.160]   God's direction for his followers
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:27.600]   are direct opposites of natural human inclinations.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.760]   Let me say it again.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:35.120]   God's direction for his followers
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.080]   and for their attitudes are direct opposites
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.120]   of natural human inclination.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:47.880]   A change of heart is essential
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.680]   to truly follow his commands,
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.680]   and then his power and his grace are necessary
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:58.280]   to apply his instructions to daily living.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.900]   Our workplaces are our mission fields.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.780]   You don't need to go to the ends of the earth
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.300]   to go on mission.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:17.660]   You are going on a mission tomorrow morning.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:23.380]   Our workplaces are ripe for the gospel.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.180]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.260]   I reach more people for Christ as a businessman
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.820]   than I do as a pastor.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:40.260]   I spend most of my time these days with Christians.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:45.300]   So what we're gonna do now, we're gonna pause and pray.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.300]   I want you to pray.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.140]   I want to get a picture of your boss.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.780]   You've probably not done that very much.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.740]   Your boss, your bosses, your colleagues at work.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.500]   We're gonna omit our shortcomings
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.980]   as representatives of Christ in the workplace.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:08.900]   We're gonna pray for God to really work through us.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:14.180]   If you're a boss here today, pray for your employees.
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:19.940]   You know, they will see Christ in you.
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:23.220]   They really will by the way you treat them.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.020]   Let's pray.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:26.860]   Let's pray.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:32.380]   Father, we thank you for the people you've given us.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:39.180]   For those of us that are employed or working,
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.860]   we thank you for our boss.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.420]   We thank you for our workmates.
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.660]   For those of us that are in a position of influence,
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.540]   Lord, we pray for those who are under us,
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.380]   our staff, our colleagues.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:57.380]   I pray that even tomorrow morning Lord,
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.100]   we're beginning of a new mission trip.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:08.460]   Lord, I pray that Lord,
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.860]   that you would just give us the right attitudes.
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:15.780]   Lord, that people would see Christ through us.
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.380]   Whether we're a boss or an employee.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.100]   And Lord, we repent of times in our lives, Lord,
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.380]   where we've shown the wrong attitude at work.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.980]   Where we've not represented you well.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.180]   Forgive us, Lord, and help us, Lord.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:39.300]   Help us, Lord, to be your soldier and servant
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.660]   in our workplace.
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:46.140]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.740]   As we come to the end of this today,
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.900]   I told you a lot of things you've got to do
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.900]   and you probably would say,
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.420]   look, it's too hard, can't do it.
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.660]   I cannot do it.
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.660]   And I got to say, you're absolutely right.
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.300]   All of these things I've been talking about today,
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.820]   you can't do.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:13.020]   But you got to remember that this passage
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:17.060]   comes immediately after the instruction.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.220]   And it is an instruction.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.100]   Not a suggestion.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.700]   By Paul to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.660]   When he says be filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.380]   it's a present continuous tense.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:32.820]   It means continually be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.340]   And I'm going to pray now for us, all of us,
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.420]   that we will be filled with the Holy Spirit today.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.780]   And that that Holy Spirit will work in our relationships,
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.340]   whether with our spouses, with our children,
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.900]   or our parents, or in the workplace tomorrow.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.500]   But believe me, you cannot do this on your own.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:56.540]   Holy Spirit needs to come and to fill us.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.100]   So as the worship band comes back, can we all stand?
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:08.900]   I realize that's quite a lot
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.140]   we've had to go through this morning.
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:17.220]   But I want to come before God now.
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:18.900]   And say, Lord, I need you.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.380]   I need you to fill me.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.100]   Just put your hands in front of you.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:29.820]   Lord, we are a church here at the Vine
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.860]   that believes your word.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.620]   We take you at your word.
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.820]   And even though in that passage today,
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.620]   there were some difficult phrases,
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:41.540]   some difficult things for some of our minds to comprehend.
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.580]   Your word tells us that how we can be filled
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.980]   with your Holy Spirit is to ask you.
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:50.700]   And we are your people, Lord.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.940]   As I look out in front of me,
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:55.500]   different faces, different races, different backgrounds.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:00.300]   Some married, some single.
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:04.300]   Some parents, some children, some neither.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.460]   And we are your people.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.780]   And we are your people.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.340]   Some children, some neither.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.860]   Some bosses, some employees.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.540]   What we have in common, Lord,
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.420]   is we need unity in our relationships.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.820]   It's what we've been studying in Ephesians
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.260]   these past few weeks.
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.700]   And I want to say, Lord, I cannot do this.
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.020]   I need your Holy Spirit.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:37.260]   So as we stretch our hands out, we say, come Holy Spirit.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.540]   Come and fill us afresh.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.620]   Guys, just bear with me.
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:44.940]   Just do this.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:46.660]   If you don't feel like doing it, just come and do this.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.940]   'Cause I think it's so important for us to do this.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.620]   Stretch out and ask God to come into our relationships.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.500]   I want to see better husbands.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.500]   I want to see better wives, better parents, better children,
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.340]   better bosses, better employees, but it can only be done
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.460]   with the empowerment of the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.540]   Don't you go from this sermon and say, must try harder
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:11.460]   and go home and try harder.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.300]   You will fail.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:16.660]   Oh yes, it'll work tomorrow and the day after possibly.
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.420]   But if you do it by must try harder, you're gonna fail.
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:24.300]   If you allow yourself to be captivated
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.940]   by the Spirit of God, if you allow yourself
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.700]   to be continually filled with the Spirit of God,
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.300]   I'm not saying it's easy.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.580]   But it's the only way.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:40.140]   Holy Spirit come, fill me afresh.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.420]   Fill us afresh.
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:51.060]   Fill the husbands here, the wives, the parents,
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.060]   the children, the bosses, the workers.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.340]   Fill us all with your Holy Spirit.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:02.060]   (gentle music)
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.660]   (gentle music)
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:14.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
