00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 A couple of Saturdays ago, I was having lunch with some friends,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,280
 and we were talking about our weekend plans.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,800
 One of my friends said, "I get really bad Sunday blues,"

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,800
 and explained that each week, as Sunday goes on,

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,520
 she gets more and more anxious about the work week ahead.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,360
 She asked, "Have you heard of Sunday blues? It's a real thing."

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,280
 I hadn't, so I looked into it,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,680
 and I learned that it's also called the "Sunday Scaries."

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,080
 My Google search took me to the Urban Dictionary,

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,920
 which is this crowdsourced online dictionary for slang or cool words,

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,720
 and it defines Sunday blues as,

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,400
 "When it is Sunday, you have school the next day,"

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,000
 presumably defined by a student.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,120
 There was a hyperlink on the word "Sunday,"

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,520
 and I thought, "Why does Sunday need defining?"

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,640
 So I clicked on it, and it defines Sunday this way.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
 "The last day of the weekend, and is usually ruined

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,600
 because of the thought of another dreaded Monday."

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,000
 Then Monday was hyperlinked,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,240
 and it calls Monday the most dreaded day of the week.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,920
 A study done in the USA revealed that out of 1,000 people,

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,680
 more than 8 in 10 people feel more anxious on Sundays

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,880
 in anticipation of Mondays.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,480
 And of these people, 95%, which is pretty much everyone,

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,360
 says it is related to work stress.

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,280
 So this means about 8 in 10 of you who are watching this live

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,960
 or watching it on Sunday,

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,920
 you are feeling some level of anxiety about tomorrow.

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,960
 And the stress isn't just felt by those who don't like work.

30
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,920
 Even people who love their work reported a sense of anxiety.

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,000
 Some said it's caused by expectations on their performance

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,560
 or caused by the high workload.

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,200
 Some are stressed by a relationship with their coworkers.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,520
 Even worse, some worry whether they will lose their jobs.

35
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,920
 And we know that this worry has just been worse by the pandemic.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,800
 Maybe you can relate to some of this.

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,360
 We know as well that for some of you,

38
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,680
 you want to be employed, but you aren't.

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,320
 And that is a huge source of stress in itself.

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,600
 It's important for you to know that God cares about this so much.

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,520
 The Bible has a lot to say about God's heart towards work

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,080
 and the purpose and meaning of work.

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,800
 You know, we spend so much of our time at work.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,520
 We spend actually about half our waking hours at work.

45
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,360
 And God wants to be part of your work.

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,920
 Because if God is only relevant to you in the 10% of your life

47
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,000
 when you engage with church everywhere or community group,

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,120
 but then absent from the 90% of what you do,

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,920
 then we live a very limited and compartmentalized faith.

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,200
 God is active in everything, in all areas of our life.

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,160
 And work is one key area where God wants to meet you and empower you for.

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,640
 What's really exciting for us here at The Vine

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,440
 is that this really is what the river is all about.

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,000
 The River Vision is about everyone being empowered to encounter God

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,480
 in all aspects of our life, in everything that we do,

56
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,200
 every day of our lives, Monday through to Sunday.

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,960
 River is about growing our personal relationship with God

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,240
 and being missional in the places where God puts us,

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,040
 where we are pouring out our talents, our gifts, our energy and time.

60
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,480
 This is why I am excited to announce to you today

61
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:45,760
 that we are launching a faith and work ministry called the Work Life Ministry.

62
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,520
 I'll tell you in a moment some of the plans we have for this ministry.

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,520
 But first, let's take a kind of high level overview of what God thinks about work.

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,240
 Is work even God's idea?

65
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,640
 If it is, why do we have these Sunday blues, these Sunday scaries?

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,560
 And what's the purpose of work?

67
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,680
 So let's define what we mean by work.

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,920
 When I talk about work, what I mean is energy that is purposefully used,

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,440
 whether it is physical or mental, whether it is paid or unpaid,

70
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,920
 to meet the needs of yourself, others or creation.

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,760
 So that applies to those of us who have a paid job,

72
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,560
 but it also applies to those who are involved in any unpaid or volunteer work.

73
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,040
 The energy spent here at the Vine volunteering,

74
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,080
 that is indeed included in what we're talking about today, too.

75
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,960
 It also applies to parenting, whether you're a full time stay at home mom or dad,

76
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,240
 or you have a job on top of parenting.

77
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,200
 Studying is also work, so it applies to students, too.

78
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,880
 And to understand what God says about work,

79
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,240
 let's start at the very first verse of the Bible.

80
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,720
 Genesis 1.1 says, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."

81
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,320
 So the Bible begins with God at work,

82
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,640
 with him using his energy purposefully to create, to bring about the whole creation.

83
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,320
 And we know that God works to create humankind,

84
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,400
 create us and to create relationship with us.

85
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,040
 He works to give us everything so that we can flourish.

86
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,480
 Later on the sixth day, Genesis 1.31 says this,

87
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,760
 "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good."

88
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,200
 It was like on the sixth day, God took a step back,

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,040
 reviewed his own work and thought, "This is not bad. Good job."

90
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,400
 There's a sense that his work brought him contentment,

91
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,720
 fulfillment, joy and satisfaction even.

92
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,920
 Then on the seventh day, God stopped and rested.

93
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,920
 So God himself limits himself to six days of work and one day of rest.

94
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,520
 So there's a limit and a rhythm to working and resting that we are called to observe.

95
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,600
 We can't just keep going, Alison.

96
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,720
 And because God created us in his image, imago dei,

97
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,960
 which means we are called to reflect God, we are therefore called to work.

98
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,560
 We are actually designed to work.

99
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,720
 Work is in God's original design and we aren't meant to be doing nothing.

100
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,040
 God designed work so that as we work in partnership with him,

101
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,400
 we feel that sense of fulfillment, satisfaction and we flourish.

102
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,120
 So what is our work meant to achieve? What is it meant to be for?

103
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,360
 Genesis 1.28 says this, "Be fruitful and increase in number.

104
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,920
 Fill the earth and subdue it.

105
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,360
 Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky

106
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,800
 and over every creature that moves on the ground."

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,320
 So we are called to have dominion, to govern under God's authority.

108
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,480
 These are words actually that describe how kings in the Old Testament are meant to govern.

109
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:19,120
 So we are mandated to act as kings over creation.

110
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,320
 We are expected to manage creation, to develop, to progress it,

111
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,040
 to care for it and to sustain creation.

112
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,040
 Then in Genesis 2.15 it says that,

113
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,880
 "The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and take care of it."

114
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,040
 So we are also called to serve humbly, to work with diligence,

115
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:49,280
 to work hard so that we protect, we guard and we keep what God has already started.

116
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,720
 The word work in Hebrew is related to the worship of God.

117
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,160
 So if we put these two things together,

118
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,960
 what that means is that we are called to define the world we find ourselves in,

119
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,400
 our culture, our society, to take the goodness of it, to keep it, sustain it

120
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,320
 and to also shape it into what God would want it to be.

121
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:21,560
 We are called to be diligent in our work, in what we do and also to care for people.

122
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,280
 And so God invites us to work as a steward of his creation, to bring about God's shalom.

123
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,320
 The shalom that means God's goodness, his peace, his wholeness,

124
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,840
 his flourishing in all areas of our lives.

125
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,360
 That includes ourselves, our relationship with others and in also what we do.

126
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,720
 So in work terms, what God has charged us to do through our products and services that we produce

127
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,960
 is that we serve others and we contribute towards the flourishing of his people, of his creation.

128
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,800
 And we do that out of a worshipful heart towards God.

129
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,120
 So God speaks about both the nature of work and the action of work.

130
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,160
 And what this means is that what we do matters, how we work matters.

131
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,680
 The way we do it matters, in the task that we do and how we treat others matter

132
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,160
 because it is meant to contribute to that flourishing.

133
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,120
 In this way, good work has both extrinsic and intrinsic value.

134
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,440
 It has extrinsic value because it brings some value to something or someone else

135
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,640
 and it has intrinsic value because work is good in and of itself.

136
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,760
 That sounds amazing, doesn't it?

137
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,320
 It's important to know that that is God's design and his heart for work.

138
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
 But we know in reality, work isn't quite like that.

139
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,000
 Work isn't always a complete source of fulfillment and joy

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,720
 because if it is, we wouldn't have those Sunday scaries.

141
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,320
 So why is that?

142
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,040
 Well, we know that the fall happened.

143
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,720
 Adam and Eve wanted to be like God and to know both good and evil.

144
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,040
 So they took things into their own hands, rebelled and sinned.

145
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,600
 And what this means is that Adam and Eve's sin brings punishment from God

146
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,840
 and this punishment is felt everywhere and has an impact

147
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:28,240
 on the most fundamental areas of their lives, including their work.

148
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,760
 The ground that they were called to take care of and steward

149
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,320
 will now produce thorns and thistles.

150
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 Work after the fall becomes more difficult, more challenging.

151
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,880
 It becomes a place of struggle as well as a place of joy

152
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,520
 and that's where the stress, where the anxiety comes from.

153
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,040
 And it's not only the work itself that becomes hard.

154
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,160
 Our own sinfulness means that we are prone to making work

155
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,920
 into something that God doesn't intend for it to be.

156
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,760
 Instead of seeing work as an avenue of service, of worship to God,

157
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,520
 we sometimes turn work into something that is purely for our own selfish good.

158
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,520
 Perhaps we wish that we can avoid work altogether

159
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,080
 or we can crave the wealth, the power, the status that a job gives us

160
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,560
 and we run after those things.

161
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,400
 The thing is those things in itself are not a bad thing.

162
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,280
 A good job brings money for us.

163
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,840
 It provides for our needs and for the needs of those who are dependent on us.

164
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,320
 It is a way actually that God provides for us.

165
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,400
 It's good and it's God ordained,

166
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,120
 but it becomes an idol if we use those things for our own advantage,

167
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,920
 maybe to fill our own worth or we base our identity on the wealth,

168
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,840
 on the power, on the status.

169
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,440
 Or if we choose a profession that we think is far more respectable.

170
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,320
 If as a parent you forced your children to choose certain professions over others,

171
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,960
 not because you think it is better suited to them,

172
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,320
 but because you think that that profession brings better stability

173
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,080
 or brings the family a higher status, it brings in more money,

174
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,320
 then we've taken God out of the equation of work.

175
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,840
 Idols in our heart ultimately don't fulfill and can leave us feeling hopeless.

176
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,560
 So it's very important to know that work itself is not the curse.

177
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:36,200
 It is the curse that came from the disobedience that caused work to be difficult.

178
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,760
 But God didn't leave us in that mess.

179
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,560
 God's intention all along is that his kingdom would come.

180
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,960
 We pray that in the Lord's prayer that Pastor Louise talked about a few weeks ago.

181
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,560
 The Lord's prayer teaches us to pray these words.

182
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:01,680
 "Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."

183
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,640
 This kingdom of God is the claim that God is the world's one true God,

184
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,360
 the one God who would reign and rule in a new way,

185
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,120
 that he would undo all the sin and the mess that we are in,

186
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,560
 that he would save us, rescue us, and undo all injustice in the world.

187
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,880
 It would bring peace to every part of our world.

188
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,360
 There would be no more hardship in what we do.

189
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,960
 That would be gone and there will be peace in our hearts.

190
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,360
 Shalom would be restored.

191
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,680
 And we see in the Old Testament that God chose a special group of people,

192
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,840
 the Israelites, to bring about this shalom.

193
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:49,120
 He chose them that through them the whole creation would experience this shalom.

194
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,520
 However, we know that they rebelled and sinned against God too,

195
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,400
 just like Adam and Eve, and this shalom didn't fully return to earth through them.

196
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:06,480
 So Jesus came to us and Jesus himself says that this kingdom of God had begun in him.

197
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,440
 Jesus says this shalom would come back through him.

198
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,800
 And what's really fascinating is that Jesus says that through him,

199
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,680
 life would be restored to what it was like before the fall.

200
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,520
 There would be an ease to life, to all that we do, to our work,

201
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,280
 just like the times before the ground was cursed.

202
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,640
 But Jesus didn't leave us with a finished kingdom.

203
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,280
 He didn't come and fix everything, did he?

204
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,880
 He died on the cross and his followers were left thinking,

205
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,760
 "Well, what about this kingdom? We don't quite see it."

206
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,920
 But what Jesus did through his death and resurrection

207
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,080
 was that Jesus opened up a way for us to partner with God

208
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:57,080
 so that us and God together, we would bring this shalom.

209
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,560
 And just as the nation Israel was chosen, we are all now the chosen people.

210
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,520
 We are chosen to bring about the kingdom of God.

211
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,560
 And one practical way God invites us to bring this about

212
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,640
 is through whatever area of influence he places us in.

213
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,040
 And work is one of those areas.

214
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,840
 In a crazy way, as we are empowered by the Holy Spirit,

215
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,600
 God is saying, God says to you, "You know, when you go to work,

216
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,680
 when you do your work, what I want to do is that through you,

217
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,720
 through your work, you bring my peace, you bring my shalom,

218
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,640
 my mercy, my justice to earth, to your team, to your company,

219
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,280
 to Hong Kong or wherever you're watching this,

220
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,160
 so that as you do that, you flourish, those around you flourish,

221
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,800
 your company flourishes and our city flourishes, creation flourishes again."

222
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,960
 That's a tremendous calling that every Christian has,

223
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,520
 that God would trust us and task each of us to do that,

224
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:09,000
 to bring his kingdom, his flourishing to the world.

225
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,320
 The thing is, this isn't going to happen if we go to work

226
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,280
 and we keep God out of our work box.

227
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,960
 If we leave God at church on a Sunday,

228
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,080
 if when you finish watching today, you say, "See you next Sunday, God."

229
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,400
 This can only happen if we allow him space to be with us on a Monday

230
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,200
 when we go to work.

231
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,640
 When we make room for God in our work and ask for him to be with us at work,

232
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,400
 he will absolutely do that and meet us there.

233
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,560
 And whenever God meets us, he molds us, he shapes us

234
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,480
 so that we look more and more like him.

235
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,920
 And when we do that, we flourish and then we can bring that flourishing about.

236
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,080
 Work then is a significant context for communion with God

237
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,360
 in that God is with us when we work

238
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,480
 and work is a vehicle for growing our relationship,

239
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,280
 growing in our intimacy with God, growing in our obedience and faith.

240
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,720
 What I mean by growing in obedience is that if we take Adam and Eve

241
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,320
 and their first test in the Garden of Eden as an example,

242
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,840
 they were tested with whether they will trust God,

243
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,760
 trust what God said to them.

244
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,480
 The serpent tested them and said, "Did God really say,

245
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,240
 'This is not good for you.'"

246
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,440
 You know, the challenges that you face at work are actually challenges

247
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,440
 for growth in your relationship with God.

248
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,080
 Because if you are tested at work, if you're at work and you're thinking,

249
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,000
 "Should I do this? Is this okay? Is this ethical?

250
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,800
 How should I respond to this difficult person?"

251
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,040
 Ask for God's help and God will absolutely show you the way.

252
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,920
 What that means is that we then have a choice.

253
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,720
 We then have to choose whether we will choose his way or our own way,

254
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,960
 whether we will choose obedience or rebellion.

255
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,240
 And God wants to guide you and empower you in your work.

256
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,760
 He also wants to show you how he has gifted you,

257
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,440
 what talents and gifts he's given you,

258
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,880
 and he wants to strengthen you in your weakness.

259
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,120
 In this sense, work can contribute to our sanctification.

260
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,000
 And when seen in this way, work actually becomes an essential component

261
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,920
 of our spiritual growth and formation.

262
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,040
 You may not have thought about work in this way before, but it is true.

263
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,840
 Work is spiritual formation.

264
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,400
 Work is a place where we get to learn to partner with God's will and purposes,

265
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,760
 where we get to work out our faith with fear and trembling.

266
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,080
 Cardinal Wyszynski, a Catholic bishop, said this,

267
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:01,480
 "Work is a sacrificial surrender to God at his bidding and direction.

268
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,320
 To accept work in all readiness, to guide it toward the heavenly Father,

269
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,800
 is to express oneself with one's whole soul,

270
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,840
 a soul that is full of trust and loving prayer."

271
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,280
 So just like we saw from Genesis 1,

272
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,720
 he says that the central purpose of work is to cooperate with God.

273
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,720
 Christians who work with this purpose in mind

274
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,080
 are expressing their love and trust in God,

275
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,680
 using all that God has given them as a means of worshipping him.

276
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,440
 Our workstation then becomes our worship station.

277
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,080
 And Eugene Peterson, the late American author

278
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,600
 who wrote the Message version of the Bibles, says this,

279
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,920
 "I'm prepared to contend that the primary location

280
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,520
 for spiritual formation is the workplace."

281
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,720
 So what does this mean for us now?

282
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,600
 This is an invitation from God to us.

283
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,840
 God is inviting us to offer our work with a heart full of trust and love

284
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,200
 and offer it back up to him as a sacrificial surrender.

285
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,160
 This is about an all-of-life discipleship.

286
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,280
 Our faith is meant to be lived out in all areas of our lives,

287
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,360
 outside of these walls, especially in our work.

288
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,200
 And we shouldn't be surprised if God takes us to places

289
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,960
 where there is hopelessness or even chaos,

290
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,320
 whether that means helping someone in our jobs,

291
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,840
 helping someone with their finances, in their education, in their job search,

292
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,360
 or if someone needs legal assistance.

293
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,120
 We can bring hope to these people through our work.

294
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,600
 When we each do that, we become that single drop.

295
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
 We usher in the kingdom of God.

296
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,920
 We are the ones who bring hope, bring love, bring this renewal,

297
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,840
 flourishing and transformation to our city.

298
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,320
 This is exciting and gives meaning and purpose to our lives.

299
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,200
 This is why we are launching the Work Life Ministry.

300
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,800
 So let me tell you about a few things that we have planned.

301
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,160
 We would love for you to join us in some of these things.

302
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,160
 First, you've already heard it mentioned earlier today

303
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,840
 that we are launching monthly online Lunch and Meet calls.

304
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,520
 It's starting next Wednesday, the 24th of March.

305
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,840
 The aim of these times is to explore together,

306
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,520
 how can we practically apply what God says,

307
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,720
 everything we've heard about today and more,

308
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,360
 how do we apply that in our lives?

309
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,840
 What does that really look like in real life?

310
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,920
 So once a month over a lunch break,

311
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,240
 we will hear work-related testimony,

312
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,080
 a little bit about what the Bible says about that topic,

313
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,200
 and then we'll have some time to talk about

314
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,720
 how we can do that in our lives.

315
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,360
 Next Wednesday, our launch of our Lunch and Meet,

316
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,960
 we have one of our congregation members, Alison Chan,

317
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,360
 who is the leader in the e-commerce and retail industry,

318
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,960
 sharing her journey of how she discovered God's purpose for her in her work

319
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,800
 and how she seeks to honor God in her work.

320
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,000
 So that is this coming Wednesday, join us.

321
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,880
 We also care hugely about those who want to work but are not employed.

322
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,920
 So we are hosting a one-off unemployment support group

323
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,080
 on Thursday, the 29th of April.

324
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,120
 If this is you, this is an opportunity for you to share

325
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,320
 any challenges or struggles you are facing,

326
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,720
 be it on a practical or emotional level.

327
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,800
 We know that it is a loss, and this will also give us an opportunity

328
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,280
 to listen, to come alongside you

329
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,920
 and hear how we can support you through this time.

330
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,560
 So these are the two things that are happening now.

331
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,320
 To tell you a few things that are happening later in the year,

332
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,880
 just very quickly, we are organizing a one-day joint church event

333
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,160
 on faith and work in October.

334
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,760
 We're also looking at running a short-term community group on work.

335
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,600
 So stay tuned for more details on these things.

336
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,240
 It's also on my heart to gather people from the same industry,

337
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,960
 say we can get together those people in finance,

338
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,480
 or in creative, in whatever industry, we can get together.

339
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,520
 And this time, we really want to hear from you what you think is best.

340
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,280
 This could be a chance where you meet other Christians in the same profession,

341
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,280
 or it could be a chance to talk about industry-specific things,

342
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,880
 and a chance to pray for you and anoint you.

343
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,520
 So I welcome your input.

344
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,000
 Please tell me what you think would be best and most beneficial

345
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,520
 for fellow Christians.

346
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,280
 I would also love to hear your stories.

347
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,760
 What's your experience as a Christian in your workplace?

348
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,160
 I'd love to hear from you too, especially if you are already engaged

349
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,760
 in some faith and work activity in your workplace.

350
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,400
 Is there anything we can do, that I can do to support you?

351
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,520
 The way to get in touch is on the toolkit.

352
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,960
 My contact details are on the toolkit.

353
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,840
 So let me tell you about the Connect Faith and Work toolkit

354
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,960
 that we are launching today.

355
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,360
 These are some immediate first steps that you can take.

356
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,400
 Under the action step, I point you towards a website.

357
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,640
 We've only covered a tiny bit about what the Bible says about work.

358
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,280
 So if that is something you would like to learn more about,

359
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,640
 this website, theologyofwork.org, would be a great place to start.

360
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,680
 We would also love for you to start building spiritual communities

361
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,800
 or spiritual friendships at work.

362
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,600
 Even if you don't meet at work physically,

363
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,440
 but you meet somewhere else, spiritual friendships

364
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,160
 with whom you can discuss your experiences at work

365
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,480
 is a great way to think through how you can follow Jesus in your workplace,

366
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,600
 especially if you're feeling isolated or lonely in your work,

367
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,200
 as Pastor Andrew prayed today.

368
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,400
 Do consider starting that.

369
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,640
 You can also dive into some daily devotions about work.

370
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,200
 There are some suggestions on the toolkit,

371
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,880
 some devotions on the YouVersionBible app or on bible.com.

372
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,440
 Then in the Going Deeper section,

373
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,960
 specifically for those who do want to host a group

374
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,000
 that explores the intersection between faith and work,

375
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,560
 be it at work or in a community group,

376
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:40,000
 there are five different resources that we have mentioned there.

377
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,840
 So that's what's in the toolkit.

378
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,240
 That's gone live.

379
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
 Check it out.

380
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,400
 Lastly, I'd love to share a little bit about my own journey with work.

381
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,000
 In my own work over the years, I've been in Christian ministry.

382
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,200
 I've worked in the business sector.

383
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,640
 I grew up in Hong Kong, so my roots are here in Hong Kong.

384
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,160
 I love Hong Kong.

385
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,080
 And then I went to the UK for high school, university,

386
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,360
 and started my working life in London.

387
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,760
 I was really settled and had no plans of moving back to Hong Kong.

388
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,360
 And then in 2016, as I was working on setting up my own business in London,

389
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,480
 I heard God say completely unexpectedly,

390
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,360
 "Lay down London life. I'm calling you back to Hong Kong."

391
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,960
 Not only did I feel called to lay down my work,

392
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,720
 a business that I thought God had directed me towards,

393
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,640
 but the call was to lay down my friends, my church, my community,

394
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,480
 my whole adult life that I had known.

395
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,240
 It was honestly one of the few things that God had asked me to do in my life

396
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,480
 that I didn't know how to say yes.

397
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,520
 It felt so big and so overwhelming

398
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,000
 that I didn't know if I had the strength to do it.

399
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,600
 I did manage to move back, and I moved back with no plans whatsoever.

400
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,080
 I didn't know why God asked me to move back,

401
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,480
 apart from helping to take care of my parents, who are in Hong Kong.

402
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,080
 It was terrifying.

403
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,920
 But fast forward to five years to today,

404
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,000
 I am honestly humbled and honoured that I am part of this amazing church,

405
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,960
 an amazing team, and never did I dream that I would have the opportunity

406
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,240
 to be launching our work-life ministry

407
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,920
 and to be talking to you about something I am so passionate about.

408
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,960
 What I'm really looking forward to is to wrestle

409
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,920
 through those work challenges together,

410
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,720
 to celebrate the victories together.

411
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,160
 And even though work can be challenging,

412
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,480
 I know God is with you in your work.

413
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,240
 God will be found in your work if you make room for Him.

414
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,160
 My heart is to come alongside you

415
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,960
 so that you can be that powerful single drop

416
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,280
 in your office, in your workstation, in your home, in your school.

417
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,640
 God has a purpose for you, and I can't wait

418
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,800
 to see how each of us will flourish

419
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,680
 and what God will do in our city when we work this way.

420
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,000
 That's the hope that God has for us

421
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,760
 and the hope that I have for all of us.

422
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,480
 This is audacious. It's exciting.

423
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,360
 So yes, even as I invite you to join in on this ministry,

424
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,920
 I really would like to pray for us that we would each in our hearts

425
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,960
 individually respond to this call of God

426
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,720
 to make room for Him, to surrender our whole lives,

427
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,040
 our whole work, and to partner with Him in our work.

428
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,000
 So let me pray.

429
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,040
 Father, we thank you for this tremendous call,

430
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,880
 this tremendous invitation that you would trust us

431
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,320
 to bring about your kingdom, to bring about your flourishing

432
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,360
 to the people around us, to our work, to our city.

433
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,080
 And God, I pray that we would respond now to you.

434
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,360
 We would respond with that heart full of love and trust.

435
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,720
 But I pray for those especially perhaps who do have a fear,

436
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,720
 who do worry that, "Can I really let go? Can I really trust God?"

437
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,480
 I pray, God, you will show them your goodness.

438
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,600
 We pray again for those who are feeling isolated.

439
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,120
 If that's in the work, we pray, God, that you will bring

440
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:39,960
 those communities, those special people to them.

441
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,920
 We pray for anyone, you know, if they do need to come to you

442
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:51,160
 and repent of making work something that you didn't mean it to be.

443
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,160
 And we pray for anyone who perhaps does feel really burnt out at work,

444
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,080
 does feel tired.

445
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,280
 God, may your spirit come, rest on them, and refresh them.

446
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,680
 And lastly, we pray a blessing on each of your work.

447
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,000
 We pray that God would anoint you as you go to work.

448
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,680
 And so now let's take some time to respond to God.

449
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:23,160
 Just really take some time to connect with God during this worship song.
