1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Thank you, Jason. Hey, let's give Jason a hand.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 First time service leading. Come on. That's good.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Yeah, you got some fans over there.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Well, when I was dating Chris, who's now my wife,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 so we went on several dates,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 there was a point where I was walking her to the bus stop.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And so we're walking to the bus stop, and I was like,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 "I'm going to seize this opportunity."

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 So I asked her, "Is it okay if I hold your hand?"

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And she, without any hesitation, said, "Yeah, no."

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 So I was like, "Oh, I guess I misread this situation here.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I thought we were on the same page, but apparently we're not."

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 And so she went on the bus, she drove off,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 and I had a depressing walk home.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 So I was wondering, you know, how does Chris feel about me?

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Like, does she like me?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Does she have the same feelings that I have?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And I was starting to question that. I was starting to worry.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 So luckily that night she called me and she told me,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 "Hey, there's some friends of mine. We want to get together."

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 It's like, "Oh, okay. We're getting together. Good. Good."

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 You know, there's further plans. It's not over. It's not the end.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 So then the way we defined the relationship, the DTR, right,

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 was when she told me, "You can hold my hand now."

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I was like, "Okay." So there we go.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And I did, by the way, I did ask for permission to share this story

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 so I don't just tell stories from our life unless I ask her.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So there you go.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 But all of this made me think about that there are times

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 where we wonder about how others feel about us.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 For me it was in this romantic relationship.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 For some it might be you wonder how our spouse feels about us.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 For others it might be we wonder how our children feel about us.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I was talking with a father this morning.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 We have both very little children.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We're like, "Do they realize, how do they feel?"

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Because sometimes they always seem to be turning their head away

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 when we come close.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 How do they feel about us?

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 So maybe as parents you wonder that.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Or maybe as a child you're wondering of your parents,

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 how your parents feel for you.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Maybe even as we are older we still wonder

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 how do our parents feel about us.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But then on our spiritual journeys we also ask that question.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 How does God feel about us?

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 How can I know how God feels about me, to be more specific?

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And so that's what we're going to explore through this message.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 We're continuing in our sermon series through the parables,

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Living in the Kingdom parables.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 We're in our second week.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 We're looking at how Jesus tells these stories that confront us,

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 challenge us, and that a lot of times open up a new way

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 for us to look at something or to understand something,

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 and where we can align ourselves with his kingdom values.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 We can adopt a kingdom mindset.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And so we're going to continue to do that today.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Now we are in the Gospel of Luke.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I'm going to just give a little bit of a brief summary

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 before we go into our passage just to set the context.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 So the context is basically Jesus is hanging out with everyone.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I mean he is spending time with every type of person.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 He's hanging out with religious people.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 He's hanging out with irreligious people.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 He is with the rich, with the poor.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 But it is the religious who are getting upset

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 about what Jesus is doing.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 It's rubbing them the wrong way.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And so that's the context where we're going to pick up.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 We're in Luke chapter 15 and starting in verse 1,

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 and it will be along on the screen so you can read along there.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 It says this, "Now the tax collectors and the sinners

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 were all gathering around to hear Jesus.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered,

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 'This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.'

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Then Jesus told them this parable,

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 'Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Doesn't he leave the 99 in the open country

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 and goes home.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says,

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 'Rejoice with me! I have found my lost sheep.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 in heaven over one sinner who repents

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 than over 99 righteous people who do not need to repent.'

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house,

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 search carefully until she finds it?

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 together and says, 'Rejoice with me! I have found my lost coin.'

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And in the same way I tell you there is rejoicing

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 in the presence of angels of God over one sinner who repents."

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Now before we go into these two parables,

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 there's actually a few verses before,

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 and I want to say a little bit about that.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 So in verse 1, we're told that the tax collectors,

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 the sinners, they're drawing near to Jesus.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 They're gathering around him because they want to hear from him.

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 There's just something attractive about Jesus.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 People just want to hear from him.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 They want to be around him.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 He has something to say.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 He speaks different than other people.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And so people are coming around him.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And interestingly enough, the Pharisees and the tax collectors

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 are also around him even though they have a problem with him.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And we're told that they muttered.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Now muttering or grumbling or complaining,

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 you can imagine it's like you're doing it in a way,

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 you're complaining about someone,

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 but you do it in a way that they can hear it.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 It's kind of a little bit under your breath,

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 but you make sure that the message is sent.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And so they're complaining that this man,

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 they don't even call him by his name, they call him this man,

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 welcomes sinners and eats with them.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Now what's the fuss all about?

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Why do the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 why are they so upset about what Jesus is doing?

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 There are several things that we need to understand that I want to unpack.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 So let me do that.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 The first thing is we have to understand who tax collectors were.

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Now tax collectors, so at this time in Israel,

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 the Romans were occupying Israel.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 So there's a foreign nation occupying Israel.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 They're collecting taxes, but they don't themselves collect taxes.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 They actually hire Israelites to do the tax collecting.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And I just found out that Israelites,

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 they could purchase the right to do that.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 So you could purchase the right to be the one who collects the taxes.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And what they did is not only that they collected taxes,

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 but they also took something on top of that.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 So not only are they in some sense colluding with the foreign force,

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 and a lot of people call them traitors, but they're also thieves.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 They're ripping people off.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 They're taking more money than they're entitled to.

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 So in some sense, it's not a surprise that the Pharisees

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 are not that excited that Jesus is hanging out with tax collectors.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So that's the first thing.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 There's a mention that they're sinners.

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Well, in some sense, that seems very self-explanatory, right?

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And it is a general category.

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 It could mean your occupation.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Maybe you're a sex worker.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 It could also mean that you simply do not measure up to the righteousness,

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 the standards that the Pharisees had set.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And by the way, they had like 600 and some laws.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 They went way beyond the biblical demands

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 and really placed a burden on a lot of people.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And if you're not able to keep up with that, you're part of the sinners.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 You're part of the irreligious people.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 But then there's a third factor that we have to understand,

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 and that is cultural, and that is table fellowship.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 So Jesus, he's not just spending time with them.

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 It actually indicates in the passage that he's inviting people.

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 He's hosting people.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 He's hosting tax collectors.

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 He's hosting sinners.

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And in that cultural context, if you're inviting somebody to eat with you,

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 it means there's friendship, there's association, there's acceptance.

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 And that is what really rubs the Pharisees

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 and the teachers of the law the wrong way.

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 But of course, this is part of Jesus' gospel message,

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 his good news message.

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And actually through spending time with broken, with hurting,

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 with sinful people, he's actually living out his message.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Jesus actually reflects his message that forgiveness and life in the kingdom

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 are available through him.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 However, the religious leaders, they have a different perspective on that.

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 They're like, "We don't want none of that.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 You're spending time with people who show disregard for God,

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 and you feel good about hanging out with them.

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 So by doing that, you really undermine the social structures

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 and what's called good and what's called bad."

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 And so they're very upset.

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Now, the problem, of course, is that they can't see that Jesus is God in flesh,

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 that he is God's son, and that he is showing God's heart

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 for broken, for sinful, for hurting people.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 By associating them, by spending time with them,

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 by welcoming them into his kingdom,

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 by looking to restore them back to the Father.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And so in response to this, Jesus tells a parable

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 because he wants to reveal God's heart.

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 I'm going to do heart.

186
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 He wants to reveal God's heart, the Father's heart.

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 He wants to give a window into that

188
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 so that the Pharisees and everyone can see God's heart for people.

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 So let's look at the parables.

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 So there's a parable about sheep, one that's lost,

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 and a parable about coins, where one coin is lost.

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Now, both of those things were valuable,

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 but there's an increase in value.

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 One out of 100 sheep, and then one out of 10 silver coins,

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 and then actually there's another parable that comes afterwards.

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 It's one lost son, or probably two lost sons, really.

197
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And God, Jesus, he invites us by putting ourselves in the shoes of the shepherd,

198
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 by putting ourselves in the shoes of the woman who lost something so valuable to her

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 that we can get in touch with God's heart for those who are lost.

200
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Then we can start feeling what God feels.

201
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 So basically, he's inviting us to put us into God's shoes

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 so we can experience some of God's feelings as we imagine that.

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 So both parables, they start off with this imaginary thing that we're supposed to imagine.

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 So in verse 4, it says, "Suppose one of you has 100 sheep and loses one of them.

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Doesn't he leave the 99 in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?"

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 So, you know, suppose, imagine.

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And then the other one, verse 8, "Or suppose a woman has 10 silver coins and loses one."

208
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Again, we're asked to imagine.

209
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And so Jesus is expecting an affirmative answer.

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Of course the woman's going to go look for the coin.

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Of course I'm going to look for the lost sheep.

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 For us, it's maybe like if we lose our diamond engagement ring.

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Of course you're going to go look and search for it.

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 You're not just going to let that lay. It's not a big deal.

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I'm just going to not worry.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 But, you know, you're going to look for it because it's valuable to you.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Because it's something that you treasure.

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Or maybe an iPhone for other people.

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Your new iPhone. You bought it and you lose it.

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 You're going to look for it. You want to find it.

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And so Jesus is saying, "If you go search for lost items, lost things, in the way that you do,

223
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 how much more does God search for lost people?

224
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 How much more valuable are they to him?"

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 So the first insight that we gain with God's heart is that God actively searches for us

226
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 because every person is precious to him.

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Every single person is precious to him.

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 So he treasures you.

229
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 He does not casually look for you a little bit and then says, "Oh, whatever."

230
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 No, he searches for you eagerly, ferociously to find you.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 As we continue to go through the parable, there's another theme that emerges.

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 And it's the theme of rejoicing.

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 There's just such great joy in finding what's lost.

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 I mean, if you found your lost engagement ring or wedding ring, you're full of joy.

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 You're excited. You text. You call.

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Maybe you throw a party.

237
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 It's a big deal.

238
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And so here we also read in verse 5, "And when he finds it," talking about the sheep,

239
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 "he joyfully puts it on his shoulders."

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 That really stuck out to me, that the shepherd, he finds the sheep.

241
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 You know, we don't know how far off this sheep is.

242
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I don't know if you've ever been around sheep.

243
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 They're actually quite heavy.

244
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Joyfully putting it on your shoulder, smelly, stinky sheep.

245
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 You know?

246
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 But he does it joyfully.

247
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 He joyfully restores the sheep back to the sheepfold.

248
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 And then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, "Rejoice with me.

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 I have found my lost sheep."

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And then there's this comparison to heaven, right, where I tell you that in the same way

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 there will be more rejoicing.

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 So it's even a greater joy when lost people are found, when they repent of their sins,

253
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 when they receive the forgiveness of Jesus.

254
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And then the same with the coin.

255
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 You know, she rejoices.

256
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 She asks others to rejoice with her as she finds it.

257
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And then there is rejoicing, the presence of angels of God over one sinner who repents.

258
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 So Jesus in both parables, he highlights again there's the earthly scene and then there's

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 a heavenly scene and there's a comparison like you who rejoice over these lost things

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 that you find, how much more does God rejoice over lost people?

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And I think theoretically we affirm that.

262
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 I think there's a lot of theoretical things in our faith.

263
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 But if we're honest, I'm not sure if our life actually always really shows that, that we

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 really rejoice over lost people being found, that we really care about people who are wandering,

265
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 who are hurting.

266
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And then maybe a lot of times we're more like the Pharisees and the teachers of the law

267
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 where we're frustrated with people and we, "Did you hear about those people?"

268
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And we say things like that.

269
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 But Jesus, he rejoices.

270
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And through his parable he's saying, "Do you want to know what it feels like to be God?

271
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Do you want to know how God feels about people?

272
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Do you want to know how God feels about you?

273
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Or when one person turns to me, it feels like I just found my most valuable possession."

274
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Wow.

275
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 It's amazing.

276
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 So the second insight in the God's heart that we gain is that God loves and pursues all

277
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 people and that he rejoices over every person that is found, over every single person.

278
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 But why does Jesus tell us this parable?

279
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And why does he feel the need to reveal God's heart in these circumstances?

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Well, initially we saw that he's talking to the Pharisees and the tax collectors, and

281
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 he is challenging them to get in touch with God's heart because their heart is not aligned

282
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 with God.

283
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 They think their heart is aligned, but it's not.

284
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And so there's a challenge to adopt a different perspective, to adopt the heart of God for

285
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 the people around them, to understand what Jesus is doing.

286
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And because they're opposing the very thing that God is doing through Jesus.

287
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 They're opposing the very thing.

288
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And they're not in touch with God's heart for the lost.

289
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And they can't imagine wanting to have anything to do with broken, with hurting, with lost

290
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 people.

291
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 They just want to hang out with their crew, their righteous crew.

292
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And I think that's another thing for us in the church.

293
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 A lot of times we're just happy to go to our fellowships.

294
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 We're happy to be around people that are wonderful and great.

295
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But actually, if push comes to shove, and that's why earlier I said that a lot of times

296
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 parts of our faith are theoretical, actually we don't really want to cross those barriers

297
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 that Jesus crosses and spend time with people who just have messy lives, who are not liked

298
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 by society, where we might even get in trouble for associating with them.

299
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 But what I love about Jesus is he doesn't just scold the Pharisees.

300
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 It's actually an invitation for them.

301
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And so he's inviting us as well.

302
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 You know, to have that same heart that God has for the lost.

303
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And actually one thing we can do is we can ask the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with

304
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 love for the lost.

305
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Because nothing that I say here will change your heart, but it's God's work in your heart.

306
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 It's the Spirit of God's work in your heart that changes your heart.

307
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And so if you're feeling it, I want to encourage you to just say some prayer.

308
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Holy Spirit, will you come into my heart and will you give me a heart for those who are lost?

309
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Will you change my heart?

310
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Because I can't do it on my own strength.

311
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Now what's interesting is that the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, actually their

312
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 attitude and their contempt, it shows that there are actually also people who are far

313
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 away from God.

314
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 They also need rescuing.

315
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 They also need to be restored back to the Father.

316
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 They also need compassion from those who know God.

317
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 So even the religious, you know, the self-righteous, God also cares about them and longs for them

318
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 to be restored.

319
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 But one thing that I haven't highlighted in the parable is in verse 3, yes, you know,

320
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 the parable is addressed to the Pharisees and the tax collectors, but actually it is

321
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 also, remember who Jesus is talking to or who's listening to him, it's the tax collectors

322
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 and the sinners.

323
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 So he's also giving a window into God's heart for the tax collectors and the sinners.

324
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Because they need to also know how God feels about them.

325
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Because the message they've been getting is, "You do not measure up.

326
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 You don't belong.

327
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 You are awful.

328
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 You have no place here."

329
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 That's the message that they've been sent.

330
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 That's the kind of vibe that the Pharisees sent to the people.

331
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 And so they need to also know God's heart.

332
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Because usually we know that our lives are messed up.

333
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 We don't need somebody else to usually tell us that.

334
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 You know, we know the things that we've done that are wrong.

335
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 But if the message is that there's no hope for us, then why bother?

336
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 You know, but Jesus is saying there's hope.

337
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And I want you to know God's heart for you.

338
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 So in strong contrast, Jesus reveals God's heart through these stories

339
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 to those who are rejected, broken, those who are carrying shame and hurt and self-hatred.

340
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And he's saying, "You're just the kind of person that I want to spend time with

341
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 and that I would want to restore back to the Father."

342
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Jesus himself said about himself, "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."

343
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 That's why he came.

344
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 This is why he's come, to reveal once and for all God's love for all people.

345
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Through his life, through his ministry, through his teachings, through his parables,

346
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 through his death, through his resurrection.

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And it's ultimately, you know, on the cross that this question that I earlier raised,

348
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 "How can I know how God feels about me?"

349
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 That that question is answered.

350
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Because it shows how God feels about you.

351
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 He loves you so much.

352
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 It doesn't matter what you have done.

353
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 That he came to this earth, humbled himself, laid down his life for yours and took your place.

354
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Observed the punishment, the judgment that you deserved.

355
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 So that you can be forgiven, that you can be set free,

356
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 that you can receive a new life in Jesus.

357
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 So Jesus doesn't just say, "Oh, I love you," or "I tell great parables."

358
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 He puts his words in the actions.

359
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And he dies for you.

360
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Now as I was preparing this message,

361
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 you know, the one thing that stuck out to me in both parables was

362
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 how in both parables it's the one that the shepherd and that the woman goes after.

363
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 The one lost sheep and the one coin.

364
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And the same is true for us.

365
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 God doesn't come after us in a general way.

366
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 And, you know, let me go over, you know, seven billion people in a general way.

367
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 He always goes after the one that is lost.

368
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 It's personal.

369
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And nothing else would bring him greater joy

370
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 than finding that one lost person and restoring that person back to the Father.

371
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 He wants you to come back home.

372
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 He wants you to know that you are not too far away from him.

373
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 It's not too late.

374
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 God seeks after you even if you've messed it up.

375
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 This is also true for Christians as well because even as Christians on our journey,

376
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 sometimes we just mess it up majorly.

377
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And we feel like we don't deserve to come back to God.

378
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 He doesn't love us.

379
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 There is no second chance for us.

380
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 But there is.

381
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 It doesn't matter what bad choices you made.

382
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 It doesn't matter what you have done.

383
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 He wants to restore you back to the Father because he loves you.

384
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 And he loves you so deeply and so dearly.

385
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And his heart breaks for you, for the one, until you are restored back to him.

386
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Now some of us here, we feel like we are not valuable enough to be sought after.

387
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 There's been also messages in your life that have been sent to you

388
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 that you don't belong, that you shouldn't even come here, there's no hope for you.

389
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And this reminded me of a story where I was in the Department of Motor Vehicles in California, DMV.

390
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I was standing in line and there was a person who was experiencing homelessness.

391
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And he asked me to help him fill out--I was renewing my driver's license

392
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 and he needed a government ID and he asked me if I could help fill him out the form.

393
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Because life on the streets, drugs and alcohol and sleeping under weather conditions and everything,

394
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 he didn't have the motor skills anymore to fill out forms.

395
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And so I was filling out the form for him and then got to the point where there was a question

396
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 where he asked, "Do you want to donate your organs?"

397
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 And so I asked him, "Would you like to be an organ donor?"

398
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 He said, "Me? I am junk. Who would want my organs?"

399
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Now he was a man that had been getting the message that he was junk,

400
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 that he was not worthy, that he did not belong,

401
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 that his life was too messed up to be of any value.

402
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 And at some point in time he just believed it because that's the message that was being sent to him.

403
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 But that's not how Jesus feels about him.

404
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 For Jesus, he is a lost treasure that needs to be restored to him.

405
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 He's not junk. He's made in the image of God.

406
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And he longs to bring him back to the Father.

407
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 And when he does, there is rejoicing and there's a party and there's a celebration like you have not seen before.

408
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Because the one who is lost is found and is restored.

409
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And so you, excuse me,

410
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 you are God's treasure that he loves and that he is seeking to restore.

411
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Now I want to invite the worship team to come up.

412
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 You are God's treasure that he loves and that he is seeking to restore.

413
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Now as I was praying for the day, I had a word.

414
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 And the word was that there's a man here that feels like he has messed it up too much to be restored to God,

415
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 to receive his forgiveness, to be made, brought home, to be made whole.

416
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 But as we heard today, you know, you are not too far away.

417
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And this is true for everyone, you know, for this man, but also for everyone else.

418
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 You know, God loves you and he wants to restore you back to him.

419
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Now, even if you would be the only single person in this world,

420
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Jesus would still die for you on the cross.

421
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 He would still lay down his life for you and he would still go after you because you are worth it.

422
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Because he loves you that much and he wants you to know that.

423
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 And he wants you to be found and he wants you to be part of the family of God.

424
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 He wants you to know God and experience the life that he gives.

425
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And so what I want to do right now is I want to actually just create an opportunity for you to open your heart

426
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 and to be found and to welcome in Jesus into your heart.

427
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Now, you can imagine this picture of, you know, your heart having a door

428
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 and there's only a door handle on the inside.

429
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 You know, Jesus doesn't force himself into the door, but he's knocking.

430
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 And it's only you who can welcome him in.

431
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And he said, "Come into my life.

432
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Forgive me and give me that new life in you."

433
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And so I'm going to--the way we do that is by praying a simple prayer.

434
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 It's like saying that we're sorry, we say thank you, and we say please.

435
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 So I want to invite those of you who want to pray this prayer, you can pray this,

436
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 you can quietly make this your own.

437
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 And so let me pray this prayer for us.

438
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Jesus, thank you so much that you love me so much.

439
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 I'm sorry for all the things that I've done wrong.

440
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 And actually, right now, you can tell Jesus the things that you've done wrong

441
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 and ask him for forgiveness.

442
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 So I'll give a little time for that.

443
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me on the cross

444
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 so that I can be forgiven and that I can be set free.

445
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 I receive your forgiveness now.

446
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 And I place my trust in you.

447
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Will you come by your Holy Spirit into my heart,

448
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 and will you be with me forever?

449
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Thank you, Jesus. Amen.

450
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 I want to invite everyone to stand.

451
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Now, if you've prayed this prayer,

452
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 now you, there's rejoicing in heaven.

453
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 There's a party going on,

454
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 because the one who was lost has been found,

455
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 and is restored to the Father.

456
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 And I just want to encourage you if you pray this prayer,

457
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 just let somebody know.

458
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Let them celebrate with you.

459
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Maybe somebody brought you, maybe somebody from the staff.

460
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 We would be so excited for you.

461
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 And we also would love to help you, you know, take those next steps with Jesus.

462
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 But I also would love to pray for us,

463
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 because I feel like even though theoretically we know that Jesus loves us,

464
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 we don't always feel it.

465
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And we also wonder, does God really love me?

466
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 So perhaps if you're feeling that,

467
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 I want to invite you just to stretch out your hands before you.

468
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 If you're just wondering, or you just want a deeper sense of God's love,

469
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 just as an expression of openness to God, you can stretch out your hands.

470
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 And I would just love to pray over you.

471
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Jesus, I thank you that you love every single person here,

472
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 and that your love is so deep and so strong for every single one of us.

473
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Lord, you know everyone's story here right now.

474
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 You know, for those of us who just wonder about that, maybe we doubt your love.

475
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 But I pray that by your Holy Spirit, you will come into our hearts.

476
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 You will flood our hearts with your love.

477
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 You will make your heart, your love known to us.

478
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 How great your love is for us.

479
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 How you have not forgotten us.

480
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 How you are there for us.

481
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 How you are with us every single moment of the day.

482
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 So will you reveal this to us, Lord?

483
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Because we're struggling sometimes to see it.

484
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Will you pour out your love into our hearts right now by your Holy Spirit?

485
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 As your word says in Romans 5, 5, you know that you pour your love into us.

486
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Will you make your love known to us in tangible ways that we have not known before?

487
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 And will you strengthen your people?

488
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 So I pray all that in your name, Jesus.

489
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Amen.

490
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Let's worship.

491
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:11,000
