[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460]   The reason why Good Friday is called good is because Abel's blood is not the only blood
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.740]   that tells the story.
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.040]   The writer of Hebrews says, doesn't he, that the sprinkled blood of Jesus tells a better
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.320]   word than the blood of Abel.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.720]   For the writer, I think he understood that in the sprinkled blood of Jesus on the cross,
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.280]   a new time of history has begun, which is why the New Testament speaks of Good Friday
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.320]   as the turning point of all history.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.720]   One way to think about it might be that all of the word that Abel's blood has spoken through
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.760]   thousands of years of history, the words that hurt us and have framed and so deeply shaped
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.640]   us, all of those words funnel into the cross.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.480]   And through the death of Christ on the cross, a new word flows out of him, a word that changes
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.040]   everything, a word that invites us into a new story and a new season, a word that begins
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:09.120]   to say something that is the opposite of what had been said before, a word that turns everything
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.920]   on the axis of its power.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.080]   This is the new hope that is now seen with this blood that Jesus sheds.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.480]   What has always been so profound to me is that the words that Jesus speaks with his
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.760]   mouth on the cross foretell the word that his blood would speak from his body.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.400]   He says on the cross, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.760]   Beginning a new story of forgiveness where jealousy and rage had been the story before.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.200]   He then turns to the criminal who's being crucified next to him and he says this, he
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.480]   says, "Today you will be with me in paradise."
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.400]   And I love that idea because what Jesus is saying is this, no matter how strongly the
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.240]   previous word of Abel has shaped you, no matter how hard life might have been, no matter how
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.760]   difficult things have been because of the words that have been spoken and said of you
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.160]   with just one word from Jesus, everything can change.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.960]   Immediately he says to the criminal, "You will be with me in paradise."
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.240]   And then Jesus speaks the most important three words in all of history, "It is finished."
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.080]   In other words, the story that Abel's blood began is done.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.040]   It is finished.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.240]   It's paid for.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.400]   It is replaced now with a new story and with new words and with new hope that even though
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.580]   sometimes the Abel voice seems so loud in us because of what's happened on the cross
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.320]   now, everything has been turned upside down and a new voice can be heard in the world.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.200]   A new voice can be proclaimed from the brokenness that was seen on the cross.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.120]   A new voice now spoken by sprinkled blood.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.840]   I love what God is doing on the cross.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.640]   Think of it this way.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.840]   God in his saving compassion for all that he has made, takes what was a symbol that
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.280]   was designed to communicate nothing other than the human power of death and he turns
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:33.120]   it into a symbol that now communicates nothing other than the divine power of life.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.920]   That's Good Friday.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.760]   That's the cross.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.500]   That's the beauty and the wonder of what Christ has done.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.160]   And so while on this night we should come with the words that Abel has spoken and we
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.320]   should recognize the sin that so easily entangles in us and recognize and write them down and
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.160]   stick them there and proclaim that we know that that blood still speaks to us.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.880]   Yes, we do that.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.340]   But here's what Good Friday really is.
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.480]   Good Friday is a celebration.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.800]   Good Friday is a place of joy.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.080]   And of course when we get to the tomb on Sunday and we see its emptiness, we have a new profound
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.120]   understanding of what resurrection is.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.280]   So we don't have to wait for Sunday to understand that a power has happened, that a story has
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.980]   been changed, that a new story has begun.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.560]   Good Friday is good because it already proclaims something good.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.700]   It already births new life for us all.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.920]   It already welcomes us into a better story than the story we had been walking in before.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.120]   That is Friday.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.240]   And so as we recognize this, we begin to reflect on how Jesus' blood tells a dramatically
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.400]   different story.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   Think on a few of these with me for a moment.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:59.840]   Where Abel's blood was shed in privates and from the ground it cried out for God for justice,
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.680]   Jesus' blood was shed in public and cried out from the cross in justice.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:16.640]   Where Abel's blood was shed out of a place of vengeance and created hostility, Jesus'
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.200]   blood was shed from a place of forgiveness and invoked grace.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.760]   Where Abel's blood brought a curse on its offender, Jesus' blood brings a blessing to
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.520]   all offenders.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:41.780]   Where Abel's blood drove Cain from the presence of God, Jesus' blood reaches out to every
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:49.960]   prodigal son and daughter and says, "You are welcomed home, embraced in a new home where
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.680]   we share in the banquet of reconciliation with the Father."
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.840]   Where the blood of Abel spoke a story that was shaped by jealousy, arrogance, and pride,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:09.680]   the blood of Jesus speaks a story that is shaped by welcome, humility, and grace.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.960]   This is the story we're wrapped up in.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.680]   I love the way that theologian Brian Zahn puts it.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.020]   He says this, "When grace was pierced, it bled pardon."
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.000]   And that forgiveness that sits in the wonder of the sprinkled blood of Jesus is the beginning
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.660]   point of the new story for you and I.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.280]   When the apostle Paul was trying to bring words to understanding the power of the turning
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.120]   point of the cross, he wrote it like this in Ephesians 2 verse 13, "But now in Christ
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.600]   Jesus, you who were once far away have been brought near through the blood of Jesus."
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.860]   This is the new story, my friends, that we hold onto on Good Friday.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:57.100]   No longer separated by the old story, but now drawn near in the new.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.320]   No longer striving to create something of significance and being exhausted, but now
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.160]   found in the hands of God in all fruitfulness.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:15.680]   No longer restless wanderers, but sons and daughters, children of the living God.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.680]   That is a better story.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.560]   That's the story we celebrate today.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.840]   And that story should light something up inside of you that makes you proud of the fact that
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.480]   you have a Savior who is willing to do that on the cross.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:35.480]   One who offers to you a new beginning, new hope, where the words that we've written on
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:42.520]   the cross today, words that spoke of the story that Abel has given us are no longer the words
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.160]   that should shape us from this moment forward.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:52.240]   And we want to help you to celebrate the new story that has been purchased by the sprinkled
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.280]   blood of Jesus for you.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.520]   So like we did before, I'm going to hand now back to Justin and back to Ellison, and they're
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:04.320]   going to lead you in liturgy and prayer and another activity that enables the sprinkled
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:11.480]   blood of Jesus to tell to you tonight a better story.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.480]   You pray again once more.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.540]   Where the shedding of Abel's blood called for vengeance and invoked a curse, the shedding
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:29.520]   of Jesus' blood calls for forgiveness and invokes a blessing.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.320]   Where in the shedding of Abel's blood there is jealousy, arrogance, and pride, in the
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:41.120]   shedding of Jesus' blood there is humility and grace.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.680]   Where the shedding of Abel's blood has driven us away from the land and left us wandering
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.000]   about in fruitless labor, the shedding of Jesus' blood brings us peace in the hands
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.120]   of God, calls the prodigal home, reaffirming their place eternally in the presence of God.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.720]   Where the shedding of Abel's blood separates us from God, speaking death over humanity,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:11.080]   the shedding of Jesus' blood ends the reign of sin and death over humanity and speaks
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:20.600]   a better word of love, forgiveness, and life.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.400]   - As a church, we get to do something really special now, and this is a really beautiful
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.720]   way we can pray for and encourage each other.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:34.580]   So just as we wrote down words of, you know, that come from the blood of Abel all over
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:41.160]   these crosses we see around us, but now we get a chance to speak the blood of Jesus over
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.540]   ourselves.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.640]   And so what I want us to do in this next section is, you know, take these words that have been
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:53.120]   written, and as you come forward, you'll see a red pen that is on the, at the foot of the
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120]   cross as well.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.240]   So choose one, don't choose your own, but try and find one that, you know, interests
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   you.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:07.000]   Read it, pray about it, and then ask God to give you a better word to speak over what
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.280]   you've written and read on these post-it notes.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.960]   And once you receive that word, I want us to cross out the word that was written, and
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.440]   we write the new word on it, the word of life, the word of hope, the word that God has given
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:25.320]   to you to speak and to pour out as His blood did over each other.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.040]   So does that make sense, what I'm saying?
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.480]   Okay, so again, all over the, try and find one that's not your own.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.520]   Take it, pray for that person, pray over that word, cross out the old word, and write a
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.800]   new word, word of life, word of hope, word that comes from the Lord.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.160]   And in this way, we can encourage and pray for each other as a church.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.400]   So again, take some time to do that.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.720]   After you do that, you'll also notice that there's some communion cups that are available
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.080]   at the foot of the cross as well.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.360]   So we want to make communion available for everyone here tonight as well.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.960]   In the cup, of course, is the bread, which represents the body of Christ, and the blood,
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.960]   the wine that represents the blood of Jesus.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.040]   And we do this in commemoration of what Jesus did for us as well.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.680]   So you can take communion in your own time.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.720]   If you've come with friends and family, you can take communion together in that way as
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   well.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.560]   So grab your communion, go back to your seat, and take communion in your own time.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.280]   And at the same time, if you want to come forward, take one of these words, cross out
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:34.040]   the old word, and write a new word of life and hope over each other tonight.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.600]   So yeah, come on, church.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.680]   Let's pray for each other in this way.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.280]   [MUSIC]
