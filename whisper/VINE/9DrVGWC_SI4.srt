1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:05,760
 Everyone says, amen, amen.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,040
 Have a seat.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,160
 I'm so excited to be with you this morning.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,080
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,320
 So if this is relatively one of your first times at The Vine,

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,200
 we're so glad that you're here.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,560
 I'm really blessed.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,560
 Sandra's in the house here today.

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,040
 Sandra and John founded The Vine,

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,160
 led The Vine for many years.

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,800
 Thanks for being with us, Sandra.

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,640
 We love you.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,680
 Justine is back.

15
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,160
 So nice to see Justine as well.

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,920
 And I know that there are so many other people

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,960
 that are visiting with us.

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,560
 Joe, my mate from the UK, sounds so British, doesn't he?

19
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,120
 You love him.

20
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,920
 Yeah, mate, yeah.

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,480
 But we know also you may be new as well.

22
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,000
 So grateful to have you with us.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,920
 We're in part two of a three-part series on justice,

24
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,560
 and in particular, on God's heart for justice.

25
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,000
 And what we've been saying over these weeks

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,440
 is that what we're teaching in you last week,

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,960
 this week, next week, are foundational messages

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
 for who we are as The Vine.

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,200
 We feel here at The Vine that we've been called

30
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,280
 as a church to put justice in God's heart,

31
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,960
 to justice and for justice,

32
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,960
 at the center of what we do as a community.

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,040
 And so if this is your home already,

34
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,600
 or if this is going to become your home,

35
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,920
 then you're gonna hear us talk a lot

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,000
 about the realities of the poor and the broken

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,320
 and the vulnerable in our society,

38
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,640
 in our city, in the situation that we're here with.

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,200
 And we're gonna challenge one another

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,880
 to be the church to the city that is around us.

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,120
 And so last week, as we started this series,

42
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,160
 I started by giving you a theology of justice.

43
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,000
 I wanted us to really understand

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,440
 how justice sits at the heart

45
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,560
 of the biblical redemptive narrative

46
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
 that we have in Scripture.

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,640
 And so we literally went from Genesis to Revelation,

48
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,280
 unpacking the idea that the gospel,

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,560
 and this is really important, church,

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,680
 that the gospel is not just the restoration

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,920
 of my relationship with God, as important as that is.

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
 That's certainly a central part of the gospel.

53
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,120
 What we see in Scripture,

54
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,760
 that the gospel is the restoration

55
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,560
 of not just a broken relationship here,

56
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,360
 but also a broken relationship here.

57
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,160
 That if the gospel truly brings shalom,

58
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,440
 then the gospel has to rectify

59
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,520
 the four broken relational contexts

60
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,320
 that we see happen in Genesis 1, 2, and 3.

61
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,920
 And we looked last week, didn't we,

62
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,960
 that in Genesis 1 and 2, God creates humanity

63
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,400
 as the pinnacle of his heart,

64
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,800
 labels humanity as the image of God,

65
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,280
 and then defines for humanity what is right and wrong.

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
 We said last week that God is the one

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,480
 who defines for us what is right and wrong.

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,040
 And then God creates four relational contexts

69
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,720
 by which we express the right and wrong of the Father.

70
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,200
 That's our relationship with God,

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,680
 our relationship with ourselves,

72
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
 our relationship with others,

73
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,040
 and our relationship with creation.

74
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,920
 So in Genesis 1 and 2,

75
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,560
 we see these beautiful relational contexts created.

76
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,080
 And at the end of Genesis 2, God stands back from that,

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,640
 and he says those words, doesn't he?

78
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,320
 He says, "This is shalom.

79
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,160
 This is the way things were meant to be.

80
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,280
 The world is now designed and is flourishing

81
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,240
 in the way in which it was created to be."

82
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,000
 And then of course, we saw Genesis 3,

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,640
 the intaking of sin, Satan's tricking of humanity

84
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,520
 to think that they shouldn't just be image of God,

85
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,480
 but they can be gods themselves.

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,240
 And in taking that fruit, what we see straight away

87
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,520
 is that humanity now begins to define

88
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,200
 what is right and wrong.

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
 Where in Genesis 1 and 2,

90
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,280
 God defines what is right and wrong,

91
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,120
 in Genesis 3, humanity begins to take on the ability

92
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,680
 or thinks that it has the ability

93
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,760
 to define what is right and wrong.

94
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,600
 And we said last week that when humanity defines

95
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
 what is right and wrong rather than the divine,

96
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,160
 we will always define it in a way that benefits ourselves.

97
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,200
 Like myself, not you.

98
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,800
 Like I will define it in a way

99
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,080
 where I will have an advantage over others

100
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,800
 and where there'll be self-preservation.

101
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
 So last week we saw Adam throwing his wife

102
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,320
 immediately under the bus.

103
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,360
 When God shows up,

104
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,240
 that brokenness of relationship begins to happen,

105
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,000
 and we begin to create right and wrong

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,640
 in the way that we want it for the benefit of ourselves.

107
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,200
 And injustice is born.

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,040
 And then we saw, of course,

109
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,640
 that God begins to restore this

110
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,640
 through the calling of a nation, Israel through Abraham.

111
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,880
 We saw that importance of justice and righteousness,

112
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,880
 the reality that those things work together

113
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,080
 within that nation, and yet also the idea of wickedness.

114
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,120
 And we said last week, didn't we,

115
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,560
 that the wickedness or the way of injustice is wicked.

116
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,440
 And the wicked in the Old Testament,

117
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,680
 basically are willing to disadvantage the community

118
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,840
 for the advantage of themselves.

119
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,360
 Whereas the justice and righteous

120
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,520
 are willing to disadvantage themselves

121
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,480
 for the advantage of the community.

122
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,720
 And so you get this beautiful picture

123
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,920
 in the Old Testament of what scripture calls us to

124
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,400
 in this idea of justice,

125
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,920
 but it's just beginning to be modelled for them.

126
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,040
 And then we see the Exodus,

127
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,760
 and in the Exodus is that model that begins to happen.

128
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,240
 God takes his oppressed people in compassion.

129
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,880
 He advocates on their behalf.

130
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,200
 Then he acts to bring them out of their slavery,

131
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,240
 and he provides for them that great place

132
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,760
 of future flourishing in the promised land.

133
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,000
 And so we see the Exodus story as God's model.

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,920
 He's beginning to show his people

135
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,040
 what this justice journey can look like.

136
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,600
 But again, we saw in the Old Testament

137
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,440
 that there is this cycle of injustice,

138
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,320
 that even though God is beginning to model it,

139
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,440
 even though God is beginning to redefine

140
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,000
 the right and wrong for his people,

141
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,040
 the people are so steeped in sin,

142
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,280
 it so easily has entangled them,

143
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,240
 that they realise by the end of the Old Testament

144
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,320
 that they can't do it.

145
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,920
 They can't fix that relationship with God.

146
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,960
 They can't fix the relationship with themselves.

147
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,640
 They can't fix the relationship with others,

148
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,640
 and they certainly can't fix the relationship

149
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,800
 with the broken world around us.

150
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,040
 And so there's this crying out

151
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,000
 at the end of the Old Testament, right?

152
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 There's this desire for God to step in

153
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,720
 and do what only God can do,

154
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,640
 'cause humanity cannot do it.

155
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,840
 And then Jesus, this beautiful incarnation,

156
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,920
 fully God and fully human,

157
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,760
 the spoke that is driven in that wheel of injustice

158
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,000
 to borrow Dietrich Bonhoeffer's beautiful picture.

159
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,880
 And Jesus, because he's fully God and fully human,

160
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,760
 he is the spoke 'cause he's fully God,

161
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,240
 but then he's able to deal with sin 'cause he's fully human.

162
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,600
 And being those two things together,

163
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,400
 he begins to model for us a new way.

164
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,080
 Again, advocacy, again, work in action with his miracles

165
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,920
 and the way that he serves and he teaches.

166
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,400
 And then that moment on the cross,

167
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,280
 the moment on the cross where he gives his life

168
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,480
 so that we might know the fullness of life,

169
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,440
 where he pays that price for the redemption of our sin,

170
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,600
 the blood poured out, the sacrifice once and for all,

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,000
 so that sin no longer has the final say.

172
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
 And then in his resurrection,

173
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,000
 the creating of a new community, the church,

174
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,240
 a community that he fills with his spirit

175
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,840
 and sends out into the world to now be his hands and feet,

176
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,320
 to disciple the nations,

177
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,680
 to bring them into a new way of thinking.

178
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,040
 And all of the New Testament centers this

179
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,320
 on this idea of the gospel,

180
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,600
 that the gospel is not just about the restoration

181
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,880
 of my relationship with God alone, as central as that is,

182
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,200
 but as that relationship is also then healed and restored.

183
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,480
 Then I have a restored relationship with myself.

184
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,920
 I no longer consider myself a slave,

185
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,440
 but I am a child of God.

186
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,320
 I then have a restored relationship with those around me.

187
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,000
 I've been brought into a family together

188
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,160
 and now there is peace amongst us as a community.

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,320
 And then because creation has been groaning,

190
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,760
 but now it will no longer groan

191
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,680
 because Christ on the cross has paid the price

192
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,360
 and creation itself longing for its own redemption.

193
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
 And the gospel, if it is the gospel,

194
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,480
 if it is a gospel that brings shalom,

195
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,720
 if it's a gospel that deals with the brokenness of sin,

196
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,480
 can't just fix this.

197
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,440
 It has to also fix this, fix this and fix that.

198
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,400
 That's the whole gospel.

199
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,920
 That was all last week in about five seconds for you.

200
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,360
 Okay, so if that was helpful for you,

201
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,200
 or if you're like,

202
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,680
 I need to understand that a little bit more,

203
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
 can I invite you to go back last week

204
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,000
 and have a listen to that message?

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,800
 But basically that's what we taught.

206
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 There's a biblical mandate for justice.

207
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,920
 It sits at the heart of the gospel.

208
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,720
 It's the restoration of all of those broken contexts.

209
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,400
 So now we stand here in week two,

210
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,360
 and here's the question we should all be asking.

211
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
 If that is true, how should we now live?

212
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,160
 Like, how do I now live in this world if that's the gospel?

213
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,280
 If we here at the Vine are gonna say,

214
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,000
 we're people of the gospel,

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
 if I'm saying that being a person of the gospel

216
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,920
 is to be involved somehow in the restoration of four

217
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,760
 of those relational contexts, how do I now live?

218
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,400
 Like, what should be my agenda?

219
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,960
 What should be my priorities?

220
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,080
 Like, what should I be focused on in the here and now?

221
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,400
 I'm not just waiting till I die to go to heaven.

222
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,160
 Like, I've got something to do now.

223
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,720
 God's peeled the curtain back at the end of all things

224
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,520
 in Revelation 21 and 22.

225
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
 And he's shown us a picture of every knee bowing,

226
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,240
 every tongue and tribe confessing.

227
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,040
 He's shown us a picture where sin is no longer present,

228
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,320
 where the leaves of the trees are for the healing,

229
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,440
 where there's that one tree of the tree of life,

230
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,400
 no more the tree of the knowledge of the new.

231
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
 He's peeled it back, and he's saying to us,

232
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,880
 live on behalf of that vision now.

233
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,920
 So if God's heart is the restoration of all things,

234
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,760
 the renewal of all things, if God's heart is justice,

235
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,240
 how should we now live?

236
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,000
 I wanna challenge us by saying this as direct as I can.

237
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 You cannot call yourself a Christian

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,640
 and remain distant to the injustice in society around you.

239
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,640
 You cannot call yourself a Christian

240
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,000
 if you're not on behalf of the gospel.

241
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,480
 And if the gospel is the restoration

242
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,520
 of all of those broken relational contexts,

243
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,600
 and if justice sits in the heart of that,

244
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,520
 and if that's where God is taking us

245
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,080
 at the end of all things in Revelation 21 and 22,

246
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,560
 if we're not on behalf of that now,

247
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,640
 you should stop calling yourself a Christian.

248
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,680
 Because being centered in Christ

249
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,240
 means that I am centered in a context

250
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,040
 by which it is painful and dying and hurting,

251
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,720
 and sin is doing stuff in it.

252
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,560
 And I stand as a person with Christ in humility,

253
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,600
 knowing I'm not the answer for everything.

254
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,840
 The world is never gonna be perfect until Christ comes back.

255
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,880
 We're living in this now, but not yet,

256
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,520
 but that does not mean I'm mute.

257
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,080
 It does not mean that I haven't got something to say.

258
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,960
 It doesn't mean that the gospel is to wait until he returns.

259
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,040
 No, the gospel has action now.

260
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,840
 And this call upon us as a people of Christ

261
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,680
 is a wonderful thing.

262
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,520
 Paul, when he writes to the church in the New Testament,

263
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,480
 have you ever noticed this?

264
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,640
 Right at the start of the letter,

265
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,800
 he doesn't just say this as it's like a greeting thing.

266
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,360
 He says, "You are in Christ in Ephesus."

267
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,080
 Or he says, "You're in Christ in Colossae,

268
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,480
 "in Christ in Philippi."

269
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,280
 It's basically Paul's way of saying,

270
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,160
 "Don't you realize that your relationship with Jesus

271
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,080
 "is not just in Christ, you're in Christ in a context.

272
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,360
 "You're in Christ in a city.

273
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,800
 "You're in Christ around a whole bunch of people

274
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,080
 "that are desperately in need of the gospel.

275
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,600
 "You're in Christ in Corinth, in Christ in Philippi."

276
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,840
 And I wanna say to you, if you live here in this city,

277
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,440
 you're in Christ in Hong Kong.

278
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,200
 Not just in Christ, as amazing as that is,

279
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,960
 but God has planted you here in Hong Kong.

280
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,000
 He did not do that by mistake.

281
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,800
 None of you, whether you're here for two weeks,

282
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,680
 two months, two years, two decades,

283
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,760
 are here in Hong Kong by mistake.

284
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,600
 Our city desperately needs the gospel.

285
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
 There are injustices at work around us.

286
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,800
 And if we're gonna call ourselves a Christian,

287
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,240
 we're gonna realize that our relationship with Jesus

288
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,400
 has something to say to our context.

289
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,520
 I'm in Christ in Hong Kong.

290
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,960
 That should mean something.

291
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,920
 I had the privilege a number of years ago

292
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,240
 of meeting with one of my justice heroes.

293
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,400
 His name's John Perkins,

294
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,560
 and John Perkins was a contemporary

295
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,720
 of Martin Luther King Jr.

296
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,320
 and was very involved with the civil rights movement

297
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,200
 in the '60s.

298
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,880
 And he was speaking to a small group of us pastors

299
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,120
 at this conference I was at,

300
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,800
 and he said this incredible thing.

301
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,600
 He said that the church of Jesus is always at its best

302
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,400
 when it is a community of hope,

303
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,680
 wrapping its arms around a community of pain.

304
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,240
 And if we're in Christ in Hong Kong,

305
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,560
 and if we're the people of the gospel in this city,

306
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,040
 then we should be asking ourselves,

307
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,120
 we have the hope.

308
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,000
 And we just sung about it.

309
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,520
 The joy of the Lord is our strength.

310
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,440
 Not our great ability to sort out

311
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,320
 all the problems in the world,

312
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,800
 not our wonderful strategies.

313
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,280
 No, our strength is the joy of the gospel.

314
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,760
 The fact that we have been reconciled to God,

315
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,600
 reconciled to ourselves,

316
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,440
 reconciled to others,

317
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,560
 reconciled to creation.

318
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,640
 And we have that message for everyone.

319
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
 And that should motivate us.

320
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,200
 That should put something inside of us.

321
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,880
 That should ask us to go,

322
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,040
 okay, we are the community of hope.

323
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,240
 I get that piece.

324
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,560
 What's the pain?

325
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,320
 Because if we're to be a church

326
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,000
 that's wrapping its arms around the pain,

327
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 we need to know what is the brokenness?

328
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,480
 What is the injustice?

329
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,520
 What is the suffering?

330
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,840
 What is the pain around us

331
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,880
 that we can wrap ourselves around?

332
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,120
 So what I wanna do is just share with you

333
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,560
 just some like high level ideas about that for us

334
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
 and for our city.

335
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,120
 And I wanna do that in the framework

336
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,920
 of this idea of us and God,

337
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,680
 us and ourselves, us and others,

338
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,760
 us and creation.

339
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,680
 Let's start with us and God.

340
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,120
 This one should move your heart immediately.

341
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,720
 Latest government statistics would say

342
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,840
 16% of our city believe Jesus,

343
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,800
 have a relationship with Jesus,

344
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
 or would call themselves Christian.

345
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,320
 16%.

346
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,280
 Now, if you just look at people

347
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,160
 who regularly attend church on a Sunday,

348
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,520
 well done, thank you, you're here,

349
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,800
 that drops to 8%.

350
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,040
 Now, this is a statistic

351
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,160
 that should really move your heart.

352
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,680
 84% of our city do not know Jesus, 84%.

353
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,000
 The church has been in Hong Kong for over 100 years.

354
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,080
 I mean, even longer than that.

355
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,320
 I mean, there's 1700 registered churches

356
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,960
 in our city right now.

357
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,600
 And 84% of the people in this city don't know Jesus,

358
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,640
 that should burn something inside of you.

359
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,960
 That should place a holy discontent inside of us.

360
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,120
 That church is not about some holy huddle

361
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,360
 coming in and experiencing

362
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,560
 what we've experienced here this morning,

363
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,920
 as great as that is.

364
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,320
 And we love gathering here.

365
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,640
 But if this is all it is,

366
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,680
 that 84% is not gonna change.

367
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,520
 What we do when we gather here

368
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,840
 is we are sent ones.

369
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
 We come and we worship and we experience

370
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,040
 and we weep and we cry and we pray

371
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
 and we fill ourselves with love

372
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,440
 so that we then go and serve

373
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,520
 the context we have been placed in.

374
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,080
 That 84% should do something in our spirits.

375
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,040
 What about us and ourselves?

376
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,520
 One of the things that we've noticed recently

377
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,840
 is the mental health related issues in our city

378
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,920
 more than anything.

379
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,800
 And what you can see here is that

380
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,760
 one in six people in Hong Kong

381
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,400
 have what's called common mental health challenges.

382
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,280
 One in six adults in our city.

383
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,160
 When you break that down to just youth,

384
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,920
 six years old to 17, that's one in four.

385
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,960
 60% of the global suicides in the world happen in Asia.

386
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,400
 Hong Kong ranks third on a list, on that list.

387
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,960
 That's a list we do not want to be ranking on.

388
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,680
 We rank third on that list,

389
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,360
 only behind South Korea number one, Japan number two.

390
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,800
 Last year or in 2023,

391
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,320
 there were 1,092 suicides in our city.

392
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,160
 That should do something to us.

393
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,200
 On the mental health side,

394
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,040
 the WHO organization would tell you

395
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
 that you need about 10 psychiatrists

396
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,240
 for every 100,000 people.

397
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,120
 Hong Kong currently has 4.1 psychiatrists.

398
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,560
 I don't know what the .1 is, that's weird.

399
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,240
 But anyway, 4.1 psychiatrists

400
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,080
 to every 100,000 people in our city.

401
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,240
 UBS did a research report recently,

402
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,880
 and they looked at the average working hours in Hong Kong.

403
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,200
 Hong Kong has 50 hours of average work week.

404
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,440
 The global average is 36 hours.

405
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,320
 I want to plant a church in one of the cities

406
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,840
 where 36 hours is the, come on church.

407
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,840
 We live in a city that is driving its people

408
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,200
 way, way too hard.

409
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,680
 What about us and others?

410
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,120
 This is really important that we understand

411
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,000
 the poverty context of our city.

412
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,120
 20% of Hong Kong people

413
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,360
 live below the poverty line in this city.

414
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,640
 We always think Hong Kong is a wealthy place.

415
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,520
 That's one point, almost 1.4 million people

416
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,760
 out of 8 million live under the poverty line

417
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,440
 here in Hong Kong.

418
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,560
 When you take the poorest person in Hong Kong

419
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,760
 and the wealthiest person,

420
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,880
 there's an 81.9X kind of difference between the two.

421
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,480
 Now, here's the crazy thing.

422
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,440
 When you did that statistic in 2019,

423
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,160
 that difference was only 44%.

424
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,440
 So in the last, what, five years,

425
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,400
 it's gone from being a 44% difference

426
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,160
 to an 81.9% difference.

427
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,560
 In other words, Hong Kong is getting further apart

428
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,600
 between the wealthy and the poor.

429
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
 The Gini coefficient is a global standard

430
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,560
 to help to kind of signify the wealth-poor gap.

431
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,560
 Hong Kong's current Gini coefficient is 0.54.

432
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,480
 Zero would be perfectly equal, one being the worst.

433
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,560
 We're right in the middle, 0.54.

434
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,880
 But hear this, that puts us in the top 10

435
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,920
 of places in the world

436
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,000
 in terms of the gap between the poor and the wealthy.

437
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,800
 Right now, it takes 5.3 years on average

438
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,600
 for somebody to get into public housing in Hong Kong.

439
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,720
 200,000 people in our city

440
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,640
 are living in less than 100 square foot.

441
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,880
 Now, here's the thing.

442
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,000
 Special education needs.

443
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,240
 A lot of children in our city

444
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,760
 are struggling under disability or special education needs.

445
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,760
 Currently, right now, there are 50,000 people,

446
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,240
 children, that will require

447
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,240
 at least 12 therapy sessions a year.

448
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,960
 That's a total cost of $430 million,

449
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,400
 and most of that money is not being made available

450
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,480
 in the public sector.

451
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,560
 Now, this should shock us when we realize

452
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,480
 that Hong Kong's current financial fiscal reserves

453
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,080
 is $724.8 billion,

454
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,560
 which will increase to $983 million by 2028.

455
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,160
 That's the prediction.

456
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,880
 In other words, our issue is not resource.

457
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,520
 It's distribution of that resource.

458
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,280
 And what about finally us in creation?

459
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
 Have a look at this.

460
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,040
 Hong Kong currently produces around about 4 million tons

461
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,080
 of what's called metropolis,

462
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,880
 it's kind of like metropolis social waste

463
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,720
 or something like that.

464
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,640
 But it's basically the waste that we create,

465
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,400
 4 million tons of it,

466
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,000
 of which on average is 1.44 kg per person per day.

467
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I'm glad to report that Singapore is higher at 1.88 kg

468
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,560
 per person per day.

469
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,520
 But the joke hides the reality

470
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,640
 that we're still one of the highest.

471
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,800
 That places us within the top 20 cities in the world.

472
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,480
 Now, here's the thing that should really wake us

473
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,400
 as a church, as a community.

474
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,400
 1.3 million tons of that is food waste alone.

475
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,680
 A third of our waste is food waste.

476
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,280
 What that means is that we love to eat,

477
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,400
 we love to order everything on the menu,

478
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,040
 and we do not eat it all.

479
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,840
 I'm gonna say that one more time

480
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,760
 'cause some of us, myself, needed to hear this.

481
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,200
 We love to eat, we order everything on the menu,

482
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,120
 but we do not eat it all.

483
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,160
 And when we're giving a third of our waste is food,

484
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,680
 that needs something for us to be really thinking about.

485
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,560
 On the positive side, I wanna say this.

486
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,240
 The government has done some great work

487
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,360
 in the area of recycling and are continuing

488
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,200
 to do a good work in the area of recycling.

489
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,640
 Right now, about 32% of our created waste a year

490
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,800
 is recycled here in Hong Kong.

491
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
 That's not where we want it to be overall,

492
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,840
 but that is much better than the less than 12%

493
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,400
 some five years ago.

494
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,000
 So Hong Kong has done a good job,

495
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,920
 and the government have some policies in place

496
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,080
 to try to change the recycling dynamics of our city.

497
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,800
 In terms of pollution, 20 days last year,

498
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,400
 we're dedicated as like dangerous levels of pollution.

499
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,120
 We're currently ranked about 63rd, I think it is,

500
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,520
 out of a global index of 138 countries

501
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
 when it comes to pollution.

502
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,280
 So pollution continues to be a challenge in our city.

503
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280
 Now, the reason why I wanna show you some of those things

504
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,120
 is because that's really important that we understand

505
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,680
 what is the pain that we need to be wrapping

506
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,000
 our arms of hope around.

507
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,680
 But when we see statistics like that,

508
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,920
 it would be easy for us to feel a bit despondent.

509
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,280
 It'd be easy for us to feel like,

510
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,280
 well, that's like a lot of bad stuff.

511
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,320
 I don't know how to respond to those statistics, Andrew.

512
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,160
 I don't know what to do.

513
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,960
 I'm feeling pretty weighed down by it.

514
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,800
 And oftentimes what happens for us

515
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
 when we hear stuff like this

516
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,520
 is that we retreat further rather than press in.

517
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,120
 And I wanna say that, yes, the statistics are quite strong,

518
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,400
 but we have to hear this.

519
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,880
 We are the community of hope.

520
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
 Like if anybody has the answer to this,

521
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,560
 then surely it's the local church

522
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,520
 and its partnership with the many NGOs

523
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,040
 that do great work in our city.

524
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,360
 That should be the starting point for our thinking.

525
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,720
 Yes, these statistics are shocking

526
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,000
 and they should shake something within us,

527
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,800
 but not shake us to despondency, shake us to action.

528
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,200
 They should make us wanna stand up more,

529
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,000
 want us to be more Christian in our city,

530
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,800
 want us to live the hope of the gospel more.

531
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,640
 Now you have to understand that for justice to happen

532
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,720
 in areas of injustice in society,

533
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,320
 basically sociologists will tell you

534
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,480
 that four things need to happen.

535
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,480
 Education, connectedness, adaptability, and resource.

536
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,560
 These four things are central to any transformation

537
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,200
 of any brokenness in society.

538
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,280
 Education, connectedness, adaptability, and resource.

539
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,560
 What we have to understand is that we're living in a time

540
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,640
 where all four of those things

541
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,440
 are the best that they've ever been.

542
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,120
 So if these are the four things that are helpful for us

543
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,640
 when it thinks about changing society

544
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,440
 and doing something right within the society around us,

545
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,920
 we gotta realize that those four things,

546
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,040
 I mean, we've never been more educated

547
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,360
 as a generation than right now.

548
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,880
 Our access to education and to information

549
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,040
 has never been higher.

550
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,800
 In fact, all the statistics I just showed you

551
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,640
 on the screen, I got from AI.

552
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,080
 Now I want you, I checked the sources, okay?

553
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,880
 So it wasn't just like hallucinating AI, okay?

554
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,000
 These are good statistics from AI, but I went to AI.

555
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,040
 I mean, we're the most educated generation

556
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,400
 there has ever been.

557
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,160
 We have access to information like never before.

558
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,960
 What about when it comes to this idea of our connectedness?

559
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,280
 We're more connected than we have ever been before.

560
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,800
 Now, yes, there's a whole thing around being more connected,

561
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,240
 but never feeling more alone.

562
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,560
 That's a whole nother sermon we'll come to at some point.

563
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,240
 But the reality is we're more connected amongst each other.

564
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,200
 We have the ability to connect like never before.

565
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,440
 Adaptability, because we have this education

566
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,800
 and connectedness, we are people of the world

567
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,640
 more than we've ever been in terms of global citizenships.

568
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,160
 We understand culture and background and people

569
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,600
 better than ever before.

570
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,640
 We understand the ways in which different nations operate

571
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,560
 better than ever before.

572
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,840
 So we are more adaptable to the realities of our world

573
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,720
 than we've ever been.

574
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,000
 And finally, resource.

575
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,560
 I mean, you just saw in even the statistics for Hong Kong,

576
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,080
 our issue is not resources.

577
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,760
 Incredible amounts of resources.

578
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,800
 There's more resource generated in the world

579
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,160
 than in any other time in history right now.

580
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,440
 But that resource is not going to the places

581
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,600
 where it necessarily needs to go.

582
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,480
 So here's the thing.

583
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,600
 While we might want to be despondent,

584
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,080
 we are actually better equipped now to rise up

585
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,520
 and do the things that we can do to begin to shape the world

586
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,560
 to the gospel like never before.

587
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,320
 The question then is how.

588
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,600
 How do we do it?

589
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,640
 Like we know we've got, follow me, follow me.

590
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,680
 We've got a theological mandate to do it.

591
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,000
 The gospel tells us we should be doing it.

592
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,760
 We know that we are in Christ in context

593
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,640
 and we've been planted here in Hong Kong.

594
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,680
 We've seen that there is pain

595
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,280
 and we are called to be a community of hope.

596
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,320
 How do we do it?

597
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,160
 Like how do we do it?

598
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,680
 Not just on a corporate level, like an institutional level,

599
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,720
 like a church level.

600
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,440
 How do you do it?

601
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,640
 Because every single one of us in this room,

602
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,680
 we have a spirit of influence

603
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,680
 where there is some injustice currently at work.

604
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
 Some of you, it might be your family.

605
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,360
 Maybe there's a breakdown in a relationship

606
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
 in your family right now

607
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,880
 and it's causing a lot of suffering and pain

608
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,320
 within the broader family dynamic.

609
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,280
 Maybe for some of you, it's a school that you attend

610
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,600
 or a university you're a part of

611
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,560
 and you see some things happening there

612
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,000
 that break your heart.

613
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,960
 Maybe you're working for an organization or a corporate

614
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,720
 and you know that there are practices happening

615
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,320
 within your business that you know is creating a bigger gap

616
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,160
 between the wealthy and the poor.

617
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,000
 Or whatever it might be,

618
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,960
 for all of us it will look different,

619
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,000
 but every single one of us,

620
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,160
 we are in Christ in that company,

621
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,640
 in Christ in that family,

622
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,480
 in Christ in that context,

623
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,320
 and we have to do something.

624
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,200
 What is it that we do?

625
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,480
 Okay, so to help you,

626
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,680
 I wanna just, in the time I've got left,

627
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,440
 just show you a really short, quick model

628
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,800
 of how we can actually live more justly

629
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,280
 based on what we've been talking about.

630
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,360
 And I wanna do it, of course,

631
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,560
 by looking at Jesus and this moment in Jesus's life.

632
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,280
 And I think in this moment in Jesus's life,

633
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,080
 Jesus models for us how we can approach our context,

634
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,160
 our sphere of movements,

635
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,480
 whatever justice issue might be there for us.

636
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,200
 And in this beautiful moment of Jesus's life,

637
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,000
 he shows us four things that he does.

638
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,240
 And I'm just gonna break these down real fast.

639
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,400
 This is out of, I'm gonna turn back to it.

640
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,560
 It's out of Luke chapter 19.

641
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,560
 This is his triumphal entry as he enters into Jerusalem.

642
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,680
 Notice what it says here.

643
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,360
 This is Luke 19, starting in verse 41 to verse 44.

644
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,600
 As Jesus approached Jerusalem,

645
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,000
 he saw the city and he wept over it.

646
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,240
 And he said this,

647
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,440
 "If you, even you had known on this day

648
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,720
 "what would bring you peace,

649
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,000
 "but now it is hidden from your eyes.

650
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,280
 "For the days will come upon you

651
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,920
 "when your enemies will build an embankment against you

652
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,720
 "and encircle you and hem you in on every side.

653
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,160
 "They will dash you to the ground,

654
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,040
 "you and the children within your walls.

655
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,360
 "They will not leave one stone on another

656
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,960
 "because you did not recognize

657
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,080
 "the time of God's coming for you."

658
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,440
 This is a significant moment in Jesus's ministry.

659
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,520
 We know from the scriptures

660
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,960
 that Jesus had a long relationship with Jerusalem.

661
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,640
 In fact, he was there at eight days old meeting there

662
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,400
 and Simeon and Anna prayed over him, prophesied over him.

663
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,520
 We know that he was back there for his bar mitzvah

664
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,400
 when he was about 13,

665
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,400
 where he stayed behind at the temple

666
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,600
 and his parents lost him, a nightmare for them.

667
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,800
 And he had to be in his father's house, that whole thing.

668
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,160
 But we also know that from the beginning

669
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,520
 of his actual ministry,

670
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,160
 Jesus has specifically stayed away from Jerusalem.

671
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,520
 He's been ministering in Galilee and Samaria

672
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,400
 and the surrounding areas,

673
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,920
 but he's been staying away from Jerusalem.

674
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,480
 And he's been staying away from Jerusalem

675
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,560
 'cause he understands that when he gets to Jerusalem,

676
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,760
 things will begin, things will precipitate

677
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,280
 towards the cross.

678
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,720
 And he knows because of that,

679
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,520
 he needs to make sure that he does the work

680
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,400
 that he's been called to do before he gets there.

681
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,800
 And so the turning point in the gospel of Luke

682
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,280
 is when Jesus says to the disciples,

683
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,320
 "Who do people say I am?"

684
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,800
 And the disciples respond, they say,

685
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
 well, Peter responds, he says,

686
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,520
 "You're the Christ, you're the Messiah."

687
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,880
 And then Luke records for us

688
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,480
 that it was from that moment

689
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,560
 that Jesus sets his face towards Jerusalem,

690
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,280
 walking, wanting to now be and reconnect with his city.

691
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,160
 And here Luke describes the moment

692
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,840
 where Jesus crests up the hill of Mount Olives

693
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,520
 and looks upon his city for the first time

694
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,880
 in what was probably a number of years.

695
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,080
 And it says here, he does four things.

696
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,120
 I wanna show you what these four things are

697
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,320
 because these become the kind of nucleus

698
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,720
 of a model for justice for each one of us.

699
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,720
 The first thing Luke says is that he approaches.

700
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,560
 Now that might sound like not a big deal on itself,

701
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,320
 but I want you to think about this.

702
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,680
 Jesus, again, he understood that when he gets to Jerusalem,

703
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,400
 things are gonna kind of happen

704
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,760
 that will lead him to his death.

705
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,800
 He understands that when he gets there,

706
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,760
 the people in the triumphal entry

707
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,560
 who were shouting, "Hosanna, Hosanna,"

708
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,280
 would later be the ones that would be shouting,

709
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,920
 "Crucify him."

710
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,440
 He knew that what he was about to say

711
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,120
 and do around the temple

712
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,960
 was going to basically give people the excuse

713
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,000
 that they needed to try to get him hung on a Roman cross.

714
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,320
 But Jesus still approaches.

715
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,320
 And this is really important

716
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,840
 because Jesus understands the pain that is about to come,

717
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,960
 but he doesn't stay away.

718
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,960
 In other words, Jesus makes a priority of proximity.

719
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,680
 He says, "I'm gonna come to this city now

720
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,360
 at the right time and the right way,

721
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,320
 but I'm gonna approach it

722
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,000
 even though I know it's gonna be painful,

723
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,600
 even though I know it's gonna be hard,

724
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,120
 even though I know I'm gonna get rejected,

725
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,040
 even though ultimately it's gonna lead to my death,

726
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,400
 and everything inside of me would want me to stay away

727
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,160
 and just judge Jerusalem from Galilee.

728
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,440
 I'm not gonna do that."

729
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,320
 And he puts himself in a place of proximity with his city.

730
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,880
 For some of you, there's a justice issue,

731
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,760
 an injustice in your family,

732
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,560
 an injustice in your workplace,

733
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,640
 and it scares you to think

734
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,200
 that you might need to be involved in it.

735
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,160
 And that's understandable

736
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,120
 'cause these things can be tough and scary.

737
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,880
 But what Jesus models for us immediately is proximity.

738
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,200
 The whole gospel is a relationship gospel.

739
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,760
 And one of the things that Christians are really bad at

740
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,800
 is talking on behalf of the poor

741
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,520
 without knowing any of the poor.

742
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,040
 Talking on behalf of the vulnerable,

743
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,360
 the trafficked, the marginalized,

744
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,680
 without even knowing any of them,

745
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,600
 having never met them, having never seen them,

746
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,320
 having never put themselves in a place

747
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,600
 of understanding their suffering and their pain,

748
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,040
 but just standing back and saying,

749
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,600
 "Well, I guess I should speak for them."

750
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,080
 But then we speak for them in dangerous ways.

751
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,280
 Jesus draws near.

752
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,200
 Some of you, it's gonna be painful to draw near,

753
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,440
 but we have to always put proximity over productivity.

754
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,800
 Productivity without proximity leads to pain.

755
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,440
 But when we are close, when we approach,

756
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,360
 we find ourselves in a place

757
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,520
 where we can begin to do something.

758
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,680
 What does Jesus do?

759
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,040
 Well, the next thing it says is that he sees Jerusalem.

760
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:53,320
 I love this because at first, this is physical.

761
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,360
 He's just come up and he's crested the Mount Olives

762
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,280
 and he looks upon it and said,

763
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,400
 now what he would have seen, I've actually done,

764
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,720
 you can go to Jerusalem

765
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,960
 and actually do the walk that Jesus did.

766
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,840
 And you go up there and you see the olive trees

767
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,880
 that are still there around the area of Mount Olives.

768
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,080
 They're still there to this day.

769
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,520
 And then you can look on the view that Jesus had.

770
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,200
 And it's relatively similar.

771
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,240
 There's still the walls of the old city there.

772
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,040
 There's the old city on Mount Zion.

773
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,960
 There's the, now it's a mosque, of course,

774
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,440
 but in Jesus's day, there was the temple right there.

775
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,160
 So you can kind of get a sense of what Jesus was seeing.

776
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,080
 And he crests and he physically sees what's before him.

777
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,200
 Now, what I've done for you here in this message

778
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,840
 is I've enabled you to crest a hill

779
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,600
 and physically see some things

780
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,320
 that are happening in Hong Kong.

781
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,200
 Statistics, stuff that's important for us to be aware of,

782
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,760
 stuff happening in mental health in our city,

783
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,280
 stuff happening in the pollution index and all that stuff.

784
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,640
 So all that stuff we went through,

785
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,760
 that was us physically seeing what's happening in our city.

786
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,920
 Does that make sense?

787
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,320
 Now, here's the thing though.

788
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,840
 If that's all we do, just physically see

789
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,560
 the stuff that's happening in our city,

790
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,200
 educate ourselves and get good statistics,

791
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,320
 that's all helpful.

792
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,560
 But if that's all we ever do,

793
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,560
 we're no better than a secular NGO.

794
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:08,360
 The thing that makes us Christians

795
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,960
 is we do what then Jesus does,

796
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,560
 which he doesn't just see physically,

797
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,040
 but he sees spiritually.

798
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,280
 'Cause he looks over his city physically,

799
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
 but then he sees prophetically

800
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,920
 what's gonna happen to that city in 70 AD.

801
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,480
 He sees Emperor Nero coming in

802
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,320
 and destroying many of the Christians,

803
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,440
 killing many of the people.

804
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,560
 And he says, "If only you knew the peace

805
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,920
 "that comes before you now,

806
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,720
 "but it's hidden from you."

807
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,640
 So he doesn't just see the physical realities,

808
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,200
 he sees the spiritual stuff

809
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
 and not just the spiritual bad stuff,

810
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,480
 but also the spiritual good stuff,

811
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,120
 the hope that is there.

812
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,360
 And what we're modeled here by Jesus

813
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,160
 is that we're called to approach,

814
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,040
 be proximate, be in relationship,

815
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,600
 but we're also called to see physically,

816
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,960
 educate yourself, learn about the issue,

817
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,800
 know the statistics, but then pray and say,

818
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,720
 "Lord, what breaks your heart?"

819
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,000
 Because I see that there are 60%

820
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,560
 of the global suicides in Asia,

821
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,640
 and I see that Hong Kong is third on that list,

822
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,920
 and that does something to me.

823
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,040
 But Lord, I come to you

824
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,440
 'cause I wanna see this issue from your eyes now.

825
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,160
 I wanna get a burden in my heart

826
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,280
 for what breaks your heart.

827
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,160
 We sang it earlier, didn't we?

828
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,320
 Give me a heart that is after your heart.

829
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,880
 That's the seeing spiritually, not just physically.

830
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,680
 Otherwise, we're no better than a secular NGO.

831
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,520
 And we're the church that has the hope of the world

832
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,840
 and the gospel of life.

833
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,160
 Then Jesus does this next thing.

834
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,680
 Luke describes him as weeping.

835
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,640
 He weeps.

836
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,080
 Now, the Greek word that Luke uses is kaleo.

837
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,760
 It literally means loud wailing or big sobbing.

838
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,600
 Like, in other words,

839
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
 Jesus has not crest that hill

840
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,200
 and look at Jerusalem and go.

841
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,080
 He crest that hill,

842
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,720
 and remember, he's surrounded by people,

843
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,280
 and he starts wailing.

844
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,640
 And I can imagine him shaking his fist

845
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,680
 and he's crying.

846
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,240
 Maybe he falls to his knees.

847
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,560
 We don't know exactly what happened,

848
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,680
 but there's a kaleo taking place in this man.

849
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,560
 He's not just wiping away a couple of tears.

850
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,280
 He is publicly travailing for his people.

851
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,720
 He's feeling something inside of him

852
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,640
 for their pain, their suffering, their struggles.

853
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,720
 A man who's about to experience the greatest pain of all,

854
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,400
 he's first kind of on his knees

855
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,160
 on behalf of people that are suffering.

856
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,040
 This is the idea of empathy.

857
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,440
 I want you to see this because this is really important.

858
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,680
 When we approach and we see,

859
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,680
 and if we stop at see,

860
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,760
 what we've experienced is sympathy.

861
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,880
 Oh, okay.

862
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,680
 Yeah, Andrew showed some statistics today

863
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,080
 about suicides in Hong Kong.

864
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,800
 Man, yeah, I'm kind of bummed about that.

865
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,880
 You know, like that's not great.

866
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,920
 Yeah, man, I'm glad I know that now.

867
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,200
 But that's just sympathy.

868
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,240
 Jesus moves from sympathy to a place of empathy.

869
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,400
 Empathy is like, I wanna feel what those parents have felt

870
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,800
 when their child has killed themselves.

871
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,800
 I wanna feel what those that are trafficked

872
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,760
 into our city are feeling in terms of what's going on.

873
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,480
 And they're like, I wanna have some.

874
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,720
 And look, you cannot have empathy unless you approach.

875
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,760
 Are you following this?

876
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,280
 You can't have this unless you've done a bit of this.

877
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,880
 You've gotta understand the issue,

878
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,200
 but then you've gotta make sure that you feel it.

879
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,360
 This is where prayer also becomes very important.

880
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,200
 We weep.

881
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,240
 Now that doesn't mean some of us

882
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,520
 will actually literally weep,

883
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,960
 but we can weep in our spirit.

884
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,480
 There's a holy discontent inside of me

885
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,920
 that this world is not as Christ would want it to be,

886
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,120
 that there is not the shalom

887
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,760
 that Jesus died on the cross for.

888
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,200
 And that moves me, that does something to me.

889
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,480
 And I cry out in that place of pain

890
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,560
 to the one that can only fix it.

891
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,480
 So this weeping of Jesus was central

892
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,440
 to this work of justice that he was about to do.

893
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,480
 But notice, he then speaks.

894
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,600
 Now this is really great,

895
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,520
 'cause eventually Jesus then after weeping,

896
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,280
 after approaching and being proximate,

897
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,120
 seeing physically and spiritually and empathizing,

898
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,840
 he then moves into what I would say is compassion.

899
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,640
 See, empathy without action is just empathy.

900
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,040
 Empathy with action is compassion.

901
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,080
 It's like we've taken this place of empathy

902
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,520
 and we've begun to actually do something, work something,

903
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,160
 say something, be something, act in a certain way,

904
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,840
 suddenly have different consuming habits,

905
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,000
 suddenly recycle more at home.

906
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,520
 Whatever it might be, it might be a small thing

907
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,360
 or a big thing, but we've begun to,

908
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,720
 hey, I've approached this issue,

909
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,440
 I've seen it physically and spiritually,

910
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,040
 I've felt something for it,

911
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,960
 there's something in my spirit that's not right about it.

912
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,840
 I've brought it to Jesus, I'm praying,

913
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,480
 but I'm also now going to speak, act, do something

914
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,160
 that aligns myself to being a person of the gospel,

915
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,520
 one that restores all of those break-on relational contexts.

916
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,680
 That's what I want to do.

917
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,120
 So Jesus provides for us, I think, simply and beautifully,

918
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,320
 this model that we can all apply into our lives,

919
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,000
 whether it's a big issue or a small issue,

920
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,960
 something in our family, something in our workplace,

921
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,040
 the first thing we should do is I want to approach.

922
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,920
 But here's the problem a lot of Christians make,

923
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,120
 the mistake we make, we approach

924
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,840
 and we jump straight to speak.

925
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,480
 Oh, we love to do this as Christians.

926
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,200
 Like we like to show up somewhere and approach something

927
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,000
 and just tell everybody what we think about it.

928
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,840
 I tell you what, there is a lot of damage

929
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,760
 that has been done over church history

930
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,240
 by Christians that have approached really important issues

931
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,800
 and just begun to speak

932
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,040
 and have bypassed what Jesus models for us.

933
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,600
 Jesus didn't just approach his city

934
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,800
 and begin to declare something over them,

935
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,920
 even though he had every right to do so,

936
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,640
 Jesus shows us something.

937
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,200
 Now, here's the next thing though,

938
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,760
 a lot of Christians might approach

939
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,040
 and then educate themselves about the issue

940
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,440
 and then they jump straight to speaking.

941
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,080
 That's even worse because this one is ignorance.

942
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,960
 And there's some damage that can be done through ignorance,

943
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,040
 but I tell you what, this is judgment.

944
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,480
 And a lot of damage is done

945
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,040
 through the church through judgment.

946
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,160
 'Cause it's like I've approached, I've learned,

947
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,520
 I've seen there's a physical, there's a spiritual,

948
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,240
 and now let me tell you what God thinks about your sin.

949
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,360
 Let me tell you what God thinks about your brokenness.

950
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,160
 And we become a church that wags its finger.

951
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,600
 Jesus doesn't show up to his city

952
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,240
 and he's got some pretty strong things to say to them.

953
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,200
 He's about to go to the temple

954
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,280
 and like whip people around, okay?

955
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,920
 Like this is not safe, cuddly Jesus time.

956
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,440
 He's got some strong stuff to say,

957
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,600
 but I want you to see something.

958
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,280
 He does not approach, see, and then jump straight to speak.

959
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,840
 Jesus weeps, he feels something.

960
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,720
 He allows to put himself in the pain of the people

961
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,760
 that he sees spiritually.

962
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,960
 He feels that emotion inside of him so that he knows,

963
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,560
 man, this is what the pain is like.

964
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,320
 This is what the brokenness is like.

965
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,280
 Man, I'm not gonna stand from a distance

966
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,800
 and judge with a finger.

967
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,720
 I'm on my knees 'cause I feel it with them.

968
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,760
 I feel the longing inside of them for their freedom.

969
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,960
 Lord, would you bring them free?

970
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,000
 But notice also, Jesus doesn't just stop at the weeping.

971
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,840
 I think we do this as a church as well.

972
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,760
 Oh, we come in on a Sunday, Lord,

973
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,000
 Lord, save our city.

974
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,400
 And then we never share the gospel with anyone.

975
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:23,920
 See, the problem is we can get paralysis by analysis.

976
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,240
 Are you with me?

977
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,800
 And we can get paralysis by being over-emotional.

978
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,040
 Jesus goes all the way through that and then he speaks.

979
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,040
 He allows the thing to impact and affect him.

980
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,600
 And then he stands up and he says,

981
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,760
 oh, Jerusalem, that only you knew.

982
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,600
 And then he begins to act in ways throughout the whole week

983
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
 that would reinforce the gospel

984
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,960
 that he's bringing the hope of the world.

985
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,520
 And then he goes to the cross and then he rises

986
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,560
 and he changes everything.

987
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,960
 My friends, whether you have a problem in your family,

988
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,880
 whether you see an injustice at work,

989
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,720
 whether there's something in those statistics

990
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,960
 where you're like, I wanna learn more about that.

991
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,200
 Can I say that this applies to it all?

992
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,320
 Don't be distant.

993
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,800
 Educate yourself, but don't forget to pray.

994
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,840
 Feel what it is that's going on for the people of our city.

995
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,160
 Learn from their perspective, hear their voices,

996
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,760
 understand their pain.

997
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,280
 And then by the guidance of the Holy Spirit,

998
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,080
 do what he calls you to do.

999
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,680
 Approach, see, weep, speak.

1000
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,920
 When we do that, we begin to show the world the whole gospel.

1001
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,680
 Amen, amen.

1002
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,600
 [congregation applauding]

1003
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,400
 All right, can I invite you to stand?

1004
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,720
 I wanna pray for us here this morning.

1005
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,240
 I wonder whether you just quiet your heart,

1006
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,840
 open your hands,

1007
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,920
 just allow the Holy Spirit just to speak to you.

1008
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,120
 Lord, I wanna pray that you would show each person here

1009
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,360
 just one thing in their sphere of influence.

1010
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,840
 Maybe some of you in this room,

1011
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,480
 you know what it is immediately,

1012
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,080
 where there's an injustice around you

1013
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,280
 that you know the Holy Spirit might be wanting to use you in.

1014
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,160
 But perhaps for many of us, we're not aware immediately.

1015
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,080
 Just take a moment.

1016
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,840
 Come Holy Spirit, come.

1017
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,120
 Father, I pray that you would speak.

1018
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,200
 I pray that you would show.

1019
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,960
 Lord, I thank you that every single person here,

1020
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,800
 they're not perfect.

1021
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,680
 They're not gonna have all the answers

1022
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,040
 or they're gonna make mistakes along the way.

1023
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,120
 I've made plenty.

1024
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,400
 But Lord, I pray that they would approach, see, weep,

1025
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,120
 and speak with courage and boldness

1026
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,360
 as your Spirit leads them.

1027
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,120
 Lord, I pray that this would change those statistics

1028
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,920
 that we looked at today.

1029
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,360
 Lord, we're not satisfied with just 16% of our city

1030
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,360
 knowing you.

1031
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,400
 Lord, would you bring revival in Hong Kong?

1032
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,800
 Lord, we're not satisfied with the mental health issue.

1033
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,760
 We had a viral pandemic.

1034
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,960
 We have a mental health pandemic now.

1035
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,120
 Lord, would you do help us to be people who weep

1036
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,200
 with our brothers and sisters

1037
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,840
 that are struggling in this time?

1038
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,120
 We thank you for work like Oasis

1039
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,560
 and other things that the Vine does to help in that space.

1040
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,680
 But Lord, would you give us a fresh voice?

1041
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,000
 Father, I wanna pray particularly for the weeping

1042
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 for people in this room.

1043
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Not a weeping that leads to sorrow, that leads to retreat,

1044
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,480
 but a weeping that is a godly sorrow

1045
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,480
 that catalyzes into action.

1046
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,440
 And Father, as we find that within us by your Spirit,

1047
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,320
 not made by our own strength,

1048
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,040
 Father, we thank you that empathy moves to compassion.

1049
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,040
 And we thank you that in whatever area

1050
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,920
 that you might be leading us into,

1051
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,800
 we can play a part for the whole gospel in our city.

1052
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,960
 Lord, I pray that this would be a fire lit for the Vine

1053
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,320
 in the season that we're in.

1054
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,760
 May it be for your glory and your glory alone.

1055
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,280
 And everyone here says, amen.

1056
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,120
 Amen.
