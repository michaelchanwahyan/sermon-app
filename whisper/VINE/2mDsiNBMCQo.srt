00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 A couple of weeks ago, I was at a cocktail party, and despite being an extrovert, I don't

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,280
 actually love cocktail parties.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,960
 And one of the reasons is because, you know what it's like when you're at a cocktail party,

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,520
 you get a little glass of wine, and you're kind of walking around, you're mingling, and

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,560
 inevitably you're going to come up and meet somebody that you don't know, a complete stranger.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,960
 And you know in Hong Kong, if you meet a stranger at a cocktail party, and you're doing a little

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,920
 kind of small talk to begin with, you know within about 60 seconds, the inevitable Hong

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,120
 Kong question will be asked.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,080
 Do you know what that question is?

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,520
 So what do you do?

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,840
 Yes, that is the inevitable Hong Kong question.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,040
 And I think there are two reasons why I do not like this question.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,700
 Here's the first reason, because normally when this question is asked by somebody to

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,840
 somebody else, it's because they're trying to construct a social hierarchy and trying

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,440
 to understand, are you more important or am I more important than you?

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,720
 So are you a lawyer, a banker, or something like that?

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,360
 Or are you just something else?

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,560
 I want to know, where are we in the social hierarchy of things?

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,900
 So people ask that question to find out exactly where they are.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,800
 So what do you do is essentially a question to find out if they're better than you.

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,920
 Here's the thing I've discovered.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,900
 The people that ask that question the fastest are the ones who are most proud about their

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,320
 answer.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,280
 Here's the second reason why I don't like this question, because I don't like my answer.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,000
 Now don't get me wrong, I love being a pastor, okay?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,620
 I love this job, it is my life, I am proud, not ashamed of being a pastor.

27
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,400
 But there's something uncomfortable about a cocktail party and pastors.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,920
 Nobody expects to meet a pastor at a cocktail party.

29
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,000
 They're like, "If I go to a church, I could expect to meet a pastor, right?

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,600
 But I don't want to go to a cocktail party and meet a pastor."

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,260
 It's awkward because people immediately think I'm going to do one of two things.

32
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:08,260
 They think either one, I'm like a Jedi master who immediately knows everything bad they

33
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,440
 have ever done, right?

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,720
 And they're like totally kind of freaking out that I'm reading all of the past mistakes

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,960
 that they've made, right?

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,400
 The second thing is they think I'm going to be some like used car salesman and I'm going

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,840
 to try to sell them religion for the next five minutes of which they want nothing to

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
 do with.

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,880
 So more often than not, if they ask me what I do and I say I'm a pastor, that's a very

40
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,320
 quick way to shut down the conversation.

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:39,800
 It's literally like me saying, "I'm a cannibal, would you like to come over for lunch?"

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,780
 So I've devised a new question that I ask at cocktail parties.

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,320
 So there I am with my glass of wine mingling in a cocktail party and there are some strangers

44
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,320
 coming up to me and we're about to embrace in a conversation.

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,600
 And before they can ask me, "So what do you do?"

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,020
 I ask them now a different question.

47
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,040
 So I was at this cocktail party a couple of weeks ago.

48
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,360
 This very businessy looking guy comes up to me, we start chatting.

49
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,040
 Before he can even begin to get there, I say this to him.

50
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,920
 I say, "So in your business here in Hong Kong, what's the number one goal that you have for

51
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,400
 your business?"

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,140
 I don't want to know what you do.

53
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,060
 He replied, he was taken aback, he was like, "Oh, good question."

54
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:25,380
 He was like, "I guess it's to make profit for my shareholders."

55
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,540
 So then I follow up with another question.

56
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,500
 I say, "Well, for the people that you have, what's the number one thing they can do to

57
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,540
 contribute to that goal?"

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,620
 And he said, "I guess that would be to take calculated risk."

59
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,620
 Interesting.

60
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,420
 Now, I did all that because I knew that he was going to ask me the question back, right?

61
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,620
 And sure enough, within about a minute, he's like, "So tell me in your business in Hong

62
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,580
 Kong, what is the number one goal that you have for your business?"

63
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,160
 And I'm like, "Funny that you ask."

64
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,500
 I said, "Well, in my business here in Hong Kong, we want people in Hong Kong to flourish.

65
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,740
 We want them to have the best life that they can have."

66
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,140
 And he's like, "What's the number one thing that your people can do to ensure that that

67
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,140
 happens for them?"

68
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,260
 You want to know what I said?

69
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,460
 Take courage.

70
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,540
 Have courage.

71
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,140
 You need to know, every single one of you in this room, that I'm a pastor because of

72
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,140
 you.

73
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,700
 What I do is on your behalf.

74
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,980
 I love every single one of you.

75
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,500
 The ones that I know really well in this room, the ones that I don't even know well, the

76
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,180
 strangers who have just shown up today, I still love you too.

77
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:40,300
 And my 100% heart is that I want you to live the life that you have been created for.

78
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,820
 And if you are going to live the life that God has created you for, that is going to

79
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,540
 demand courage.

80
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,420
 If your life doesn't scare you, you should get a new life.

81
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,080
 Because you have been created to live a life that brings glory to Christ.

82
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,240
 You have been created to live a life that actually shows the world what human flourishing

83
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,420
 is all about.

84
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,620
 You have been called to be in Hong Kong in this time as somebody who can be a purveyor

85
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,440
 of the hope and the justice and the love and the mercy and the power and the glory of Jesus.

86
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,060
 And that will take courage for you to stand up in your workplace and say, "This is what

87
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
 I believe in."

88
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,220
 For some of us, it'll take courage to take an ethical stance when everybody else around

89
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,180
 us is going in the other direction.

90
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,780
 Some of us, it'll take courage to not be ashamed for the gospel when we're in an environment

91
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,540
 that doesn't embrace that gospel.

92
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,060
 The life you've been called to live is not a passive, boring life.

93
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:49,300
 You've been created for a life that demands courage.

94
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,760
 I think our greatest danger for Christians in Hong Kong in this hour that we're in is

95
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:04,820
 to see the kind of radical gospel-centered life that we want and yet fail to embrace

96
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,660
 it because we lack the one ingredient that is needed for every decision to get us to

97
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,260
 that life.

98
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,100
 And that is the ingredients of courage.

99
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,860
 I want to talk to you today about the kind of life that I think God has for you.

100
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,900
 And I want to inspire you to rise up in courage.

101
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,980
 The good news is that the Bible has a whole lot to say about this idea of courage.

102
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,500
 In fact, in Scripture, courage is connected into three things.

103
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,260
 If you look through the breadth of Scripture in this topic of courage, you'll find that

104
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,940
 it connects in three primary areas, in fear, in failure, and in faith.

105
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,060
 These are the three things that connect to the topic of courage in Scripture.

106
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,580
 I want to start with the first one, fear, because I think it's the most critical.

107
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,220
 Now I want you to think about if there was this kind of line or this spectrum, and if

108
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:08,540
 you have courage on this side of the spectrum, what do you think sits on the other end of

109
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,540
 it?

110
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,820
 In other words, what is the opposite of courage?

111
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,060
 The majority of us think that the opposite of courage is fear.

112
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,420
 We think fear is on the other end of courage.

113
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:24,940
 And in order for us to have courage to flourish in life, we have to first of all kind of get

114
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,420
 rid of fear.

115
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,180
 Once we can get rid of fear, then we can be courageous.

116
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,260
 But the Bible is very clear that the opposite of courage is not fear.

117
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,580
 Fear is actually not your enemy.

118
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,420
 Fear is an emotion created by God, which actually has some great benefits for your life.

119
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
 Fear is not your enemy.

120
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,900
 The opposite of courage is not fear.

121
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,220
 The opposite of courage, according to Scripture, is this idea of cowardice.

122
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,480
 That's the opposite of courage, cowardice.

123
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,940
 If courage is making positive choices and decisions so you can live the life that God

124
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:07,940
 has created you to live, cowardice is making poor decisions, making weak decisions that

125
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,660
 take you away from the kind of life that Christ has called you to.

126
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,180
 Fear is not the opposite of courage.

127
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,060
 Fear actually sits between courage and cowardice.

128
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,180
 Fear is the vehicle that will take you in one direction or another.

129
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,720
 Let me say it this way.

130
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:34,060
 No one has ever been courageous without first facing fear.

131
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:40,620
 Likewise, fear has the power to drive you towards cowardice.

132
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,940
 In fact, fear in its nature can always be so overwhelming to us that if we let it dictate

133
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,260
 our thinking, if we let it dictate how we think about the world, how we think about

134
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,460
 God, how we think about ourselves, it's more often than not going to take us towards cowardice

135
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,660
 rather than in the other direction.

136
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,820
 But actually, courage created by God as this kind of emotion at work in us can be a reminder

137
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,700
 to us that it's time for us to step up.

138
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,860
 Fear can be a reminder to us that actually we do face difficulties in life, but we have

139
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,180
 a God who overcomes those difficulties.

140
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,940
 Fear in other words can be a great catalyst towards courage.

141
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,260
 Fear is not the enemy of courage.

142
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,660
 Fear is the way in which you either become more of a coward or more courageous.

143
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,940
 Are you with me?

144
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,300
 I love the way that Nelson Mandela put it as he was writing about courage.

145
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,300
 He said this, "I learned that courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over

146
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
 it.

147
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,140
 And it is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who has conquered that fear."

148
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,580
 In fact, I would put it in a slightly different way for you.

149
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:52,900
 I would say this, "Your greatest moments of courage will happen when you're feeling fear."

150
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,700
 Your greatest moments, your greatest actions of courage in your life will always happen

151
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,780
 when you're still wrestling with the reality of fear in your life.

152
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:08,340
 May fear propel us to those moments of great courage.

153
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,980
 The Bible also talks about failure.

154
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:15,180
 Now failure is a big thing because failure has the power of course to lead us towards

155
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,780
 cowardice every time.

156
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:22,580
 Your brokenness in your past, the mistakes you have made can so easily shape our thinking

157
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:28,540
 towards the actions in our lives and push us towards cowardice, making weaker decisions

158
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,220
 about our future based on the mistakes or the failures that we've had in our past.

159
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,380
 Some of you in this room, you're making decisions about your future primarily through the lens

160
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,060
 of a failure of your past.

161
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,260
 Failure will push you towards cowardice.

162
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,820
 But equally, failure can move you towards even greater moments of courage.

163
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,060
 Because when you realize that that had happened in your past, but your past doesn't define

164
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,460
 you, when you come to understand that God or God alone defines you, when you come to

165
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,060
 realize that your future is good because Christ is involved in your yesterday, today, and

166
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,380
 forever, then you can take the failures of your past and you can release them and process

167
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,300
 them and give them to the Spirit of God and it can actually propel you to greater moments

168
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,420
 in your future.

169
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,380
 The same with faith.

170
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,940
 Or if the opposite of faith, maybe the opposite of faith would be something like self-doubt.

171
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,220
 How we doubt ourselves and the ways in which, oops, I write in tongues, you need to pray

172
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,660
 for an interpretation, everybody.

173
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,780
 That is the reality that when we don't think enough of ourselves, we don't think of ourselves

174
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,180
 in the way that God thinks about us, and because of things that have happened in our past,

175
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,340
 we don't have that faith to believe that we can do anything good in the future, of course,

176
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,060
 that's going to take us to cowardice.

177
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,700
 And yet also, once we realize that actually in our doubting of ourselves, Christ has redefined

178
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,300
 us with a new name, redefined us as a person who can move in the power of His Spirit, then

179
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,540
 we can begin to head towards courage.

180
00:11:53,540 --> 00:12:00,020
 So fear, failure, faith and self-doubt are all actually helpful.

181
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,340
 They're realities in our life that will take us in one direction or another.

182
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:10,900
 And let me say this, the greatest moments of your courage will come in the presence

183
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,140
 of fear, in the pain of your failure and in the process of faith.

184
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,540
 I'm going to say that one more time.

185
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,820
 Your greatest moments of courage are going to come in the presence of fear, in the pain

186
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,620
 of your failure and in the processing of your faith and self-doubt.

187
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,140
 Those will be the things that will bring you alive.

188
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,560
 I want to be honest with you guys today.

189
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,580
 I am a recovering coward.

190
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:43,900
 In fact, I would tell you in my 20s, in particularly my 20s and into my 30s, fear defined a lot

191
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
 of my life.

192
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,900
 I struggled with anxiety.

193
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,340
 I'm going to talk a little bit more about this in a couple of weeks' time when we do

194
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,820
 a series on mental health.

195
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,020
 And I really struggled with that anxiety in my 20s and that caused me to make weak decisions

196
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,660
 about my future.

197
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,780
 I've been honest with you guys as a church about my failures and the issues that I have

198
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,740
 in my own sort of insecurities that I have around the mistakes that I've made in my life

199
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,300
 and how those can also make me a coward.

200
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,100
 I've been pretty honest with you guys about some of the ways in which I've struggled with

201
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
 faith over the years.

202
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,820
 When my father passed away four years ago, I was wracked with this horrible feeling of

203
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,700
 not trusting God anymore, being angry at God and wrestling with the self-doubt about even

204
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,260
 my faith as a pastor and what that meant.

205
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,180
 I've struggled deeply with these things.

206
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,660
 I would say I'm a recovering coward.

207
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,620
 And I wonder whether some of you also in this room would resonate with that.

208
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,340
 I wonder if we'd all recognize that there are moments of cowardice in us all.

209
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,540
 And if you're feeling like that, guess what?

210
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,100
 You're in a really good place.

211
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,420
 Why?

212
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,780
 Because the Bible is a story of cowards.

213
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,140
 It's funny.

214
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,820
 When we read the Bible, we often think that the Bible actually is a story about incredibly

215
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,020
 naturally brave men and women.

216
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,840
 We read the stories of some of the biblical characters and we sort of convince ourselves

217
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,820
 that they were just naturally amazing people, just amazing peoples in history who rose up

218
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,820
 and did great things.

219
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,220
 The reality, if you look between the lines of scripture, is that pretty much every single

220
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,780
 person that God chooses, every single person that God speaks to, every single person that

221
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,660
 God is working with is a recovering coward.

222
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,820
 Everybody is struggling with fear, struggling with anxiety, and it's pushing them towards

223
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,220
 cowardice and God comes along and says, "I'm going to use you anyway."

224
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,740
 Here's the amazing thing about God.

225
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:34,700
 God chooses those who would never choose themselves.

226
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,820
 And God does this because He's revealing something about His glory and something about who He

227
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,820
 is.

228
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,660
 So if you, like me, are a recovering coward, guess what?

229
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,260
 You're not disqualified from being used by God.

230
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,980
 Your greatest moments are just ahead of you.

231
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,940
 Be courageous.

232
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,540
 I want to unpack this a little bit deeper today by taking you into the scriptures and

233
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,260
 a story of one such recovering coward.

234
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
 His name's Joshua.

235
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,940
 And we're going to go to the most important segment of his story when God speaks those

236
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,020
 famous words for him to be strong and courageous.

237
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,340
 I want to unpack a little bit about the journey of Joshua to help you somewhat in your understanding

238
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,660
 and journey as well.

239
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,940
 Is this helpful for some people already?

240
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,940
 Yeah?

241
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,940
 All right.

242
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,500
 Joshua 1, starting in verse 1.

243
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,700
 After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua, son of Nun,

244
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,940
 Moses' aide, "Moses, my servant, is dead.

245
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,340
 Now then, you and all these people get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land that

246
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,100
 I am about to give them, to the Israelites.

247
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,460
 I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.

248
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,620
 Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon and from the great river to the

249
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,420
 Euphrates, all the Hittite country as well, to the great sea on the west.

250
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,700
 No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life.

251
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,820
 As I was with Moses, so I will be with you.

252
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,980
 I will never leave you, nor will I forsake you."

253
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,980
 Here it is.

254
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,980
 "Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land that

255
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,140
 I swore to their forefathers to give them."

256
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,300
 Be strong and very courageous.

257
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,300
 Be careful to obey all the law that my servant gave you.

258
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,060
 Do not turn from it from the right to the left, that you may be successful wherever

259
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,060
 you go.

260
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,660
 Do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth.

261
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,220
 Meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything that is written

262
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,220
 in it.

263
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,520
 Then you will be prosperous and successful.

264
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,460
 Have I not commanded you?

265
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,780
 Be strong and courageous.

266
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,260
 Do not be terrified.

267
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:42,100
 Do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go."

268
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,060
 This is a critical time in Israel's history.

269
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,900
 Moses has led Israel out of the slavery in Egypt and brought them all the way to the

270
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,860
 corner to the edge of the promised land.

271
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,660
 They're standing on one side of the river Jordan, and they can see the promised land

272
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,200
 just on the other side.

273
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,580
 But Moses knows he's not the one who's going to lead God's people into the promised land.

274
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,620
 It's a new leader, this young guy, Joshua, who will now take up that mantle of leadership

275
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,260
 and move them across the water.

276
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,300
 And this is the moment where it happens, and Joshua is a coward.

277
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,740
 He's terrified.

278
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,780
 He's so terrified that God needs to show up and say some very important things to him

279
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,220
 to get him the courage that he needs to be able to step forward in the thing that is

280
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,860
 his destiny.

281
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,480
 Now you've got to remember that it is Joshua himself who is writing these words.

282
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,740
 So as we read this, remember this is Joshua describing the events himself.

283
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,100
 Notice in verse one, he tells us so much about himself.

284
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,380
 He says, "After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua, 'Son

285
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,980
 of Nun, Moses' aid."

286
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,180
 The first thing he says is there's this death of Moses, and I want you to see how Joshua

287
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,700
 describes Moses.

288
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,500
 He says, "Servant of the Lord."

289
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,060
 Joshua could not have given Moses a more glorifying title than that.

290
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,140
 In the Old Testament, if you're going to speak powerfully of someone, honour them, look up

291
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,960
 to them, speak highly of them.

292
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,540
 If you were to say they are a servant of the Lord, that said everything.

293
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,060
 You're saying that basically God and this person are partners together.

294
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,900
 But by Joshua saying this, he's like saying Moses was the one.

295
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,100
 Moses led God's people.

296
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,100
 He was in intimate relationship with God.

297
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,220
 He saw face to face.

298
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,780
 He was the servant of the Lord.

299
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,040
 This guy was amazing.

300
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:30,420
 This is Joshua fanning in the flame how much he honours and glorifies and looks up to Moses

301
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,860
 as someone who had such a powerful relationship with God that he could change everything.

302
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,340
 And Joshua does not feel the same about himself.

303
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:47,020
 Here's the servant of the Lord, Moses, but Moses is now dead and the pressure is now

304
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
 on me.

305
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:54,980
 And you can sense that Joshua is overwhelmed with that pressure because transition is hard.

306
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,860
 I know that from personal experience because our previous senior pastors, John and Tony,

307
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,420
 who led this church incredibly handed over the church to me 10 years ago.

308
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,740
 And it came onto my shoulders to lead the church forward.

309
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,980
 Now thankfully they didn't die like Moses did.

310
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,980
 That's a really good thing.

311
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,820
 In fact, Tony's sitting right here right now.

312
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,140
 He's alive.

313
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,540
 So you didn't have to die for me to take over.

314
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,540
 That's a good thing.

315
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:26,380
 But, but in the same way that Joshua saw Moses said servant of the Lord, without being too

316
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,320
 much hyperbole, I looked at John and Tony as servants of the Lord.

317
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,780
 They were men that God had called to take a very small church of 20 people and grow

318
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,260
 it to the size that it was when I took it over.

319
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,980
 They'd done such phenomenal things.

320
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,860
 They'd led this church so faithfully.

321
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,580
 I looked up to them so deeply.

322
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,340
 They were my spiritual fathers.

323
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,140
 They still are my spiritual fathers.

324
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,620
 And they're like the servant of the Lord.

325
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,300
 And when I took on the vine, I felt just like Joshua.

326
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,220
 Who am I?

327
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,020
 I haven't done the things that they've done.

328
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,700
 I haven't achieved what they've achieved.

329
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,780
 I'm not even the same age that they are.

330
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,560
 I'm younger by like 20 years.

331
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
 What does it mean?

332
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,040
 Joshua, younger than Moses, having seen Moses do all this great stuff.

333
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:10,360
 And now he's standing in a place and he's like, who am I compared to this?

334
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,120
 Joshua's like, can I do it?

335
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,100
 I want you to notice something really important.

336
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,920
 Notice how Joshua labels himself.

337
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,900
 He says, Moses, the servant of the Lord.

338
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:24,740
 He said to me, Joshua, son of none, Moses is aid.

339
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,320
 He just said, Moses is the servant of the Lord.

340
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,680
 You wanna know who I am?

341
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,040
 I'm the servant of Moses.

342
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,900
 I'm his aid.

343
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
 I've been his assistant.

344
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,960
 When he's been doing all this great stuff with God

345
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,040
 and leading these people really well,

346
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,140
 man, I'm just the son of none and none did nothing.

347
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,980
 And I'm the assistant to the one who did it all.

348
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,060
 I'm just an aid.

349
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,580
 This is a powerful thing because Joshua doesn't see in himself

350
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,600
 what God is currently seeing in him.

351
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,340
 Joshua is in a place where the thing that he's gonna need courage for

352
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,220
 is to redefine who he actually is.

353
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,620
 And I want you to know this,

354
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,660
 the thing that you're always going to need courage for first in your life

355
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,560
 before you do anything else is the courage to redefine yourself

356
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,260
 in the way that God sees you.

357
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,500
 That is gonna take great courage in you.

358
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,620
 To really believe that you are the person that God says you are.

359
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,100
 To really embrace the idea that as a Christian holding the name of Christ,

360
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,580
 you are somebody who actually has something to say in this world.

361
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,780
 That despite your brokenness and your failures and your pains

362
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,180
 and the bad mistakes you've made

363
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,740
 and the sin that even still continues in your life,

364
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,540
 God looks down on you and says, "My son, my daughter,

365
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,240
 I see you, I love you, I'm for you.

366
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,860
 And through my son, Jesus,

367
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,480
 you can achieve all the things that I have designed and planned for you.

368
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,460
 And yet so often we're not defined by what God says,

369
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,620
 we're defined by what the world says.

370
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,820
 Or we're defined by what our fears say,

371
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,620
 we're defined by our failures,

372
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,140
 we're defined by our self-doubts.

373
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,740
 And here's Joshua having to go on a journey from saying,

374
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,620
 "Moses, a servant of the Lord,

375
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,080
 me the aid to Moses,

376
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,340
 to know me a servant of the Lord."

377
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,900
 Some of you in this room,

378
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,420
 the thing you need courage for right now in this time of your life

379
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,900
 is to make that journey as well.

380
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,260
 To make the journey from like, "Whoa, that person over there, man,

381
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,140
 they're awesome."

382
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,340
 To actually going, "No, I actually, we're the priesthood of all believers.

383
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,780
 Actually, I have the same authority Andrew has.

384
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,260
 Actually, I have the same gifting.

385
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,020
 I have the same spirit in me,

386
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,620
 that the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead

387
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,620
 is not just in a pastor, not just in a leader,

388
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,380
 not just in my small group community leader,

389
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,380
 it's actually in me as well."

390
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,260
 I need the courage to redefine myself in the way that God sees me.

391
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,820
 Some of you need to go on that journey

392
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,060
 because right now, here's how you're defining yourself.

393
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,860
 I'm fear's assistant.

394
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,580
 I'm the aid of self-doubt.

395
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,580
 Some of you are so caught in that space

396
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,420
 that it's not a wonder

397
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,220
 that you're not finding this courage rising up inside of you.

398
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,180
 Notice what God says in verse five here to Joshua,

399
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,780
 as he's trying to redefine himself.

400
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,460
 He says in verse five, he says,

401
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,060
 "No one will be able to stand against you

402
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,980
 all of the days of your life.

403
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,180
 As I was with Moses, so I will be with you."

404
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,780
 In other words, God has already redefined Joshua.

405
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,740
 He's already said, "Joshua, you're not Moses' aid anymore.

406
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,300
 You're not Moses' assistant.

407
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,860
 I look down on you and you are my servant.

408
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,300
 You are now the servant of the Lord.

409
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,460
 As I was with Moses, I'm gonna be with you.

410
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,700
 I'm gonna do the same things.

411
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,140
 I'm gonna give you the same authority.

412
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,940
 I'm gonna show you my glory, just like I showed him.

413
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,620
 There's a job ahead of you,

414
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,540
 which is even harder than the job that Moses was called to do

415
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,500
 but I'm with you.

416
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,420
 I'll be with you every step of the way.

417
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,820
 I've redefined you."

418
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,220
 Joshua now needed to redefine himself.

419
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,220
 The courage to redefine yourself

420
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,420
 is the greatest courage you will ever need.

421
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,060
 Well, let me ask you it this way.

422
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,540
 Who do you have the courage to become?

423
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,420
 Think about that.

424
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,460
 Who do you actually have the courage to become?

425
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,300
 And some of you in this room,

426
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,740
 the courage you have right now

427
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,540
 is limiting the person that you are to be.

428
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,940
 And there is no more important time

429
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,180
 in Hong Kong's history right now

430
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,380
 for us to rise up in the courage to become

431
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,380
 the church that this city needs,

432
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,100
 the courage to become the people our businesses need,

433
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,820
 the courage to become the teachers that our schools need,

434
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,620
 the courage to become the husbands that our wives need.

435
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,900
 Are you with me, church?

436
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,300
 The courage to begin to live in the way

437
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,180
 that we've been always called to live.

438
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,660
 So the great question is,

439
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,260
 where does this courage come from?

440
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,300
 How do I get it?

441
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,860
 Well, let me show you some things out of verse two and three.

442
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,340
 Moses, my servant is now dead.

443
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,740
 This is God speaking to Joshua.

444
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,220
 Now then, you and all these people

445
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,060
 get ready to cross the Jordan River

446
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,100
 into the land that I'm about to give them, the Israelites.

447
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,420
 I will give you every place where you set your foot

448
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,660
 as I promised Moses.

449
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,700
 I want you to see something really important here.

450
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,380
 See, God starts out by saying,

451
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,540
 okay, you wanna know where this courage comes from?

452
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:24,140
 He first of all talks to Joshua about his conditions.

453
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,220
 He says, you have some conditions

454
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,900
 and these conditions are pretty scary.

455
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,540
 So there's a reason why you're feeling fear.

456
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,380
 There's a reason why you're a bit of a coward right now

457
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,300
 because yeah, Moses is dead.

458
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,320
 See, God is not hiding the conditions

459
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,700
 that actually Joshua is facing.

460
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,860
 Moses is dead.

461
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,220
 I'm now asking you to carry this nation forward.

462
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
 And guess what?

463
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,260
 There's a lot of tough stuff ahead of you.

464
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,260
 There's Jericho right ahead of you,

465
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,060
 one of those most fortified cities.

466
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,500
 There are armies that are bigger than your army.

467
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,860
 What is ahead is really tough.

468
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,860
 So God is not hiding the reality of conditions,

469
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,220
 but here's what God is trying to teach Joshua.

470
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,540
 He's trying to say to Joshua,

471
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,540
 if in order for you to have courage,

472
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,020
 you have to separate courage from your conditions.

473
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,140
 You have to learn to separate those two things

474
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,380
 'cause here's the reality.

475
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,380
 If your courage is actually based on your conditions,

476
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,560
 more likely than not, you will be suffering with fear.

477
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,460
 You will be embracing your failures

478
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,340
 and you'll be filled with self-doubt

479
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,220
 and that's gonna take you towards cowardice

480
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,020
 because our conditions are tough.

481
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,220
 I mean, there's a tough future ahead for all of us.

482
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,460
 I mean, there are so many changes

483
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,740
 have happened in our city here.

484
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,940
 We are all still wondering

485
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,700
 what is the future gonna look like?

486
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,460
 There are challenges in all of our lives

487
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,300
 and if you're not facing any challenges right now,

488
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,480
 you will be facing challenges in the future.

489
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,260
 Life is tough and if our courage

490
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,780
 is connected to our conditions,

491
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,680
 we are more likely than not to make choices

492
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,060
 that will head us towards cowardice.

493
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,500
 If your trust is in your bank account

494
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,020
 and your bank account goes down,

495
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,860
 then you're gonna feel fear.

496
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,420
 If your courage is found in your relationships

497
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,060
 in your lives and those relationships begin to break down,

498
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,380
 you're probably gonna doubt yourself,

499
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,500
 you're gonna feel a failure,

500
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,060
 you're gonna make future decisions more towards cowardice.

501
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,900
 God is saying,

502
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,500
 "Stop connecting your courage with your conditions."

503
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,220
 Some of you in this room, that's a word in season for you

504
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,100
 because that's how you try to think of courage.

505
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,340
 You're connecting courage

506
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,060
 to what you think about your present and your future.

507
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,740
 When you do that, you will always be overwhelmed

508
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,300
 and God is saying to Joshua,

509
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,860
 "There's another way to live."

510
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,420
 I wanna show you what actually God says to Joshua

511
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,500
 over the nine verses.

512
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,820
 He says a bunch of different things,

513
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,260
 but let me give you a summary of it on a slide here.

514
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,740
 He says, "I will be with you.

515
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,020
 I'm gonna lead you.

516
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,380
 Know my word.

517
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,300
 I will do the same things for you I did Moses.

518
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,260
 Do not be afraid.

519
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,780
 I'm here with you, present with you.

520
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,500
 Don't turn from my law."

521
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,580
 Basically what God does is he unpacks all of the ways

522
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,780
 in which God is present with him

523
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,580
 and he says, "Don't look at your conditions.

524
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,780
 Look at me.

525
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,980
 Know my word.

526
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,140
 Know my presence.

527
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,260
 Know I'm with you.

528
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,660
 Know that my power is with you.

529
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,980
 I'm gonna treat you the same as I did Joshua."

530
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,100
 In other words, what God's doing to Joshua

531
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,300
 is trying to shift him from thinking about his conditions

532
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,780
 to actually beginning to think about convictions.

533
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,820
 And he's saying, "Are you convicted that I'm with you?

534
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,900
 Do you really believe that I'm here?

535
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,380
 Do you believe that I'm fighting battles for you?

536
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,100
 Do you truly believe that I'm gonna be present with you

537
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,940
 like Moses?

538
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,780
 'Cause if your courage,"

539
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,420
 I'm gonna use another pen colour here,

540
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,340
 "If your courage is actually linked to your convictions,

541
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,740
 then fear is not gonna overwhelm you.

542
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,020
 Your failures will not come to define you

543
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,980
 and your self-doubt will move to faith

544
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,900
 which will propel you to acts of courage.

545
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,740
 Our courage has to be founded not in conditions

546
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,060
 which lead us to cowardice,

547
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,780
 but in convictions which release us into better decisions

548
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,620
 which bring us into a courageous life."

549
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:11,340
 And God is saying over Joshua, "Be strong and courageous."

550
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,180
 I love this.

551
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,500
 He repeats it three times.

552
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,660
 And one time he says, "I command you."

553
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,820
 I don't know if you've ever thought about it that way.

554
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,780
 God commands Joshua to be courageous,

555
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,380
 which is really fascinating to me

556
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,180
 'cause what he doesn't say to Joshua

557
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,620
 is pray and ask for courage.

558
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,300
 He doesn't say, "Ask me for courage."

559
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,740
 He doesn't say, "Sit there and wait under a tree

560
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,580
 until one day I magically drop courage in you

561
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,460
 enough for you to live the life that I want you to live."

562
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,980
 He says, "I demand, I command you to find courage."

563
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,740
 And the question is, where do we find it?

564
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,380
 Well, we don't find it in our conditions

565
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,980
 which is what Joshua was doing.

566
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,660
 We find it in our convictions.

567
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,660
 And when we do so,

568
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,420
 we realise we already have everything we need for courage.

569
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,260
 Courage is not a spiritual gift.

570
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,300
 Never mentioned that way in Scripture.

571
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,220
 Courage is not one of the nine fruits of the Spirit.

572
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,060
 You know what courage is?

573
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,540
 Courage is within you already.

574
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,540
 That's why God can command it out of you.

575
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,500
 Be courageous.

576
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,300
 In other words, we don't ask God to give us courage.

577
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,420
 We realise that God has already done everything possible

578
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,420
 for us to have courage.

579
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,300
 You have Jesus and his life and his death

580
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,460
 and his resurrection.

581
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,420
 You have the one who has overcome death.

582
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,780
 You have the one who has now positioned himself

583
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
 over your life.

584
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,020
 You are now called his son and his daughter.

585
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,260
 You have everything inside of you already.

586
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,500
 The same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead

587
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,260
 is also now in you.

588
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,940
 You don't need to ask God for some additional power

589
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,620
 or miracle or a flow of his courage.

590
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,180
 And then I'll act courageous.

591
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,260
 God's saying, "Be strong and courageous

592
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,700
 'cause your convictions will drive you to a courageous life."

593
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,860
 If you wanna step up,

594
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,380
 if you wanna begin to act in the way

595
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,380
 that I've called you to be,

596
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,740
 I want it to come out of you.

597
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,180
 Believe Jesus really said what he said.

598
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,740
 Believe that he did what he did.

599
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,260
 Believe that he's in this world working right now.

600
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,260
 And when you align yourself to the conviction

601
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,020
 that Jesus is actually alive,

602
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,020
 that the Bible actually tells us the truth

603
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,260
 and we find courage rising up inside of us.

604
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,700
 And although our conditions might be difficult,

605
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,540
 they will not drive us to cowardice.

606
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,860
 We will propel ourselves to more courageous acts.

607
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,780
 So let me define courage for you

608
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,340
 in the way that I think God is speaking to it.

609
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,860
 Joshua, let me define it this way for you.

610
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:35,060
 Courage is a fervent and resolute strength within us

611
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,420
 that leads to positive action and change

612
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,180
 as a result of focusing on internal convictions

613
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,940
 over and above external conditions.

614
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,900
 That's where courage comes from.

615
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,260
 That's why God can command it into his people

616
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,220
 and command it out of his people.

617
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,740
 Have courage.

618
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,340
 And as I close, I'm gonna give you

619
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,500
 three practical ways this week

620
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,540
 you can put courage into practise.

621
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,580
 Is that good?

622
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,860
 Three practical things really fast.

623
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,900
 Here's the first one.

624
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,340
 Be prepared to be scared.

625
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,740
 I said it earlier, if your life doesn't scare you,

626
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,580
 get a new life.

627
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,180
 Be prepared to be scared.

628
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,020
 You're gonna have to face fear

629
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,060
 if you wanna live the life that Christ has called you to.

630
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,140
 I want you to live a life that demands courage.

631
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,980
 That means that there is gonna be fear.

632
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,660
 That you're gonna have to face some difficulties.

633
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,620
 It's gonna be difficult.

634
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,660
 If you're prepared to be scared,

635
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,380
 what it means is that when fear comes,

636
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,500
 it doesn't surprise you.

637
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,220
 It doesn't bowl you over.

638
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,660
 It might still be overwhelming.

639
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,060
 It might still be huge.

640
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,260
 But you're able to actually separate yourself

641
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,540
 a little bit from the fear,

642
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,700
 realising that the fear is not your identity.

643
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,060
 A fear is just a feeling often about certain conditions

644
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,300
 that are happening in your life.

645
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,900
 And you can somewhat put that to one side of you,

646
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,060
 look at it and say, I'm not defined by that fear,

647
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,620
 but that fear is a reminder to me to rise up in courage.

648
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,860
 So when we expect fear, we expose it,

649
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,900
 and then we can exit from it.

650
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,980
 Okay?

651
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,820
 Very easy, very simple.

652
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,340
 Be prepared to be scared.

653
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,620
 Here's the second thing, change your focus.

654
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,980
 Some of us in this room,

655
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,140
 our focus is predominantly on our conditions.

656
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,980
 And we're wondering why we don't live a life of courage.

657
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,940
 Some of you need to change your focus

658
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,060
 away from your conditions to your convictions.

659
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,260
 It doesn't mean we ignore our conditions.

660
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,260
 If there's a bill to pay, we need to pay our bills.

661
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,100
 Okay?

662
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,220
 I don't want you to go away and say,

663
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,020
 Andrew told me I could just forget all my conditions

664
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,220
 and just believe that God will provide.

665
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,500
 Okay, it doesn't quite work like that.

666
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,580
 Okay, conditions are important in life, right?

667
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,340
 What the teaching here, what God is saying to Joshua is,

668
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,740
 don't have your life founded on what your conditions

669
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,580
 are telling you.

670
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,900
 You need to focus more on your convictions.

671
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,660
 And when you do that, when you change your focus,

672
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,740
 you'll find courage coming.

673
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,980
 Some of you this week, just simply it is

674
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,620
 to recognize your conditions, not ignore them,

675
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,540
 be honest about them,

676
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,820
 just like God was honest about them with Joshua.

677
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,260
 But it is then to say, but God, I live by faith.

678
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,820
 And I choose to find my courage in who you are,

679
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,060
 not in what all of this is saying about who I am.

680
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,820
 Here's the final one, shift your what ifs.

681
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,660
 It's really interesting.

682
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,420
 When your courage is based on your conditions,

683
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,580
 you have lots of what ifs.

684
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,740
 Here are your what ifs.

685
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,820
 What if I fail?

686
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,940
 What if it doesn't work out?

687
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,660
 What if the person gives up on me?

688
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,780
 What if I don't get that promotion?

689
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,620
 What if I don't get that raise?

690
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,660
 What if I have that argument with that person?

691
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,580
 And we have all these negative what ifs

692
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,500
 when we focus on our conditions,

693
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,700
 but when we begin to think about our convictions,

694
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,260
 your what ifs change.

695
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,900
 And suddenly you're saying, what if God came through?

696
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,820
 What if the miracle did happen?

697
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,820
 What if the Bible was actually true?

698
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,060
 What if the same spirit that raised Christ in the jail

699
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,300
 was actually in me?

700
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,420
 And if that was really true, and I really believe that,

701
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,620
 what if I made decisions based on that?

702
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,740
 See, when we shift to convictions, our what ifs change,

703
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,980
 and we begin to speak more positive what ifs

704
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,180
 around our life, not what if I fail,

705
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,020
 but what if actually I succeed?

706
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,780
 On Sunday, the 3rd of November, 2013,

707
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,500
 it was the first Sunday I was senior pastor here at the Vine.

708
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,740
 The Sunday before, John and Tony had handed over to me

709
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,340
 in a lavish ceremony here at the Vine.

710
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,660
 It was very lovely.

711
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,380
 But the next Sunday, here I was, and I was terrified.

712
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,180
 My first Sunday as the senior leader here,

713
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,180
 standing right here at the front of my wife, Christine,

714
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,980
 during worship time, and everybody, "Worship!"

715
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,380
 Me going, (mimics drumming)

716
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,700
 because I hadn't redefined myself as a servant of the Lord.

717
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,540
 I was still just the assistant to John and Tony.

718
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,980
 And right there in the worship time,

719
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,500
 one of our elders, Blair Donaldson,

720
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,620
 no one was looking, no one was watching.

721
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,260
 He came over, he put his hands on my shoulders,

722
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,420
 and he looked me in the eyes,

723
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,820
 and he said, "Be strong and courageous."

724
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,260
 And so I stand before you today as a recovering coward,

725
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,340
 way more courageous today than I was back then.

726
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,900
 And I stand over you, and I put my hands on your shoulders,

727
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,300
 and I say, "Be strong and courageous,"

728
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,500
 because your city needs it, you need it,

729
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,300
 your families need it, your workplaces need it.

730
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,460
 Do not live a life of cowardice.

731
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,780
 Embrace the convictions of your faith,

732
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,300
 and rise up in courage.

733
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,460
 Be strong and courageous.

734
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,420
 Can I pray for you guys?

735
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,260
 Let's pray.

736
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,540
 (congregation applauding)

737
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,420
 I want you to stand with me, and we're gonna pray.

738
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,920
 We're gonna pray.

739
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:44,060
 Father, I am deeply privileged

740
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,420
 to be in a room with these people,

741
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,660
 and those that are watching online right now.

742
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,180
 Lord, what a privilege it is for us

743
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,100
 to stand in this moment before you.

744
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,060
 And Lord, every single person here has a different story.

745
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,140
 Every person has a different thing going on in their lives,

746
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,780
 a different thing that they're gonna need courage for.

747
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,820
 Father, I thank you that here at The Vine,

748
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,340
 we're committed to living the best life possible,

749
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,700
 a life of flourishing.

750
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,220
 But Lord, I think the honest confession

751
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,380
 of many of our hearts today would be,

752
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,180
 more often than not,

753
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:23,660
 or maybe another way to say it, too often, Lord,

754
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,580
 I know that I make weak decisions,

755
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,700
 weak decisions based on my fears,

756
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,380
 based on my failures,

757
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,660
 weak decisions that are based on my self-doubt,

758
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,260
 that are all founded in the conditions around me

759
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:43,740
 that lead me to being a coward for you

760
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,460
 in a time when I need to be courageous.

761
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:53,260
 The Lord has already poured out

762
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,700
 absolutely everything you'll ever need

763
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,460
 for the courage that you need to live the life

764
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,900
 that He's called you to live.

765
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,700
 So as you stand before Him today,

766
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:11,420
 know that He is here for you in whatever area you need.

767
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,580
 Some of you in this room, it's in fear.

768
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,700
 You know that fear is largely defining

769
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,180
 a lot of the decisions you're making right now.

770
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,940
 I think that's particularly for some of you here

771
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,100
 about your future.

772
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,020
 You're allowing fear to define the decisions

773
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,340
 you're making about your future,

774
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,220
 and you're making weak decisions about your future

775
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,140
 based on fear.

776
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:36,740
 The Lord wants to release that from you today

777
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,260
 and give you the courage to make better decisions.

778
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:45,260
 Some of you here, you've been so wracked by guilt

779
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,540
 because of past mistakes you've made.

780
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,700
 You know, it's interesting, God calls Moses

781
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,740
 to go back to Egypt because God wanted Moses

782
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,820
 to face his fears and his mistakes

783
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,220
 before he could truly lead God's people to the promised land.

784
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,060
 Some of you need to go back and face some of the mistakes.

785
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,860
 And the greatest amount of courage you're gonna need

786
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,100
 is to do that.

787
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,380
 And I believe that the Holy Spirit

788
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,080
 wants to release you today.

789
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:20,420
 Courage is not having all the right answers.

790
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,340
 Courage is being willing to ask the questions

791
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,060
 that you've been putting off for a long time.

792
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,260
 Some of you in this room need to ask

793
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,660
 and face some of those questions

794
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,380
 that you've been putting off a long time.

795
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,860
 And I believe that the Lord is gonna give you courage

796
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,760
 to do that as you find yourself in his convictions.

797
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,140
 Some of you in this room need to redefine yourself.

798
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:54,460
 You still see yourself as this person's aid

799
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,540
 or this person's assistant.

800
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,260
 Maybe you're in an environment in your office

801
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,700
 where there's people better than you.

802
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,460
 And that's a reality for all of us.

803
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,900
 Somebody once told me that if I'm the smartest in the room,

804
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,140
 I should find a new room.

805
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,620
 We're always gonna be surrounded hopefully

806
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,740
 by people who are better, smarter,

807
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,220
 maybe more accomplished than we are.

808
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,520
 Do not allow their accomplishments to define yours.

809
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,380
 Some of you in this room need to realize

810
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,420
 that actually you're far more gifted than you thought.

811
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,520
 That actually God's got a role for you.

812
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,480
 That God's got something that he wants to say to you.

813
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,720
 And he wants you to rise up to make courageous decisions,

814
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,160
 not decisions out of cowardice

815
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,960
 because you're comparing yourself to someone else,

816
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,720
 but decisions out of your convictions

817
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,560
 that will propel you forward into the future

818
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,320
 that God has prepared for you.

819
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,280
 Father, whatever it might be for whoever it is in this room,

820
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,760
 church, this is an important moment.

821
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,800
 Take the time right now.

822
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,000
 Just invite the Holy Spirit to whatever area it is

823
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,200
 that you're looking for.

824
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,560
 And like I said before,

825
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,560
 this is not about God coming and anointing you with courage.

826
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,720
 This is about you doing your work led by the Spirit

827
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,800
 to find that courage within you.

828
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,880
 Courage is a decision.

829
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,920
 It's a choice.

830
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,160
 May you, based on the convictions of your faith,

831
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,920
 make better choices.

832
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,760
 Allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you

833
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,560
 as we now minister together in worship.

834
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,480
 (thunder rumbling)
