1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
 Today I wanna speak about reconciliation.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,520
 In simple terms, reconciliation is the process

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,520
 of making two people or groups of people friendly again

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,440
 after they've argued seriously or fought

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,120
 and kept apart from each other.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,560
 But first, let me tell you about Mary Johnson.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,360
 Mary lost her son in 1993 after a then-teenaged O'Shea Israel

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,440
 go into a fight with him at a party in Minneapolis,

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,460
 and he shot him.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,100
 With so many questions unanswered,

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,600
 Mary Johnson went to visit O'Shea in jail.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,880
 After her first contact, she said this,

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,840
 "I began to feel this movement in my feet.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 "It moved up my legs.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,640
 "It just moved up my body.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,140
 "When I felt it leave me, I instantly knew

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,040
 "that all hatred and anger and animosity

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,860
 "I had in my heart for you for 12 years was over.

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,640
 "I have totally forgiven you."

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:27,280
 Unbelievably, the two went on to live as neighbors

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,520
 in the same duplex, and Johnson even referred to Israel

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,240
 as her son in interviews.

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,840
 We have a picture of them here.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,480
 Israel told Mary Johnson, "I admire you

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,580
 "for being brave enough to offer forgiveness

26
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,640
 "and for being brave enough to take that step.

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,100
 "It motivates me to make sure

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,340
 "that I stay on the right path."

29
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,320
 Last year, Mary passed away,

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,340
 and Israel served as a pallbearer at her funeral.

31
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,700
 Reconciliation.

32
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,340
 This morning, we come to Genesis 44

33
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,860
 as we continue through our story, the study of Joseph.

34
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,340
 Not only does the story of Joseph tell us

35
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,240
 how Israel wound up in Egypt,

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,620
 not only does it tell us how God made this family of Jacob

37
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,860
 into a great nation in accordance with his promises

38
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,780
 to Abraham in Genesis 12, 15, and 17,

39
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,100
 but God also shows us something

40
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,880
 of his strategy in redemption.

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,460
 Redemption with his people to bring blessing

42
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,940
 where there is alienation,

43
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,620
 to bring reconciliation where there is intense hostility.

44
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,280
 Our series has focused on the life of Joseph.

45
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,560
 Joseph began life, as we heard, as a favored son,

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,080
 and in the very context of that rivalry with his brothers,

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,080
 experienced the great humiliation of his life.

48
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,360
 He is sold into slavery.

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,220
 He serves well as a servant in the house of Potiphar.

50
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,900
 He finds himself falsely accused

51
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,360
 and imprisoned in a royal prison.

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,380
 He is finally released,

53
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,180
 and he is made the second-ranking official

54
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,460
 behind Pharaoh, his prime minister.

55
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:43,660
 But just as he has, with his own mouth and heart,

56
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,060
 uttered these words, look at these.

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,240
 God has made me forget my trouble

58
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,840
 and all my father's household.

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,000
 Just as he said that,

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,400
 the Lord brings his father's household

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,120
 right into his backyard

62
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,460
 and begins to do a work that not even Joseph could imagine.

63
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,360
 And so, as I say, we come now to Genesis 44,

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,780
 as Joseph's test reaches its great culmination.

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,620
 You remember last week's sermon from Justin.

66
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,020
 Joseph's family had been brought to Egypt

67
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,220
 because of the famine.

68
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,800
 He had kindly given them grain,

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,720
 though he had kept Simeon.

70
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,360
 They had been accused of being spies,

71
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,160
 and as an assurance they would return, Simeon was kept.

72
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,840
 And indeed, they did return as they promised,

73
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,820
 bringing their youngest brother, Benjamin,

74
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,720
 even though it took a great deal

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,800
 of persuading of Jacob, their father.

76
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,880
 But they did return with Benjamin,

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,800
 and again, they were treated greatly.

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,840
 They were feasted royally.

79
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,040
 They were treated kindly by Joseph.

80
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,060
 They brought into his own household.

81
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,800
 They separated with him.

82
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,040
 And now in this passage,

83
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,100
 they are preparing to depart.

84
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,940
 Let's read it.

85
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:24,000
 But Joseph has one more test to bring to bear

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,080
 on his brothers.

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,680
 Now Joseph gave these instructions

88
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,040
 to the steward of his house.

89
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,400
 Fill the man's sacks with as much food as they can carry,

90
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,540
 and put each man's silver in the mouth of his sack.

91
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,500
 Then, then put my cup, the silver one,

92
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,920
 in the mouth of the youngest one's sack,

93
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,420
 along with the silver for his grain.

94
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,560
 And he did as Joseph said.

95
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,100
 As the morning dawned, the men were sent out on their way

96
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
 with their donkeys.

97
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,980
 They had not gone far from the city

98
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,140
 when Joseph said to his steward,

99
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,060
 "Go after them men at once.

100
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,380
 "And when you catch up with them, say to them,

101
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,640
 "why have you repaid good with evil?

102
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,440
 "Isn't this the cup my master drinks from

103
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,260
 "and also uses for divination?

104
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,460
 "This is a wicked thing you have done."

105
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,980
 When he caught up with them,

106
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,840
 he repeated these words to him.

107
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,380
 But they said to him, "Why does my Lord say these things?

108
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,720
 "Far be it from your servants to do anything like that.

109
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,460
 "We even brought back to you from the land of Cain

110
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,640
 "and the silver we found inside the mouth of your sacks.

111
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,240
 "So why would we steal silver or gold

112
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,620
 "from your master's house?

113
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,620
 "If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die.

114
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,000
 "And the rest of us will become the Lord's slave."

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,260
 Now what we're gonna see is this.

116
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,980
 We will see that for reconciliation to take place,

117
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,960
 it involved three steps.

118
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,140
 And the first one is this.

119
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,340
 It involved a conspiracy, a conspiracy.

120
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,420
 Joseph and his brothers

121
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,940
 had just enjoyed a time of celebration.

122
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,740
 The brothers still do not know who Joseph is.

123
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,700
 But he's dropping hints there and then.

124
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,820
 For example, when he seats the brothers

125
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,600
 in chapter 43 at the table,

126
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,620
 they are, we are told,

127
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,520
 astonishingly seated in birth order.

128
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,300
 And we read that Benjamin, Joseph's only full brother,

129
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,540
 is given five times,

130
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,580
 five times as much as the rest of the brothers

131
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,060
 during the meal.

132
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,100
 All you can eat.

133
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,900
 Now the meal is over and the next day has dawned.

134
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,420
 The brothers are feeling pretty good about things.

135
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,440
 They've convinced the prime minister of Egypt

136
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,140
 that they're not spies.

137
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,340
 They have rescued their brother, Simeon, from prison.

138
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,020
 They are about to return home

139
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,340
 with more grain for the family, all their money,

140
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,140
 and most importantly,

141
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,380
 they are returning home with Benjamin,

142
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,720
 just as Judah had promised his father.

143
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,780
 So the morning dawns

144
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,540
 and the men take their grain and their animals

145
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,240
 and they set out towards home.

146
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,180
 No doubt, they are filled with excitement

147
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,260
 at going home to their families and children.

148
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,540
 No doubt, they are congratulating themselves

149
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,500
 on their successful mission to Egypt.

150
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,980
 But what they don't know

151
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,380
 is that God is working behind the scenes

152
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,900
 to bring them face to face with a sin.

153
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:54,560
 A sin some 22 years old.

154
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,140
 While the men are preparing to leave,

155
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,700
 Joseph tells the steward of his house

156
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,860
 to prepare the grain they need.

157
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,860
 His order is to give them as much as they can carry.

158
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,380
 In verse one, he tells the steward

159
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,180
 to give them their money back also.

160
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,820
 Then Joseph tells his steward to do something very strange.

161
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,040
 We see in verse two, he tells the man

162
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,180
 to take his personal cup

163
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,640
 and place it in the sack that belongs to Benjamin.

164
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,500
 This is done and the men set out towards home.

165
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,220
 When they've been gone a while,

166
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,940
 Joseph sets the steward after them to stop them

167
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,000
 and to confront them about the cup in Benjamin's sack.

168
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,340
 The steward follows them and accuses them

169
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,380
 of rewarding evil for good.

170
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,740
 We read earlier, he accuses them

171
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,300
 of stealing Joseph's silver cup, that's verse six.

172
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,020
 In verse seven, the brothers deny the charge

173
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,120
 and seek to defend their honour.

174
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,100
 They remind the steward that they have plenty of money.

175
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,700
 It isn't likely they would steal a cup.

176
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,740
 And in verse eight, they are so sure of their innocence,

177
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,620
 they make such strong promises.

178
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,900
 They swear in verse nine, that if the cup is found

179
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,740
 among them, the guilty brother will die

180
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,700
 and the rest will become slaves to the Egyptians.

181
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,200
 Think about this for a moment.

182
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,420
 This is a very strange way for Joseph

183
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,000
 to treat his brothers.

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,060
 A very strange way for Joseph to treat his brothers.

185
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,900
 In this passage, God uses Joseph as an instrument

186
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:05,100
 to draw these men to a place of repentance and restoration.

187
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,780
 We saw, do you remember in week two, long time ago,

188
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,580
 22 years before, that these men had conspired,

189
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,580
 Genesis 37, against Joseph in an effort to get rid of him.

190
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,700
 They had conspired to Joseph's harm.

191
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,780
 Now the tables are turned and Joseph conspires against them.

192
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:39,200
 But unlike his brothers, he is not conspiring

193
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,380
 in an effort to harm them.

194
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,440
 He is conspiring for their good.

195
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,440
 Now, we need to remember there are no accidents in life.

196
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,280
 If you're a child of God, every event of your life,

197
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,720
 according to Romans 8, 28, is a product of divine providence

198
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,560
 that God is working out.

199
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,680
 Isaiah 55 describes his will in your life

200
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,340
 in ways that you and I cannot begin to comprehend.

201
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,960
 And this even includes the way that God deals with our sins.

202
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,800
 There are times when we allow,

203
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,060
 we allow sin to abide in our lives.

204
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,000
 After a while, we could get so used to sin's presence

205
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,700
 to the point where it no longer bothers us.

206
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,180
 Or we may come away thinking, ah, we got away with it,

207
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,480
 with some sin or other.

208
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,400
 Because we've not faced judgment

209
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,480
 or chastisement over that sin.

210
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,840
 The fact is, God knows exactly when and how

211
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,880
 to speak to our hearts.

212
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,360
 When the time is right,

213
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,440
 He will touch all the right buttons to humble us

214
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,740
 and bring us to a place of repentance.

215
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,560
 God knows how to get our attention.

216
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,800
 And He is not afraid to touch or take

217
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,920
 what He pleases to speak to our hearts.

218
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,700
 He has a silver cup, a silver cup,

219
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,000
 that He can place in our lives to open our eyes

220
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,700
 when we have walked away from Him.

221
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,020
 My friends, sooner or later,

222
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:36,480
 the silver cup will end up in your sack.

223
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,640
 And I'll say it again.

224
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,760
 Sooner or later, the silver cup will end up in your sack.

225
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:53,420
 We've come to believe we can get away with sin.

226
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,420
 Like Adam and Eve, we think we can cover it up

227
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,760
 with flimsy fig leaves of our own making.

228
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,760
 God, however, will settle for nothing less

229
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,440
 than total confession and repentance.

230
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,280
 And the best thing a believer can do

231
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,280
 is to get sin out into the open as soon as possible.

232
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,720
 The best thing we can do with sin,

233
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,740
 according to 1 John 1:9,

234
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:29,120
 is to hate it, forsake it, and confess it to Him.

235
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,800
 When we refuse, there will be a high price

236
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,720
 to pay for our disobedience.

237
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,080
 We may not understand it all,

238
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,580
 but this is what is happening in these verses.

239
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,960
 God is in the process of burning the barley fields

240
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,820
 of these brothers of Joseph.

241
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,860
 God is in the process of getting their attention.

242
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,600
 He is conspiring to bring them back to Him.

243
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,300
 So yes, it involved a conspiracy.

244
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,200
 But secondly, it also involved a confrontation.

245
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,020
 Verse 10.

246
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,160
 Very well then, he said, let it be as you say.

247
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,680
 Whoever is found to have it will become my slave.

248
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,080
 The rest of you will be free from blame.

249
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,160
 Each of them quickly lowered his sack

250
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,960
 to the ground and opened it.

251
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,640
 Then the steward proceeded to search,

252
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,900
 beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest.

253
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,400
 And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

254
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,320
 The cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

255
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,960
 At this, they tore their clothes,

256
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,480
 then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.

257
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,440
 The sacks were opened and searched.

258
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,520
 These brothers knew they'd done nothing wrong.

259
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,000
 Can you see them standing there

260
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,160
 with smug expressions on their faces?

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,920
 As each sack is opened and the silver cup is not found,

262
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,620
 they grow more and more confident.

263
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,060
 But when they open Benjamin's sack,

264
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,060
 to their disbelief, their glistening in Benjamin's sack

265
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,000
 is Joseph's silver cup.

266
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,880
 This is the moment of truth.

267
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,000
 This is Joseph's final test of his brothers.

268
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,360
 All this time, Joseph has been testing them

269
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,800
 to see whether or not they've changed.

270
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,660
 Now note, they've passed several tests already.

271
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,720
 They brought Benjamin back, as Joseph has requested.

272
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,640
 They returned for their brother, Simeon.

273
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,320
 They even returned all the grain money

274
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,300
 they had been given back.

275
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,860
 This is the ultimate test.

276
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,960
 22 years earlier, they had hated Joseph so much

277
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,680
 that they attacked him, cast him in a pit,

278
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,280
 and sold him into slavery.

279
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,880
 They had broken their father's heart

280
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,280
 by lying to him about what happened to Joseph.

281
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,200
 They had maintained that lie for all these years.

282
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,640
 And now, they have the opportunity

283
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,960
 to get rid of the other son of Rachel.

284
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,880
 It is clear from the text that Jacob loves Benjamin.

285
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,000
 It seems clear that Benjamin had replaced Joseph

286
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,800
 as the father's favorite son.

287
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,980
 But all they have to do is this,

288
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,980
 allow Benjamin to be arrested, take him back to Joseph.

289
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,480
 They can simply go home.

290
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,360
 It would obviously break the heart of their father,

291
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,360
 but he'd enjoyed other heartbreaks in the past.

292
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,640
 This is the ultimate test.

293
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,080
 These men do not know it,

294
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,800
 but they are about to reveal to Joseph

295
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,280
 what kind of men they have become.

296
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:20,400
 And these men passed the test with flying colors.

297
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,200
 They do not know how the cup got into Benjamin's sack.

298
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,720
 At that point, that particular fact doesn't even matter,

299
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,000
 but they are determined to face whatever comes together.

300
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,080
 They tear their clothes off as a sign of grief,

301
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,560
 and they go to face the music as one.

302
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,840
 There are no accusations thrown at each other.

303
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,320
 There are no compromises.

304
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,460
 There is simply a unified resolve to stand by their brother.

305
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,040
 What we see here is a picture of 10 men

306
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,960
 who are finally ready to do the right thing.

307
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,320
 Here are 10 men who have finally grown up

308
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,280
 and are willing to face whatever consequences

309
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,220
 they are together.

310
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,400
 These men have grown to the point

311
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,080
 when they can see beyond themselves.

312
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,520
 They have a desire to do right

313
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,600
 regardless of the personal cost.

314
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,440
 My friends, that is the place

315
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,720
 that God wants us to reach as well.

316
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,640
 He wants us to come to the place

317
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,560
 where we stop making excuses for our behavior.

318
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,400
 He wants us to come to the place

319
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,280
 where we are willing to own up to our sins.

320
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,080
 God wants us to stop pointing the finger at others.

321
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,720
 My sins are not my parents' fault.

322
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,180
 I can't blame my evil on my wife or my surroundings.

323
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,480
 If I'm gonna enjoy cleansing and forgiveness,

324
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,760
 I have to deal with my sins openly and honestly.

325
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,320
 If I'm gonna have the power of God on my life,

326
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,020
 then I have to do the right thing.

327
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,320
 God wants us to reach the place

328
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,280
 where we are willing to do the right thing

329
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,940
 regardless of personal cost.

330
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400
 Have you reached that place?

331
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,840
 Have I reached that place?

332
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,900
 We can with His help.

333
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,160
 I don't know about you, but I wanna get there.

334
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,080
 God is not afraid to confront us

335
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,960
 at the very point of our sins

336
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,220
 in order to open our eyes to a need for repentance.

337
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,880
 These brothers are facing the things they are facing

338
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,480
 because God is determined to get their attention

339
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,080
 and bring them back into a right relationship with Him.

340
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,380
 He will do the same in your life and mine.

341
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:03,900
 The best thing we can do with God is to keep short accounts.

342
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,120
 Sin should be confessed immediately,

343
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,500
 completely, and honestly.

344
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,800
 When it is, it can be forgiven.

345
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,160
 And the blessings of God can freely flow into our lives.

346
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,460
 And this introduces our third step.

347
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,800
 Yes, it involves a conspiracy.

348
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,920
 Secondly, it involves a confrontation.

349
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,620
 But thirdly, it involves a confession.

350
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,480
 When the brothers arrived back at Joseph's palace,

351
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,600
 they still find him there.

352
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,340
 Verse 14, Joseph was still in the house

353
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,400
 when Judah and the brothers came in

354
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,500
 and they threw themselves to the ground before him.

355
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,300
 And no doubt, Joseph was waiting to see who would show up.

356
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,760
 Would it be Benjamin alone?

357
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,320
 Or would the rest of the brothers be with him?

358
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,160
 By the way, this little trick may have been Joseph's way

359
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,200
 of protecting Benjamin from his brothers.

360
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,480
 When the brothers appear before Joseph,

361
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,360
 they bow themselves to the ground before him.

362
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,080
 And just like last week, this fulfills the dreams

363
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,160
 that Joseph had as a young man.

364
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,660
 Go to Genesis 37, five to 11.

365
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:27,760
 Joseph confronts his brothers about the silver cup.

366
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,720
 At this point, Judah steps forward

367
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,980
 and delivers one of the most profound

368
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,960
 and eloquent speeches in the whole Bible.

369
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,120
 A careful examination of this speech

370
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,640
 will show just how far Judah has matured.

371
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,920
 In verse 16, Judah confesses their sin.

372
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,340
 What can we say to my Lord?

373
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,040
 What can we say?

374
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,060
 How can we prove our innocence?

375
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,080
 God has uncovered your servant's guilt.

376
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
 We are now, my Lord, slaves.

377
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,880
 We ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup.

378
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,520
 He doesn't name names.

379
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,080
 But he does confess the fact that they had sin

380
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,040
 and God was punishing them for their sin.

381
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,680
 He seemed to believe that what they are about to face,

382
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,760
 slavery in Egypt, is a direct result

383
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,300
 of their unconfessed sin.

384
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,440
 He offers himself along with all the rest of the brothers

385
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,360
 as Joseph's servants.

386
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,440
 In verse 17, we see that Joseph refuses Judah's offer

387
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,000
 and tells him and the rest of the brothers to go home.

388
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,240
 He tells him that Benjamin,

389
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,480
 Benjamin will have to stay as a slave.

390
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,120
 The verses 18 to 34, we don't have time to go through them,

391
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,640
 are the heart of Judah's speech.

392
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,280
 He reminds Joseph that the only reason Benjamin had come

393
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,400
 was because Joseph had demanded it.

394
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,880
 Judah then tells Joseph that Jacob will die

395
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
 if anything happens to his youngest son.

396
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,720
 Next, and this is important,

397
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,820
 Judah offers himself in Benjamin's place.

398
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,200
 He offers to stay in Egypt as Joseph's slave

399
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,480
 so that Benjamin can return to Canaan

400
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,520
 with the other brothers.

401
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,880
 This is the moment,

402
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,800
 this is the moment that Joseph has been waiting for.

403
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,560
 He's been waiting and working

404
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,080
 since his brothers showed up in Egypt.

405
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,240
 He sees that they have changed.

406
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,160
 He sees that the brothers are willing

407
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,560
 to stand together as one man.

408
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,120
 They had the chance to turn their backs on Benjamin,

409
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
 but they didn't.

410
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,120
 Judah stands up and puts his father, Benjamin,

411
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,980
 and the rest of the brothers ahead of himself.

412
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,680
 It's interesting, isn't it?

413
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,560
 That the guilty offers himself

414
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,680
 as a substitute for the innocent.

415
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,520
 But there will be another lion of the tribe of Judah

416
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,280
 who is innocent,

417
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:13,680
 who would offer himself as a substitute for the guilty.

418
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:20,200
 And his name is Jesus.

419
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,480
 This is a major turning point in the story.

420
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,320
 When Joseph hears Judah's confession

421
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,320
 and sees his love for the family in action,

422
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,860
 it's more than he can stand.

423
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,920
 Joseph breaks down before his brothers

424
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
 and reveals his identity to them.

425
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,360
 We read,

426
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,320
 Joseph made himself known to his brothers.

427
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,200
 Today, there is a lesson that we need to take to heart.

428
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,480
 Judah shows us how sin is to be handled.

429
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,920
 His actions also remind us of the very nature of sin.

430
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,640
 Let's consider those two thoughts before we close today.

431
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,520
 Firstly, sin by its very nature is a very selfish thing.

432
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,240
 When sin entered the world,

433
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,280
 it entered because Eve was selfish.

434
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,900
 She chose herself over the Lord, Genesis 3.

435
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,440
 When sin entered the universe,

436
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,200
 it entered through selfishness.

437
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,200
 Every sin that we commit is rooted in selfishness.

438
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,880
 Secondly, our sins are all about us.

439
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,080
 When we choose ourselves over every other person

440
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,400
 and over every other thing, we are saying,

441
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,400
 I want what I want and I do not care about the consequences.

442
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,040
 I repeat, sin is a very selfish act.

443
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,920
 When we sin, we are choosing ourselves over God,

444
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,160
 over His will, over the church, over our families,

445
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,640
 over everything but our own selfish wants,

446
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,280
 desires and wishes.

447
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,100
 Sin is rooted in selfishness.

448
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,640
 But when our hearts are as they should be,

449
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,600
 the Lord, His will and the needs of others

450
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,040
 will come before our own desires.

451
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,400
 You know you're making progress in the Lord

452
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,900
 when you refuse to sin

453
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,080
 because of how it will affect the Lord's work

454
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,920
 and how it will affect others.

455
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:41,000
 I'll be honest with you, most people turn away from sin

456
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,960
 because they're afraid of being caught.

457
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,200
 But a mature believer looks at sin

458
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,960
 and sees the damage it can do to the church,

459
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,040
 the community, the Lord's work, the family and others.

460
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:59,020
 The only way to get past sin is to deal with it honestly.

461
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,300
 Like Judah, we have to come to the place

462
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,760
 where we confess our sins and get them out before the Lord

463
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,040
 and before those we have sinned against.

464
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,360
 Sin must not be hidden.

465
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,320
 It must be confessed openly and early.

466
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,360
 When it is, the Lord can extend forgiveness

467
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,720
 and restoration.

468
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,480
 The sin can be put behind you

469
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,440
 and you can move on in the Lord.

470
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,560
 All my friends, if Joseph in this scheme

471
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,160
 knew how to search out the hearts of his brothers,

472
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,900
 how much more does God know how to search our hearts?

473
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,120
 In 3 John verse four, John says this,

474
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,760
 "I have no greater joy than to hear

475
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,160
 that my children walk in truth."

476
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,200
 John was saying that his greatest joy as a preacher

477
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,840
 and an apostle was to see the people he ministered to

478
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,360
 growing and walking in the truth he had taught them.

479
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,720
 I know how he feels.

480
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,520
 That's the same feeling that must have gripped

481
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,280
 the heart of Joseph as he looked at Judah,

482
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,820
 saw his broken heart and heard his heartfelt words.

483
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,860
 The brothers of Joseph had finally grown up.

484
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,740
 And they were ready to make things right.

485
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,920
 And the importance of this, my friends, is this.

486
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,860
 There can be no reconciliation without repentance.

487
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,100
 Can I say that again?

488
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:36,980
 There can be no reconciliation without repentance.

489
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:43,100
 As I bring these thoughts to a close today,

490
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,740
 let me ask you a couple of questions.

491
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,140
 First one of this, are you growing in the Lord?

492
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,940
 How would you know?

493
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,620
 You can know that you are growing in your relationship

494
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,660
 with the Lord when you begin to hate sin.

495
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,820
 You know you are growing when you are willing

496
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,900
 to tell the truth about your sins.

497
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,220
 You know you are growing when you reach the place

498
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,320
 where you are more concerned about others

499
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,780
 than you are about yourself.

500
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,380
 Second question, are there sins in your life

501
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,920
 that need to be confessed?

502
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,500
 Maybe you need to get before the Lord today

503
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 and deal with some sin in your life.

504
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,260
 Maybe you need to go to someone you've hurt

505
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,940
 and confess that hurt to them.

506
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,100
 Things will never be as they could until you do.

507
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:40,060
 And lastly, are you afraid

508
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,980
 there might be a silver cup in your future?

509
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,420
 If you know there are areas of your life

510
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,340
 that are not where you need to be with the Lord

511
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,260
 and you fear that he might resort to drastic measures

512
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,420
 to get your attention, you need to come to him

513
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,240
 and deal with the matter now.

514
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,800
 Do you know that if sin is on your mind today,

515
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,560
 it's the Holy Spirit calling you to come to God

516
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,580
 to deal with the matter.

517
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,060
 In my opinion, it is far better to come before the Lord

518
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,060
 in humble repentance than it is to wait for him

519
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,800
 to burn your barley fields.

520
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:27,240
 If the Lord has spoken to your heart on any level,

521
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,060
 you need to come to him today

522
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:35,120
 and do what he is telling you to do.

523
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:42,080
 You do what he would have you to do.

524
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,840
 As I ask the band to come back,

525
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,040
 we're now gonna have an act of reconciliation.

526
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,440
 So could the band come back?

527
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:58,160
 If there's anyone here today who has no sin,

528
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,860
 you better come to the front and pray for the rest of us.

529
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,440
 I believe this is a hard word for us,

530
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,360
 but there's an answer.

531
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,960
 We need to come before God.

532
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:21,920
 I'm gonna ask you if you're able to kneel.

533
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,040
 If you're not able to kneel, just to sit,

534
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,180
 but I want you to take this seriously.

535
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,760
 We're gonna have an act of reconciliation together

536
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,680
 before God.

537
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,100
 (soft music)

538
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:42,840
 If I can get down at 72, you can all get down.

539
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,920
 The Holy Spirit is gonna do something here now.

540
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:54,280
 And to help me, I'm gonna use some words

541
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,080
 from the book of common prayer.

542
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,560
 These are the words I was just referring to earlier

543
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,640
 from 1 John 1, 8 and 9.

544
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,640
 "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves

545
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,780
 "and the truth is not in us.

546
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:22,700
 "But if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just

547
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:29,380
 "to forgive us our sins and cleanse us

548
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,280
 "from all unrighteousness."

549
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,400
 Holy Spirit come.

550
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,560
 Holy Spirit come.

551
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,000
 Holy Spirit come.

552
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,420
 (soft music)

553
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,280
 Almighty God, our heavenly Father,

554
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,060
 we have sinned against you and against our fellow men

555
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,060
 in thought and word and deed.

556
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,120
 Through negligence, through weakness,

557
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,800
 through our own deliberate fault.

558
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:04,280
 We are truly sorry and repent of all our sins

559
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,720
 for the sake of your Son, Jesus Christ, who died for us.

560
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,200
 Forgive us all that is past.

561
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,940
 I grant that we may serve you in newness of life.

562
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,040
 To the glory of your name.

563
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,140
 Amen.

564
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,780
 Just allow the Holy Spirit just to work.

565
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,840
 Just as the Lord brings things to your mind,

566
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,040
 offer them to Him.

567
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,980
 Allow Him to work.

568
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,600
 (soft music)

569
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,780
 I believe this is such a significant time for us

570
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,980
 as a church today.

571
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,820
 As we lay down these things before Him.

572
00:34:50,820 --> 00:35:00,860
 You know, this was a sin that happened 22 years beforehand.

573
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,060
 And there may be some things

574
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,940
 that have just been lingering around in your life.

575
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,340
 Just bring them before God.

576
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:17,240
 Holy Spirit, just come as we offer these to you.

577
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:24,780
 Give us assurance of our forgiveness.

578
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,520
 Fill us up, Lord.

579
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,720
 I also feel that while we're on our knees,

580
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,460
 we need to pray for our world today.

581
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:15,100
 This thing of blame, this thing of conflict,

582
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:20,000
 so prevalent in our society all across the world.

583
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,880
 Lord, we pray for country leaders, for church leaders.

584
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,300
 (soft music)

585
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:39,960
 Pray for the need to get before you,

586
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,060
 to get before each other and say, "Sorry."

587
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:53,480
 For this church, Lord divine in you alone,

588
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,480
 I just pray that you will restore relationships.

589
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,120
 Lord, that we would see people with different eyes.

590
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,520
 We see them as you see them.

591
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:12,840
 Help us to be people who are more ready to forgive

592
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,000
 than we are to blame.

593
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:23,400
 Come Holy Spirit and do a new work in our lives.

594
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,800
 Change us from the inside out.

595
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:46,360
 As the band leads us in our final song,

596
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,520
 if you're happy to stay on your knees, just stay here.

597
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,320
 Let's worship God together.

598
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,000
 He's called us to be family.

599
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,460
 He's called us to be one.

600
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,040
 He's called us to be united.

601
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,240
 Take away the love of sinning.

602
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:18,000
 Just bring to your body here, your righteousness,

603
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,160
 your peace and your unity.

604
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
 Let's worship God together.
