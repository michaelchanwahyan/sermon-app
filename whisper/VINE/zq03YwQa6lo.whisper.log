[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   God is so faithful.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.900]   I was adopted, and when I met my birth mum,
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.640]   she said to me that when she gave me up,
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.080]   she didn't even know if God existed,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.440]   but she prayed over me that I would go to a Christian family.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.540]   I'm standing here today as a testament to God's faithfulness.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.440]   And some of you are here today and you don't know God yet,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.000]   but he wrote the pages of your life before you were born,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.840]   and he knew that you'd be here today.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.120]   His goodness is chasing you.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.240]   You need to know that today.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.840]   His goodness is chasing you home.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.560]   Bonfires, I don't know about you,
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.560]   but I feel like this series has come at the perfect time.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.920]   If you're noticing what is going on around you,
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.120]   if you're noticing what is happening
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.720]   to the people that surround your life,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.620]   and if you're noticing what is happening within you,
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.400]   then you will have realized that we are all on journeys
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.920]   that at differing times and in differing ways
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.540]   have become too much.
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.720]   In my early 20s, I can remember a friend saying,
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.860]   "Susanna, you are someone who never gets stressed."
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.040]   She said, "You're always laughing
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.040]   "and you never let anything get to you."
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.080]   Another 30 years down the track,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.120]   I recently caught myself saying to my youngest daughter
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.960]   when we were needing to fill out some paperwork,
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.880]   "I'm feeling overwhelmed.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.600]   "I feel so stressed."
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.960]   And if you're in any doubt that our mental health
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.280]   is connected to our physical health,
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.840]   I then found myself in a clinic talking to a dermatologist
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.680]   and I said, "Why have I got eczema on my hands?
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.600]   "I've never had skin problems in my entire life."
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.840]   And his first question was,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.400]   "Have you been experiencing more stress lately?"
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.480]   By the way, this was in the middle of COVID.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.760]   I was thinking, you're asking that question?
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.480]   I think we've all been experiencing lots of stress.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.480]   In preparing for this sermon, I felt God say to me,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.240]   "I chose you for this.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.040]   "What you've been experiencing in these last few years
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.320]   "mirrors what many have been experiencing in Hong Kong.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.680]   "The disorientation, the sense of loss,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.260]   "the increase in stress and the reaction to it,
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.680]   "the numbness, the lethargy,
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.880]   "the loneliness, the retreating back."
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.720]   So here I am speaking to you today as one on the journey,
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.240]   as one who is still processing her emotions
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.480]   and still learning to be still
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.240]   and listen for his gentle whispers.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.600]   Today we end this series by finishing the story of Elijah,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.720]   ending it with his calling of Elisha.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.640]   We've already learned that Elijah has experienced
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.880]   a journey that has been too much for him,
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.880]   a journey that led him to a place of physical exhaustion,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.200]   a place of emotional despair,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.160]   a place where he literally called on God to let him die.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.760]   God has met him in this place.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.160]   He's touched him and created space for him
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.660]   to process his emotions.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.980]   And as we heard last week,
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.920]   God meets him tenderly in the midst
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.840]   of this complete breakdown.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.080]   God shows him mercy and speaks gently to him
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.020]   in ways that he can receive it.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.400]   And then God tells him that it's time to annoy Elisha
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.720]   to succeed him as a prophet.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.280]   So let's take a look at this last part of Elijah's journey.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.840]   1 Kings 19 verses 19 to 21.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.760]   So Elijah went from there and found Elisha, son of Shaphat.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.960]   He was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.280]   and he himself was driving the 12th pair.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.520]   Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.600]   Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.120]   "Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye," he said.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.760]   "And then I will come with you."
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.960]   "Go back," Elijah replied.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   "What have I done to you?"
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.920]   So Elisha left him and went back.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.640]   He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.320]   He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.840]   and gave it to the people and they ate.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.680]   Then he set out to follow Elijah
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.320]   and become his servant.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.040]   Now you might be asking,
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.400]   how does this end of Elijah's journey,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.040]   the calling of Elisha forth as his successor,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.120]   how is this connected to our mental health journey?
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.560]   I think there are a number of things
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.460]   that we can learn from this passage.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.240]   When God says, Elijah, so earlier in the story,
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.680]   when God says, Elijah, what are you doing here?
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.080]   Part of his answer is, I am the only one left
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.460]   and now they are trying to kill me too.
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.960]   He's saying, I'm on my own, I'm all alone.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.320]   An article that's titled,
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.120]   The Relationship Between Loneliness,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.360]   Psychiatric Disorders and Physical Health says this,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.080]   human beings are social and require safe
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.560]   and secure social surroundings to survive.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.760]   Loneliness can lead to various disorders
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.200]   like depression, alcohol abuse, child abuse,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.360]   sleep problems, personality disorders
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.480]   and even Alzheimer's disease.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.640]   It also leads to various physical disorders.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.240]   Left untended, loneliness can have serious consequences
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.280]   for the mental and physical health of people.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.080]   Like Elijah, a deep sense of loneliness and isolation
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.440]   often contributes to
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.440]   and accompanies mental health issues.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.520]   God understands this.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.040]   And in helping Elijah to move forward and stay healthy,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.880]   he gives him a partner, Elisha.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.160]   He leads him back to connection.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.400]   He leads him back to community.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.120]   Let's pause for a minute.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.400]   I think there is something here
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.100]   that's really important for us to grasp.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.800]   Elijah told God not once, but twice,
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.000]   that he was the only one left.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.240]   Was this true?
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.360]   No.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.800]   God gently reminds him that there were 7,000 others
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.880]   who had not bowed their knee to Baal.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.320]   See, when you are severely stressed
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.000]   or you've been traumatised,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.480]   you can feel completely alone and isolated.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.200]   Elijah completely believed
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.800]   that he was all alone in his journey.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.000]   But his emotions and feelings
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.840]   were not feeding him the truth.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.040]   After Andrew's sermon, Emotional Exhaustion,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.520]   he prayed and he said,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.560]   some of you feel alone all the time.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.000]   But he said, that is not fact.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.840]   He then encouraged us to see a life
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.360]   with a fresh perspective.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.760]   I opened up my hands and I heard God say to me,
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.760]   you are not alone, not family-wise and not friends-wise.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.760]   God spoke the truth into my heart.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.640]   He changed my perspective.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.280]   Our mental health journey
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.400]   is not meant to be travelled alone.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.560]   Connection and community is meant to be a part
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.640]   of our healing and our ongoing health.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.560]   But it doesn't just happen.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.360]   It takes intentionality.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.800]   A regular rhythm needs to be created in our lives.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.040]   At least once a week,
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.040]   deliberately connect with a friend or a family member.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.720]   Work it into your life,
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.160]   set aside time and journey with someone.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.000]   I've set an alarm on my calendar
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.800]   on my phone so that it pops up once a week
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.080]   and says, Susanna, connect with someone.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.600]   Now, you might not need this,
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.160]   but it certainly has helped me,
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.840]   to remind me that I'm not to journey alone
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.920]   and neither are you.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.840]   And then there's connection to professionals.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.720]   In our first week of this series,
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.280]   Andrew gave some pretty raw statistics
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.960]   about mental health in Hong Kong,
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.040]   one in seven people.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.720]   But I think what was more frightening
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.400]   was the fact that out of the people surveyed,
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.760]   the majority said they would not seek
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.160]   any professional help.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:19.920]   When I worked as a member care director for an NGO,
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.880]   we worked to provide counselling for our members
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.200]   before they thought they needed it.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.680]   We encouraged them to debrief with trained people
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.840]   who knew the questions to ask them.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.160]   We encouraged them to do this while they were healthy,
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.760]   to develop a rhythm of regular connection
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.000]   so that they could remain healthy.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.600]   Counselling is often seen as the very last resort,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.120]   but it doesn't have to be.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.480]   Counselling can become a part of our lives
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.280]   that helps us regularly debrief,
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.960]   giving us opportunities to process our emotions
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.600]   and the journey that we are on.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.680]   You can reach out to any of the counselling agencies
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.480]   in Hong Kong, but we also have one ourselves
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.720]   right here as part of our church.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.520]   It's called Oasis, and it's filled
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.280]   with professionally trained counsellors.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.480]   So I would encourage you,
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.480]   if you've never gone to a counselling session,
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.880]   take a risk, you won't regret it.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.240]   Sign up and debrief with someone who's trained
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.360]   to kind of unravel you with the right questions
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.840]   so that you can see what's going on in your journey.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.160]   Let's read the second thing that happens in this passage
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.760]   after Elijah calls Elisha to walk with him,
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.800]   to partner with him in his journey.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.080]   Verse 21 says, "Elisha took his yoke of oxen
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.840]   "and he slaughtered them.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.400]   "He burned the ploughing equipment to cook the meat
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.720]   "and gave it to the people and they ate.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.440]   "Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant."
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.280]   Elisha gathers up all his tools for farming,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.680]   all the things he's used to make his livelihood,
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.880]   and he burns them.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.160]   He creates a great big bonfire.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.360]   It's Elisha's way of demonstrating that he's all in.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.240]   He's showing that he's not leaving any avenue
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.760]   for him to return to his previous life.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.160]   He's 100% committed to pursuing the new.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.600]   How does this connect to mental health, you might be asking?
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   Well, when you are struggling with a mental health issue,
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.560]   our minds have this way of dragging us back
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.640]   and causing us to relive the trauma
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.000]   or relive the painful emotions we are struggling with.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.200]   When we are anxious or fearful, we can feel stuck there.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.960]   It's like ruts in our minds.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.480]   Well-worn paths, we rewalk the same painful memories
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.680]   and we re-feel the same weighty feelings
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.960]   over and over and over again.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.000]   Elisha creates a bonfire
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   because he doesn't want a way back to his old life.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.680]   And in the same way,
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.640]   if we wanna create healthy rhythms in our life,
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.040]   we need to find a way to escape the well-worn ruts
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.320]   in our minds that keep returning us to the past.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.880]   Everybody is different,
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.720]   but I would like to share today how God did this for me.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.560]   On October the 21st, 2005,
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.160]   a dear friend, a mentor, was taken suddenly from my life.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.280]   He called me his little sister.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.800]   And one day he was walking with me around my backyard,
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.400]   chatting with me about the future and encouraging me.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.120]   And the next day he was killed in a car crash.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:02.720]   Some months later, another trauma impacted my life.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.360]   I'm not gonna go into the details
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.520]   because it's not just my story to tell.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.280]   These two traumas brought me to moments
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.840]   like sitting fully clothed under the shower.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.160]   Weeping in distress, in agony of heart,
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.360]   feeling like my heart was being ripped out of my chest,
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.720]   longing for the water to just wash everything away,
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.320]   the memories, the pain.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:33.560]   I started my healing journey by receiving some counselling
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.840]   from somebody I knew and I trusted.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.760]   But I still remember flying into China soon after.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.760]   My job at the time, ironically,
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.160]   was to look after the mental health of the staff
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.120]   of the NGO I was working for.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.800]   While I was there, I was lying on my bed at night
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.200]   and my mind was sending me back to the days of the traumas,
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.840]   causing me to see and feel afresh all the pain and agony
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.920]   like it was happening all over again.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.280]   I was crying out to God to help me
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.120]   and I picked up a book I'd brought with me
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.640]   and it began to speak to me.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.760]   The author was sharing about traumas and brokenness
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.960]   and how we often go back in our minds and relive them.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   The author spoke of creating an off-ramp in our minds.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.400]   When our minds try to steer us down those well-worn ruts,
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.240]   back to pain, back to our despair, back to our anxiety,
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.960]   we say, "No, I'm not going back there."
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.520]   And we force our minds to think
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.440]   of the good things in our life.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.880]   For me, it was things like the beautiful sunset we saw
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.400]   while sitting on the beach at Darwin,
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.640]   the cuddles and warmth of my doggies,
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.840]   the scuba diving trip to the Philippines
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.120]   that my husband and I did for our 20th anniversary,
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.320]   that friend that I have, I won't mention her name,
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.040]   who snorts when she laughs.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.760]   You mentally force your mind
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.520]   from the well-worn ruts onto the off-ramp.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.560]   Now, when I first tried this,
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.680]   I wasn't always completely successful,
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.640]   but the more I practiced it,
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.880]   I found it easier and easier to say,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.160]   "No, I'm not going back there."
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.120]   And finally, today, I can hold both the memories
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.800]   of those two traumas in my mind.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.280]   I can think on them and put them away.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.680]   They no longer tear me apart as they once did.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.640]   Maintaining our mental health and healing
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.840]   as we continue our journeys
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.440]   requires us cutting off the avenues
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.440]   that lead us back to relive our pain, despair,
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.120]   anxious thoughts, and our loneliness.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.840]   To move forward, we'll need to create some bonfires.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.560]   Let me share my experiences with bonfires.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.240]   In Australia, we love a good bonfire.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.720]   In fact, on my last trip back,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.000]   I was able to go to a friend's farm.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.760]   We built a huge bonfire in one of their fields,
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.160]   and we sat around it.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.480]   The mist sort of came in and covered all around us,
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   and there we were around the fire,
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.280]   chatting and sharing life.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.360]   Yes, bonfires are great for burning things,
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.920]   but every time I've gathered around a bonfire,
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.600]   I've enjoyed warmth, community,
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.680]   space under a huge sky,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.680]   slowing down to rediscover the simple things.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.280]   So today I'm gonna use the idea of a bonfire as imagery
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.720]   to help us remember the rhythms we need to create
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.440]   to strengthen our mental health.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   So the first thing you do
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.200]   is you actively build the bonfire.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.760]   You collect the wood and you stack it in a heap.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:11.200]   God did not neglect Elijah's physical wellbeing,
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.280]   and neither should we neglect ours.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.840]   In the first week of this series,
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.240]   Andrew showed how our mind, our heart, and our body
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.760]   are all interconnected.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.840]   If we want to be well in our mental health,
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.560]   we cannot neglect our physical health.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.000]   We need a rhythm of regular exercise,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.360]   and we need to pay attention
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.800]   to what we are putting into our bodies.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.000]   If you're like me,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.880]   get some people to hold you accountable.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.040]   At the moment, I have people around the world
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.240]   holding me accountable to 30 minutes of exercise a day.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.880]   I started, I got very techie,
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.320]   and I started a hashtag called #EncourageAndExercise,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.800]   and there's people around the world who join me every day
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.440]   to remind each other that we can do it together.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.640]   And that's probably the next point I want to make.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.880]   Don't try and do it by yourself.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.160]   Do this with a team.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.880]   Get someone, grab a friend,
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.000]   join a group of hikers or tennis players,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.400]   or whatever it is that you really love to do.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.080]   Create a rhythm.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.360]   An article called "Exercise for Mental Health" states,
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.480]   "Exercise improves mental health
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:34.040]   by reducing anxiety, depression, and negative mood.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.880]   It also improves your self-esteem
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.960]   and your cognitive function."
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.200]   So after you've actively built the bonfire,
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.840]   you gather around it with people you love
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.240]   and want to connect to.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.400]   The bonfire is a place of community.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.160]   To stay healthy,
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.200]   we need to create regular rhythms of connection,
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.040]   ensuring that feelings of isolation
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.920]   and loneliness are burnt up on the bonfire.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.000]   Elijah needed to be directed
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.520]   and encouraged to connect again.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.760]   God said, and I'm paraphrasing here,
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.840]   "Go back, meet with and anoint Haziel.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.000]   Connect with Jehu, son of Nimshi,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.920]   and anoint him king over Israel,
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.440]   and then call Elijah or Elisha to walk with you
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.240]   and succeed you as prophet."
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.920]   Like Elijah, some of us here today
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.920]   need to be reminded to rediscover and create connections.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.120]   In regards to our mental health,
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.680]   community is not an add-on that we choose if we want to.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.400]   Community is a God-designed necessity.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:54.200]   Number three, around the bonfire you stop.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.400]   You're still and you gaze at the fire,
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.520]   you listen to the crackle of the flames.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.240]   Last week, Andrew said that in Hong Kong,
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.000]   it's always the wind, it's always the earthquake,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.400]   it's always the fire.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:14.200]   Is it any wonder that we feel windblown,
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.080]   that we feel shaken, that some of us feel burnt?
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:24.200]   We need stillness in our lives.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.280]   For the sake of our mental health,
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.640]   we need to hear the still, small voice of God.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.960]   There was a reason God sent Elijah on a 40-day
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.680]   and a 40-night hike to Mount Horeb.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.440]   On that trek, it was just him and God.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.480]   At night, I'm sure he sat around a fire
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.520]   and looked at the stars and was still.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:52.200]   God created the Sabbath for a reason, it was rest.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.880]   God rested and we're created in His image.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.400]   We need rest.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.120]   Sabbath is a rhythm God created to ensure
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.840]   we stay healthy and we stay balanced.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.240]   Many of us here today are out of balance.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.160]   Many of us need to reestablish a Sabbath in our lives
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.240]   where we stop, where we listen for God's gentle whispers
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.120]   and respond to His touch and His leading.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:29.920]   Lastly, you use the time around the bonfire
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.320]   to burn things that shouldn't be carried anymore.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:39.760]   You release burdens, baggage, anxious thoughts,
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:45.280]   all the weight of the week or maybe the weight of years
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.320]   into the flames of God's love.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.400]   Knowing that when you walk away into a new week,
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   you walk in newness, you walk with a renewed mind and heart.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.840]   When Elisha burnt all his farming tools,
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.480]   he decluttered his life, he made space for the new.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.400]   We need to create a rhythm of decluttering in our lives.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.760]   There are things we are carrying
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.120]   that we need to place into the fire.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.880]   This releasing happens through prayer.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.320]   In regards to mental health, prayer is your biggest weapon.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:29.400]   The Bible puts it like this, be anxious for nothing,
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.840]   but in everything by prayer and supplication
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.000]   and thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.400]   And the peace of God which surpasses all understanding
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   We release our past and our future anxieties
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.040]   by making them known to God.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.720]   He already knows them, but in us choosing to share them
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.520]   with him, to offer them to him,
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.240]   we are relinquishing our control and inviting God
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.680]   to join us in our journey.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.560]   And when we use this incredible gift of prayer,
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.400]   God sends his peace.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.440]   Not just any peace,
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.720]   but one that goes past all of our understanding.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.960]   It doesn't make sense to us in the circumstances
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.520]   we're in that we could be feeling so peaceful.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.320]   That's what it means, a peace that passes all understanding,
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.320]   one that guards and protects your mind and your heart.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.560]   I'm gonna invite the worship team to come.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.200]   Would you stand with me?
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.800]   Stand with me.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.640]   We're gonna have a practical time now
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.280]   of prayer and thanksgiving.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:00.720]   Just close your eyes with me.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:06.880]   What needs to be burnt up in your life?
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:14.440]   What needs to be decluttered from you?
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.040]   (gentle music)
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.520]   Do you need to create some space
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.720]   for the new things God has for you?
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:35.160]   Andrew had this picture while we were praying earlier
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.680]   of someone with darts in their back,
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.080]   thrown by the enemy.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.400]   And he saw Jesus just come and place himself
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.760]   between the enemy and the person
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.200]   with the darts in their back, protecting them.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.880]   And there was this sense of great vulnerability
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.560]   in this person that they didn't have
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.120]   the strength to defend themselves.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:09.920]   And so I wanna start by speaking to those
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.920]   who feel vulnerable, who feel like they have darts
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.640]   in their back and they cannot defend themselves.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:27.760]   God would remind you that he stands in the gap for you.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.480]   And Pastor John took the picture further
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.120]   by saying that it's not meant to just be Jesus
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.960]   who stands in the gap.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.120]   It's meant to be this body, this community
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.880]   that we're meant to stretch out our arms as well
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.320]   and stand in the gap.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.040]   And during worship, I had this strong sense
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.640]   to speak to parents,
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.040]   parents who are standing in the gap for their kids.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.200]   And some of you are feeling so overwhelmed.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.760]   You love your kids so much.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.080]   But there's such a fear in you of where their life is going
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.880]   and where their life is taking them.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.680]   And you wonder whether it's worth standing in the gap
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.040]   for them anymore.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.400]   And God would encourage you today, don't stop.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   Keep standing in the gap.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.520]   It matters.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.560]   It's making a difference.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.400]   Don't give up.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.000]   (gentle music)
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.200]   If you're feeling vulnerable without the strength
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.640]   even to pray for yourself,
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.640]   would you put your hands out in front of you as a sign
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.120]   to the people around you and to God
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:59.280]   that you need God and us to stand in the gap for you?
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.320]   Would you do that for me?
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.240]   Would you just reach out your hands in front of you
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:08.240]   so that we can see, so that we can come and stand alongside?
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.040]   Maybe just look around you.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.960]   If you see somebody with their hands open,
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.400]   maybe just stand with them.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.240]   Don't have to say anything, just stand with them.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:26.440]   Father, I lift up those who've come today.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:31.080]   Bow down heavy with burdens.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.640]   (gentle music)
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.080]   With very little strength
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:40.400]   and no capacity to even raise their voice for help.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:46.360]   Father, you see, you understand,
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.280]   and you brought them here for this moment.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.760]   So Father, we surround them.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.120]   We choose as a community to stand in the gap for them.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.400]   To say that we will protect you.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.000]   We will stand between you and the dart thrower.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.440]   We will pray protection over you
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.160]   and walk with you until you're strong enough
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.480]   to pray for yourself and to walk your journey again.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:22.120]   And for the rest of us,
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.800]   we're just gonna take some time.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.560]   The worship team is gonna just sing over us.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.760]   We're just gonna take some time to be still.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.360]   We're gonna create some space
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.720]   and you're gonna picture yourself walking up
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.720]   to that bonfire and throwing in the things
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.440]   that you know you shouldn't be carrying anymore.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:54.560]   Putting in all the anxious thoughts, the future fears,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.640]   putting them into God's hands, throwing them into the flames.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.160]   Let's just take some time
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.120]   and let's do that together right now.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.700]   (gentle music)
