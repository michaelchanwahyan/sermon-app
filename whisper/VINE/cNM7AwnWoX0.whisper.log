[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Have you ever noticed how there are different seasons in your life?
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.200]   If you look back,
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.680]   you can see those seasons where things were flourishing
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.800]   and there was a good harvest.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.480]   Or maybe there was a time
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.200]   where it felt like the ground was very tough and frozen,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.080]   and you had to dig very hard to plant anything.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.440]   Maybe it felt like everything was going wrong,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.200]   or you lost someone special.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.480]   In my experience, you cannot have one season without the other.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.480]   The things that you learn in the tough seasons
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.360]   shape and mold you for the easier seasons.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.600]   But in every season of life,
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.200]   God is with us, helping us, leading us,
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.400]   watching over us, and keeping us.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.080]   It's always good to take time to stop
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.480]   and take stock of where we are in life.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.240]   It helps us to gain perspective,
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.080]   and I have found that it grows my faith for the future.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.280]   I think we can all agree that the past three years in Hong Kong
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.200]   have been challenging.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.960]   But through it all, God has been faithful.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.200]   Amen?
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.560]   Perhaps you remember last year
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.600]   when Pastor Promise preached about Caleb following God wholeheartedly.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.720]   If you haven't heard that, I recommend that you listen to it.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.320]   God asked me if I would follow him wholeheartedly to Portugal.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.720]   My husband, Graham, and I had been talking about
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.320]   where we would go in the future,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.520]   and I was thinking 20 years' time.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.600]   But God moved the timetable forward,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.800]   and we will be relocating very soon.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.480]   As I reflect over our time in Hong Kong and at the Vine,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   I can see how God has been working faithfully for our good.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.400]   He has always guided us gently
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.760]   and has often given us time to prepare,
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.240]   but not always.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.880]   He has given me different assignments for different seasons.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.360]   You may not have heard this language
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.560]   of God giving you an assignment before.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.120]   It's simply what God is asking you to do
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.560]   for a season in your life.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.600]   My prayer for our time together today
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.160]   is that you will have your assignment confirmed,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.560]   or if you didn't know what an assignment was before,
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.280]   you will discover what God's assignment for you is.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.200]   As Pastor Jeff was saying last week,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.760]   our vocation is an all-of-life calling,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.480]   and not just about our careers or our profession.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.160]   In the same way, God's assignment for you
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.280]   is for all areas of your life,
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.040]   your work, your rest, your family,
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.160]   and when you have time to play.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   It's amazing to see how God works in every area of our lives
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.280]   and how he is the one helper we can rely on.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:00.400]   Moving to Portugal is a very difficult step for me,
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.760]   and to be honest, I am struggling to be obedient,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.680]   but as Emma says, obedience is God's love language.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.920]   I have been sitting in Psalm 121
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.840]   since the fast finished in January,
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.320]   and my constant prayer has been,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.000]   "Help me, Lord," because he is our helper.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.200]   By sitting in Psalm 121,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.440]   I mean that I have been reading it,
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.560]   praying it through, journaling about it,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.600]   pondering about it,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.920]   and allowing it to soak deep into my soul.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.920]   It has been a source of strength and comfort for me.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.880]   So let's take a look at Psalm 121 together.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.720]   A song of ascents.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.280]   I lift up my eyes to the mountains.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.600]   Where does my help come from?
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.000]   My help comes from the Lord.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.080]   The Maker of heaven and earth.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.160]   He will not let your foot slip.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.760]   He who watches over you will not slumber.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.880]   Indeed, he who watches over Israel
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.640]   will neither slumber nor sleep.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.400]   The Lord watches over you.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.960]   The Lord is your shade at your right hand.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.520]   The shade at your right hand.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.440]   The sun will not harm you by day,
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.440]   nor the moon by night.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.200]   The Lord will keep you from all harm.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.400]   He will watch over your life.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.560]   The Lord will watch over your coming and going,
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.000]   both now and forevermore.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.720]   Amen.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.200]   Let's unpack the poem together.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.360]   Psalm 121 was written in the time
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.320]   when Israel was in exile in Babylon.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.560]   There was a long distance and a desert
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   between where they were in Babylon and to Jerusalem.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.960]   And a mountain range separated the two lands.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.160]   Let's imagine that we're on the journey together
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.280]   and think about how the different parts
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.360]   of the Psalm would apply.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.040]   I lift up my eyes to the hills
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.640]   was a reference to the mountain range
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.360]   between Babylon and Jerusalem.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.320]   And the idea that Jerusalem sat just over
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.440]   the other side of the hill.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.360]   The city was out of sight, but not out of mind.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.520]   Where does my help come from
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.120]   echoes the need that they have for help
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.360]   because they're in captivity in Babylon
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.760]   and want to be released to go back to Jerusalem.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:15.440]   But it is also a statement that help won't come from war,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.960]   from Israel fighting or taking up arms.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.280]   The help to get back to Jerusalem can only come from God,
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.200]   the maker of heaven and earth.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.680]   He will not let your foot slip is a reference
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.880]   to the hard journey of hiking over the mountain range
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.960]   back to Jerusalem, a treacherous journey
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.800]   where they could easily slip and fall.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.960]   The shade at your right hand was important
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.440]   because the right hand was the part of the body
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.160]   used for holding a sword.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.520]   And in the left, they held a shield.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   What the poem is saying is that God protects his people,
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.160]   shading them on the right side
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.080]   so they can be most effective in life.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.520]   God shades us and protects us so we can move forward
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.880]   and face whatever circumstances come towards us.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:26.560]   Finally, the poem is a song of ascent.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.080]   It is the second Psalm in the 15 songs of ascent,
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.160]   which means that it was eventually used
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.800]   in the religious festivals in Jerusalem
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.840]   in the second temple period
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.880]   after Israel returned from exile, just as God said.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.720]   It was especially sung as pilgrims are walking
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.800]   up the hill of Mount Zion towards the temple,
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.560]   which stood on the hill.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.640]   I have heard the songs of ascent referred to
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.720]   as pilgrim songs.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.320]   I like that imagery because we are all on a journey together
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.760]   which is why our community is so important.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:15.120]   I've been struck recently by how active God is in this Psalm.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.360]   We can see that he helps us in verse two.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.640]   He watches over us in verses three to five and seven to eight
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.520]   and he keeps us safe in verse seven.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.640]   Knowing that God is so active has been very encouraging
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.400]   to me over the past few months
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.520]   when things have been very uncertain
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.640]   as we've moved towards moving to Portugal.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.800]   As we often sing, even when I don't see it, you're working.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.080]   Even when I don't feel it, you're working.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.880]   Let me tell you about our journey to Hong Kong,
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.720]   how I discovered my assignments
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.120]   and the ways that God has been faithful
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.120]   whilst we've been here in Asia.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.440]   God gave me my first assignment when I was 12.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.600]   I read Jackie Pullinger's book, "Chasing the Dragon".
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.200]   Maybe some of you have read it.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.280]   To be honest, it terrified me.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.280]   God told me then that I would serve him in Hong Kong
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.960]   and I was very worried about that
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.040]   because I did not like the idea
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.480]   of working with scary drug addicts,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.400]   even if Holy Spirit was involved.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.240]   So I forgot all about it.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.600]   It was only after we'd moved to Hong Kong
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.080]   and Jackie came to preach at the Vine
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.080]   that I remembered what God had said to me when I was 12,
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.200]   even though I had forgotten.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.600]   God had not and I have served him in Hong Kong.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:07.080]   The next assignment that I remember was in June 2006
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.400]   when Graham and I were living in England.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.240]   I was a teacher at the time
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.240]   and was very involved with my church.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.880]   Graham was asked to move to Hong Kong by his company.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.560]   In the August, I felt that God had confirmed
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.160]   that he was calling us to Hong Kong in many ways,
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.360]   one of them being that there was a typo
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.840]   in my teaching contract.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.040]   So instead of needing to give one year's notice,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.160]   I only needed to give one term's notice
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.600]   and that felt huge at the time.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.760]   I resigned from my teaching job in August,
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.480]   but then we did not hear any details
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.480]   about Hong Kong in September or October or November.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   And then in the middle of December,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.600]   we were told that we needed to be in Hong Kong
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.240]   on the 4th of January.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.400]   If God hadn't confirmed the assignment
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.600]   and told us to prepare,
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.400]   we had not have been able to move
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.760]   and arrive in Hong Kong on time.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.920]   God truly was our helper, as it says in verse one,
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.320]   as we worked through all of the things
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.720]   that were necessary to move continents.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:30.320]   Two months later, I slipped my L5-S1 disc in my back
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.280]   and it herniated and it caused nerve damage
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.920]   in my right leg.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.560]   So I now walk on a leg that my brain tells me is not there.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.600]   And that has been really helpful for me
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.320]   not to believe everything I think
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.720]   because we know that our minds and our thoughts
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.560]   can sometimes lead us astray, don't we?
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.600]   While I was learning to walk with a stick,
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.200]   I was aware that my next assignment
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   was to get more involved at the Vine,
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.760]   but I didn't know how or when.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.480]   I'd been taught by my pastor, Rob, in England,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.440]   not to move until God said.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.200]   So I was trying to wait patiently
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.320]   for God to tell me to move.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.720]   Two months later in May,
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.400]   a publicity postcard from GOD, Goods of Desire,
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.600]   was pushed under the door of our apartment,
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.240]   which I now know is very rare in Hong Kong.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.400]   The postcard said, "Delay no more."
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.240]   Now I understand that in Cantonese,
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.960]   there is another meaning.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.280]   But at that time,
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.840]   I took that to be a signpost to contact the Vine.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.360]   So I sent an email.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.200]   I started volunteering in the office the next day.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.320]   And I now know that God can use many and varied things
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.400]   to help us to discover an assignment.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.160]   During that summer, I was asked to help
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.000]   with some of our refugees and asylum seekers,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.800]   who numbered about 30 at the time.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.880]   It's been amazing to see how God has grown that community
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.520]   to become road and arise.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.320]   Many of our brothers and sisters in this community
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.560]   have amazing stories of God's faithfulness.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.040]   And I really encourage you to get to know them
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.960]   and hear some of their stories.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.200]   It will encourage you.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.040]   Shortly after this, I met Marina,
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.280]   who we said goodbye to last year.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   And I got to know some of our Filipina sisters.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.720]   It has been a huge privilege to serve and learn so much
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.480]   from our Filipino community.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.000]   Our brothers and sisters there, whom we now call Philcom.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.840]   They know how important it is to pray
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.280]   and that God answers our prayers in many and varied ways.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:14.640]   In 2010, I had an ectopic pregnancy,
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.400]   which caused very serious medical complications
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.560]   and it took me about a year to recover from it.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.480]   I know that during that time, God was watching me.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.360]   And I know that he did not slumber or sleep
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.920]   during that really difficult time, as it says in verse four.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.760]   It was during that time that God gave me another assignment,
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.080]   to pray and sing.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   This assignment really helped me to discern
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.360]   what I should say yes to
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.120]   and what I should say no to more easily.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.160]   The next year, the Vine moved from Central to Wanchai,
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.560]   to Vine Center 2, where we are now.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:09.440]   I still have a wow moment whenever I enter this building,
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.920]   as I remember what it used to look like
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.280]   and how God changed it from a dilapidated building
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.720]   that was not used very much,
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.160]   to the 24/7 ministry space, pandemic excluded,
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.720]   that we have today.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.120]   Every time I step into this auditorium,
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.360]   I'm reminded about God's faithfulness
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.640]   and that if he says he will do something, he will do it.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:43.000]   Over the years, this assignment to pray and sing
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.120]   developed into praying and walking with women
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.320]   and more involvement with the worship team.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.480]   During this time, I went to New Zealand
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.920]   to attend my friend Sharon's wedding
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.120]   and the day after, I was sitting in her church,
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.960]   minding my own business,
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.680]   when halfway through the sermon,
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.280]   her pastor stopped and went, "You!"
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.800]   He looked directly at me
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.600]   and he said that God had given me a gift of healing
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.840]   and that he would use me to bring healing to many people.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:23.840]   Then in 2016, I discerned with my spiritual friend Julie
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.600]   that God was changing my assignment from pray and sing
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.400]   to love God, love people.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:37.680]   As I look back, I can see how all my experiences in England
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.200]   and at The Vine to that point
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.680]   were my training grounds for this assignment
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.920]   and my current role at The Vine.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.520]   God never wastes anything.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.520]   He has used the gifts he gave me in various ways.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.520]   He has used my teaching gift in Arise and Philcom and Tribe.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:07.240]   He's used my healing gift with many people in Hong Kong.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.280]   He's shown me how loving God and loving people
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   can be inspiring, challenging, frustrating,
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.800]   and a huge privilege.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:29.160]   He has also shown me that ASAP stands for something
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.040]   other than as soon as possible.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:38.680]   He's shown me that it also stands for always stop and pray.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:47.360]   I was expecting to be at The Vine
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.040]   and in Hong Kong for another 20 years,
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.800]   but as you know, that was not God's plan.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.080]   Our belongings are in a container
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.720]   somewhere between here and Rotterdam.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:05.360]   Our visa application has been accepted,
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.200]   but we don't know if we will be given a visa
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.040]   or when we will be able to fly to Portugal.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   But as we've seen in the past,
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.520]   God has been faithful and I know
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.640]   he will be faithful in the future.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:28.040]   As Graham and I come to the end of our time in Hong Kong,
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.560]   God has given me a new assignment for Portugal.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.640]   It is be a sheep.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.880]   I do not know what that looks like yet,
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.680]   but God knows that I will be a sheep.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.080]   But God knows me well and I think he's encouraging me
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.600]   not to jump in straight away in a new church,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.600]   but to rest and spend time with the shepherd first.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:01.720]   I expect that I will spend time sitting in Psalm 23
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.960]   when we go to Portugal later.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:11.760]   You may be asking, how do I discern an assignment?
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.600]   When you are discerning an assignment,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.760]   remember, only you can be you.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:25.760]   God has created you for a purpose.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:31.600]   He will lead you to where your specific gifts,
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.720]   talents and character
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.120]   will help him to work his purposes out.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.640]   Spend time with God in prayer
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.880]   and ask him to show you what your assignment is.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.000]   Then check you've heard God right
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.040]   by talking to your spiritual friend or your community group.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:06.640]   Another way is what I call God incidences.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.280]   It's my play on the word coincidence.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:20.480]   And it means chance or luck, but I don't believe in those.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.040]   I believe that God is at work in my life and your life
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.280]   and he can arrange for things to happen.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.040]   Remember the postcard under our apartment door?
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.600]   Another way is what I call the rule of three.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:47.040]   I don't know about you, but sometimes I'm a little slow
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.000]   to work out that God's talking to me.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.440]   But he is so kind.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.960]   He often says something three or more, if I need it,
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.560]   times in different ways.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:06.440]   Perhaps the first way is in my daily devotion.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.440]   Then perhaps someone might mention the same thing
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.680]   in a conversation I'm having.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.880]   And then maybe the preacher,
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.800]   usually our wonderful senior pastor, Andrew,
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.680]   will mention the same thing in a sermon.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.840]   By that point, I usually realize
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.480]   God is drawing my attention to something.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.000]   Then we have plus, minus, and interesting.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.200]   This is when I'm trying to make a decision about something.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.760]   I have three boxes in my head.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.760]   Again, I'm on the lookout for ways
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.480]   that God might be speaking.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.240]   He may use something a friend says, sermons,
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.680]   daily devotion, something we discuss in community group,
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.240]   a song on the radio, a billboard on an advert.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.560]   God speaks in myriad ways.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.920]   If it is something that seems to confirm
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.360]   that I should be doing that thing,
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.520]   I put it in the plus box in my head.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.520]   Then if I notice something that seems to confirm
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   that I shouldn't be doing something,
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.400]   I put it in the minus box in my head.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.600]   But then sometimes something happens
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.360]   and it just doesn't fit neatly into the plus or the minus.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.360]   So that's when it goes in the interesting box.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.760]   And I discern with my spiritual friend, Julie,
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.000]   what that could mean.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.160]   And then finally, we have when you just know in your knower.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:59.920]   As we grow closer to God,
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.160]   the Holy Spirit becomes a larger part in our lives.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.560]   And we are able to discern how to think or speak
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.200]   or act in different situations.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.880]   And we often act differently than we would have done before.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:22.240]   You may meet someone and you just know
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.840]   that God wants you to help them
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.960]   or encourage them or something else.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.440]   When you know something in your knower,
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.280]   you have peace that is the right thing to do.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.920]   But at that moment, you may not know how to do it.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:47.640]   I'm sorry that this is not a more concrete action point,
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.400]   but I really encourage you to spend time
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.720]   developing your knower.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.480]   When you discover your assignment,
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.560]   ask God what he wants you to be doing.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:08.560]   Remember to love people and ask yourself and God
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.800]   how you can love people well in each situation
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.240]   that you are faced with.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.320]   That might be like saying something encouraging
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.160]   instead of criticizing someone.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.840]   Or taking a subordinate out for lunch or coffee
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.520]   and asking them how they're doing.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:35.520]   Or making a new friend in our congregation,
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.880]   possibly even the person
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.280]   that you're sitting next to right now.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:47.280]   As we've been journeying together this morning,
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.800]   have you been sensing what your assignment is?
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.240]   God will have one for you,
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.680]   whatever stage of life you are in.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.960]   Let's just take some time to reflect.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:06.080]   If you already have an assignment,
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.600]   you might like to spend some time with God
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.240]   and review how your assignment is going.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.520]   If it is going well, praise God.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.000]   But if there are areas of struggle,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   and there usually are, ask the helper of Psalm 121
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.680]   to help you.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.840]   If you don't have an assignment yet,
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.800]   I encourage you to ask God for one.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.040]   Remember that it will be tailor-made for you,
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:44.000]   your gifts, your talents, and your character,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.640]   because only you can be you.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.520]   And do you have a spiritual friend
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.440]   who could help you to sense and discern the signposts
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.440]   and the assignments in your life?
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.960]   If you don't know what a spiritual friend is,
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.800]   you can follow this link to find out more.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:09.360]   You can also ask God to show you who you could ask.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.040]   That's how I found my spiritual friend, Julie.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.240]   (silence)
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.840]   I'd love it if we could pray together
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.600]   with each other about this.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.360]   Shall we stand together to pray?
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.080]   (soft music)
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:44.440]   Loving God, thank you that you have an assignment
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.400]   for each one of us.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.560]   Thank you that you help us with it.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.320]   You watch over us.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.200]   You keep us.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.640]   Help us to know in our knowers
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.200]   what it is you are asking us to do.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:08.800]   And help us to know that whatever you ask us to do,
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.560]   you will give us everything that we need to do it.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.640]   (soft music)
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.280]   Lord, I pray especially for any one of us
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:23.120]   who don't feel that we're worthy or good enough
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.960]   for an assignment from you.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:30.240]   Help us to know that as your child, we are worthy
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.280]   because you love us.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.440]   And you want us to become more and more
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.480]   as you created us to be.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.960]   (soft music)
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.960]   Help us to love you, God.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:52.040]   Help us to love each other and grow in you.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.560]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
