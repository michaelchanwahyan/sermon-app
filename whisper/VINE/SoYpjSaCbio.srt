1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
 How are you, you well?

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,440
 We're finishing our series in Psalm 23 today,

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,640
 and I'm super excited about that.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,640
 If you've been coming to the Vine for the last few weeks,

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,120
 hopefully this has been an encouraging series for you.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,320
 And we're finishing on a note of great encouragement.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,680
 I just absolutely love the way

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,560
 that David finishes off the Psalm,

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,760
 'cause the Psalm's been pretty challenging.

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,680
 And if you've been coming here over the last few weeks,

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,840
 you would've noticed that David uses metaphor and imagery

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,520
 to shake up the status quo, to challenge us deeply

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,400
 on how we understand God, and also how we are to live

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,760
 in this world around us.

15
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,000
 And there's been some weeks over this series

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,520
 where there's been a pretty deep uprooting

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,680
 and a pretty strong move of the Spirit

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,440
 to shake the dust off of us and get us into a place

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,520
 where we can really walk with God.

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,560
 But then David gets to the end of the Psalm,

21
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,680
 and he wants to finish on a note of encouragement,

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,840
 a note of life, a note of inspiration and love.

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,240
 And that's really what's on my heart for all of us here

24
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,120
 this morning online in this room.

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,120
 I want you to know one really critical thing.

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,320
 And that is that God is pursuing you right now.

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,360
 That He loves you so much

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,960
 that He is never gonna give up on you.

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,400
 That He is pursuing you, chasing you down,

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
 hunting you down, wanting to be with you,

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,360
 wanting to shape and form you into the person that He has,

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,000
 and that He will do everything possible

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,120
 to make His goodness be known to you,

34
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,600
 to make His love be known to you.

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,160
 And I don't know how you're feeling today.

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,160
 I don't know how you are coming into this room,

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,320
 coming into this moment.

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,400
 Some of you have had amazing weeks.

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,040
 Some of you have had challenging weeks.

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,880
 Some of you are in a season of great inspiration right now.

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,800
 Other of you are in seasons of difficulty and trial.

42
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
 And a number of you have been coming forward

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,120
 and sharing some of those trials with us.

44
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,320
 And we're with you as a church community.

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,480
 Whatever is going on in your life right now,

46
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,560
 God is pursuing you.

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,080
 He loves you so much.

48
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,800
 And He wants you to know what is on His heart for you.

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,480
 And He will do whatever it takes

50
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,520
 to make His heart manifest and known to you.

51
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,440
 I wanna share a little story about that

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,560
 and how I've experienced that a little bit in my life

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,440
 as we start our time together today.

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,920
 Back in 2003, which seems a long time ago,

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,200
 almost 20 years ago,

56
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,120
 I went to the Hillsong Conference in Sydney, Australia.

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,800
 And I don't know if you've ever been

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,920
 to the Hillsong Conference or a conference like it,

59
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,920
 but in 2003, the Hillsong Conference was 30,000 people.

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,120
 They had 30,000 people signed up for this conference.

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,160
 The venue that was hosting the conference

62
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,040
 only sat 15,000 people.

63
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,240
 So every single main session,

64
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,480
 they had to run it twice to get everybody in that session.

65
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,140
 So literally, they would get everybody into this room,

66
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,560
 all 15,000 people in the room.

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,400
 They would do the whole main session.

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,360
 Then immediately the 15,000 people would leave

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
 and a new 15,000 people would come in

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,440
 and they would do that whole session all over again

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,840
 with the new 15,000 people.

72
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,320
 And that would happen throughout the whole conference.

73
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,520
 So when you signed up for the conference that year,

74
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,480
 you were given a little ticket that said,

75
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,780
 you're gonna go to the first part of that session

76
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,240
 or you're gonna go to the second part.

77
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,320
 You'd get the ticket and that's how you would know

78
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,080
 which session you were going to go into.

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,000
 Now in 2003, about 50 of us from the Vine

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,240
 went to the conference together.

81
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,480
 We traveled together.

82
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,760
 We got all the tickets for the same sessions together.

83
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,740
 It was an amazing experience.

84
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,760
 But on one afternoon,

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,680
 on the Thursday afternoon of the conference,

86
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,360
 I couldn't make the session

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,880
 that our whole team was gonna be attending.

88
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,920
 So I had to go to the alternate session

89
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
 of that particular time.

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,760
 So I went to the main desk and I said,

91
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,160
 "Look, can I exchange my ticket?"

92
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,080
 They're like, "Yes, you can."

93
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,000
 And they gave me a ticket for that other session.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Now, this was a brand new 15,000 people that I had not seen

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,920
 'cause I was in the other sessions

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,840
 and in that track for the whole conference up to that point.

97
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,200
 But I remember, I'm an extrovert, right?

98
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
 And I love being around people,

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
 but I was super excited to go to a session

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
 at the conference completely on my own.

101
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,900
 Not having to be a leader of the 50 people from the Vine

102
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,040
 that was at the conference,

103
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,220
 not having to think about anything.

104
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,080
 I could just go myself, worship the Lord, be left alone.

105
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
 No one would know me, completely anonymous.

106
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,200
 I was super excited about it.

107
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,040
 So I get into the main session,

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,280
 15,000 people that I've never seen before

109
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,440
 and the worship starts.

110
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,640
 And again, if you've never been in an experience

111
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,600
 where 15,000 people are gathering to worship Jesus,

112
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,320
 it is amazing.

113
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,600
 And so we start worshiping and my arms are up in the air

114
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,720
 like they are here at the Vine every week

115
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,120
 and I'm just worshiping away.

116
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,880
 And as soon as I start to worship,

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,760
 God gives me a word, a prophetic word

118
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,000
 for the young lady standing in front of me.

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And he says this, "Andrew, you need to tell

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,680
 the young lady standing in front of you

121
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,800
 that her husband really does love her."

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,720
 Uh-oh.

123
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,360
 Now, let me explain something.

124
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,560
 When I sometimes get these kinds of words,

125
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,880
 if they are like about a relationship with a woman

126
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,780
 or something like that,

127
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,560
 I would normally take my wife, Christine,

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,260
 and I would say, "Hey, Chris, I've got this word

129
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,840
 for this young lady in front of us.

130
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,040
 Would you deliver that word?"

131
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
 And it would be Chris that would pass on that word.

132
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,920
 But I was on my own, no one else was there.

133
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,400
 And I'm worshiping away and God is relentless.

134
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,080
 He's like, "Andrew, you need to tell the young lady

135
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,600
 in front of you that her husband

136
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,800
 really does actually love her."

137
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,760
 And I'm thinking to myself, what if she's not even married?

138
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,800
 And as she's worshiping away,

139
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,480
 I'm trying to look for a wedding ring on her finger,

140
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,200
 which is really creepy.

141
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,240
 That's kind of creepy.

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,560
 Then I'm sort of like looking at this

143
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,760
 and there's no wedding ring on her finger.

144
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,600
 And I'm thinking to myself,

145
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,240
 this would be the most embarrassing thing.

146
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,400
 Could you imagine me leaning forward,

147
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,920
 tapping her on the shoulder and saying,

148
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,400
 "Excuse me, we don't know each other,

149
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,920
 but I'm a pastor from Hong Kong.

150
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,200
 And I just want you to know that the Lord

151
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,320
 has a word for you and that your husband

152
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,780
 really does love you."

153
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,560
 I'm not married.

154
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,000
 Have a great conference.

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,720
 So I'm worshiping and God is saying,

156
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,280
 "You gotta give this word."

157
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,120
 And here's what I say to God.

158
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,720
 I say, "God, I'm not a prophet.

159
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,640
 I'm not a prophet.

160
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,200
 Like I'm a pastor, I'm not a prophet.

161
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,800
 That's not a, that's not something that,

162
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,320
 that gift that I walk in.

163
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,600
 That's not something that I generally do.

164
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,760
 I'm not a prophet.

165
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,520
 Just find someone else."

166
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,560
 And so I carry on worshiping, slightly guilty,

167
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,440
 but carrying on worshiping.

168
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,440
 And God's got such a sense of humor, hasn't he?

169
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,720
 So as I continue to worship, guess what God does?

170
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,600
 He then gives me a word for the guy standing on my right,

171
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,880
 right next to me.

172
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,680
 And he says, "Oh, Pastor Andrew,

173
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,720
 you need to tell the guy on your right,

174
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,240
 you know, he's a pastor of a church.

175
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,760
 And you need to tell him that I'm about to pour out

176
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,240
 my spirit on his church like never before.

177
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,680
 In fact, it's gonna be like an Ezekiel 42 moment.

178
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,160
 Like the river of God is gonna flow out of the sanctuary

179
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,360
 into his town.

180
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,200
 And it's gonna be a revival of the spirit of God happening.

181
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,800
 You need to tell this pastor that I'm about to move

182
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,720
 like a river in his church by my spirit.

183
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,680
 And I'm feeling this whole thing in me.

184
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,320
 And I'm wondering, I don't even know if he's a pastor.

185
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,480
 And so as I'm worshiping, I'm sneaking glances at him

186
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,520
 to see maybe he looks like a pastor.

187
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,840
 I don't know what a pastor looks like.

188
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,240
 But as I'm looking at this guy,

189
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,000
 he doesn't look anything like a pastor, okay?

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,480
 He actually looked like somebody

191
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,880
 in the Hell's Angel Motorcycle Club, okay?

192
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,400
 He had a leather jacket on, he had a big beer belly,

193
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,980
 he had like a big bushy beard.

194
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,520
 This guy did not look like what I thought maybe pastors,

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,920
 I don't know, whatever looked like.

196
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,880
 But I'm kind of sneaking glances at him.

197
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
 He's worshiping away, but he's suddenly realizing

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,040
 that the weird guy next to him is keeping looking at him.

199
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,440
 So he starts sneaking glances at me,

200
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,920
 sneaking glances at him.

201
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,000
 And as he's like sneaking glances at me,

202
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,800
 he starts to turn towards me.

203
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,680
 I start to turn towards him.

204
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,940
 And as we lock eyes together, and this is a true story,

205
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,880
 we lock eyes together, we turn to each other

206
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,800
 and we spontaneously hug.

207
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,000
 (congregation laughing)

208
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,680
 You know, like a man hug.

209
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,420
 You know, like, "Oh!"

210
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,120
 (congregation laughing)

211
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,880
 "Don't know, this guy, never spoken to him."

212
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,760
 We're like hugging, right?

213
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,920
 And this is the moment,

214
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,480
 like my mouth is uncomfortably close to his ear, right?

215
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,320
 This is the moment where I could go,

216
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,560
 "Hey, buddy, I just wanna pass on a word,

217
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,920
 "maybe blah, blah, blah, you know,

218
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,560
 "Ezekiel 42, the river of God through your church."

219
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,400
 But I don't.

220
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,120
 And here's what I say, as I'm literally hugging this guy,

221
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,100
 "God, I'm not a prophet.

222
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,820
 "I don't move with the gift of prophecy.

223
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,760
 "That's not a gift that I generally have."

224
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,440
 And we embrace and then we let go

225
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,680
 and we both carry on worshiping

226
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,320
 as if nothing had happened at all.

227
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,680
 (congregation laughing)

228
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,520
 Well, that night, I get back to the hotel

229
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,040
 and I meet up with the rest of the Vine crew

230
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
 and I share with them the story.

231
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,000
 I'm like, "Oh, it's so funny."

232
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,160
 I was on my own and I had this word for this girl,

233
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
 you know, about her husband

234
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,440
 and this guy next to me about his church, you know?

235
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
 And I'm like, "I'm not a prophet,

236
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,040
 "so I just freaked out and I didn't say anything."

237
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,400
 And they're like, "Andrew, come on."

238
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,600
 And they're like, "Look, if you ever meet these guys,

239
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,840
 "ever again in the whole conference,

240
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,380
 "you have to tell them the words.

241
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,560
 "Promise us that you'll tell them the words."

242
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,400
 And I thought to myself,

243
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,000
 there's 30,000 people at this conference.

244
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
 There's 15,000 people in a stream that I'm not even in

245
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,480
 and I'm not supposed to be in that.

246
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,080
 And I'm like, "Yeah, sure, sure.

247
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,320
 "If I see them again, I'll totally tell them the word."

248
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,060
 Thinking I'm never going to see them again in my life, right?

249
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,120
 That night, I go to sleep

250
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,220
 and as I'm praying before I go to sleep,

251
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,960
 I say to God, "God, look, honestly,

252
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,980
 "if you give me the opportunity

253
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,300
 "to meet those two people again,

254
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,060
 "I will promise you I will share those words with them."

255
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,600
 Well, the next morning, Friday morning,

256
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,800
 I'm in the first session with all of us at the Vine.

257
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,400
 We're there and just before the session starts,

258
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,840
 I'm standing up and I'm scanning the 15,000 people

259
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
 in the auditorium.

260
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,740
 Now, I don't really remember what the young lady looked like

261
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,800
 but I remember what the Hell's Angel guy looked like, right?

262
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,900
 So I'm looking around trying to find Mr. Beard Guy

263
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,560
 with the leather jacket, right?

264
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,520
 And as I'm looking around, I kind of scan around

265
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,340
 and I get to and I notice suddenly,

266
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,620
 he's standing at the end of the row, staring right at me.

267
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,940
 He's literally standing at the end of the row

268
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,500
 and he's staring at me and he eyes me

269
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,140
 and he kind of like does a little nod

270
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,300
 and he starts to shimmy down the row

271
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,140
 whilst everybody else is like moving out the way, right?

272
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,980
 Shimmying down the row right towards me

273
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,940
 and he gets right up to me and before I can say anything,

274
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,220
 he goes this, he goes, "Mate," he's Australian, right?

275
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,940
 So, okay, I won't do the accent but anyway, he goes,

276
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,420
 he goes, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

277
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,460
 Damien, the Aussie's like, "Please don't, mate, don't,

278
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,580
 don't do the Aussie accent."

279
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:40,000
 I think I'm pretty good at it but anyway, we'll leave it.

280
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,580
 He's like, "Mate," he's like, "You probably

281
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,020
 don't remember me," and I'm like,

282
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,420
 (laughing)

283
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,580
 kind of remember you.

284
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,100
 He's like, "You probably don't remember me

285
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,700
 but we were sitting together

286
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,200
 at the main conference yesterday

287
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,940
 and I went to bed last night

288
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,900
 and God gave me a word for you

289
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,380
 and God gave me a word for you

290
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,500
 and I promised God that if I ever saw you

291
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,180
 in the conference again, I'd give you that word."

292
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,140
 And I'm like, "Dude, what is the word?"

293
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,980
 And he said, "God wants you to know that you're a prophet."

294
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,540
 (congregation laughing)

295
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,580
 Can you believe it?

296
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,140
 He's like, "God wants you to know that you're a prophet

297
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,340
 and that you should operate with the gift of prophecy."

298
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,140
 And I'm like, "Dude, sit down

299
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,540
 'cause I got a word for you," right?

300
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,740
 And I said, "You won't believe this

301
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,380
 but I had a word for you in our service yesterday

302
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,460
 in the session and I said to God,

303
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,580
 "I'm not a prophet."

304
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,700
 And he's like, "Well, what's the word?"

305
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,980
 And I said, "Okay, well, the word is this."

306
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,380
 And I started to kind of speak Ezekiel 42 over him.

307
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,440
 And I'm like, "God wants to move a spiritual revival

308
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,380
 in your church where it's like a river

309
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,960
 will flow out of your church."

310
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,460
 And he starts weeping and weeping.

311
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,340
 And I've never seen a guy like that

312
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,860
 just weeping and weeping.

313
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,820
 And he goes, "Man, you would have no idea."

314
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,540
 He said, "I'm a pastor of a small church

315
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,180
 about an hour and a half north of Sydney."

316
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,140
 And he said, "We've just purchased a building

317
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,820
 in the center of our little town

318
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,300
 and we've just built our little sanctuary."

319
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,140
 And he said, "Two weeks ago, our sanctuary is on a site

320
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,660
 that's over the main water pipe of the town.

321
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,100
 And two weeks ago, the water pipe burst

322
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,060
 and flooded our new church

323
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,420
 and all of the equipment inside was ruined."

324
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,460
 And he said, "It was like the worst experience

325
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,660
 that we've ever had."

326
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,140
 And I came to this conference going,

327
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,460
 "God, I need to know what future there is

328
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,860
 and we've lost all of our money and the equipment."

329
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,180
 And he said, "Now you've come and told me

330
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,140
 that this is a metaphor, a symbol,

331
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,260
 that there's a revival that's about to happen in my church.

332
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,300
 The water is gonna run out of our sanctuary

333
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,620
 like the spirit of God into our town."

334
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,540
 And he's like laughing and he's crying and I'm crying.

335
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,380
 And I'm thinking to myself,

336
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,060
 how amazing is God that he would do something like that?

337
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,620
 And I never saw the woman again.

338
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,220
 And I pray and believe that somebody else more faithful

339
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,220
 than I am gave her that word.

340
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,840
 And she understood that about her husband.

341
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,820
 But isn't it amazing that God besieges us?

342
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,660
 Like really pursues us.

343
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,260
 Like can orchestrate something out of 30,000 people

344
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,580
 so that I got to know something about myself

345
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,580
 that I needed to know that was on God's spirit for me.

346
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,620
 And that word has sustained me in 20 years of ministry.

347
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,220
 One of the things that I say to my staff now

348
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,580
 is I have two anointings, a shepherd and a prophet.

349
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,740
 Whereas back in 2003, I never would have said that.

350
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,860
 I needed something in my spirit

351
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,340
 to begin that part of my ministry development.

352
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,260
 This man needed something and God had both in his heart.

353
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,660
 And you need to know that God will pursue you.

354
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,180
 He loves you so much that he will orchestrate crazy things.

355
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,460
 And sometimes it'll happen in moments like that

356
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,220
 where it's a prophetic crazy thing.

357
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,380
 But other times he'll speak to you out of a movie.

358
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,540
 He'll speak to you out of a conversation

359
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,580
 with a friend over coffee.

360
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,860
 He'll speak to you because you're studying God's word.

361
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,180
 He'll come in a moment and it will come out of the blue

362
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,460
 or it'll be a conversation or something like that.

363
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,180
 And suddenly you'll know that God

364
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,140
 is trying to connect the dots for you.

365
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,620
 Sometimes it will happen sitting in a service like this.

366
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,620
 Sometimes it will happen sitting in a boardroom

367
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,060
 when you never expected, but he is pursuing you.

368
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,820
 And as David finishes Psalm 23

369
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,020
 with all this incredible imagery that he's given to us,

370
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:14,020
 he's like, I need them to know that God is pursuing.

371
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,160
 I wanna read you this from Psalm 23, verse six.

372
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,860
 Here's what David finishes the Psalm with.

373
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,420
 "Surely goodness and love will follow me

374
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,220
 "all the days of my life.

375
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,420
 "And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

376
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,020
 And I think David would say it this way also.

377
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,700
 "Surely goodness and love will follow you

378
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
 "all the days of your life.

379
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,880
 "And you will also dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

380
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,440
 "Surely goodness and love will follow us

381
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,160
 "all of the days of our lives.

382
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,560
 "And we together will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

383
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,680
 What a promise.

384
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,480
 And I want you to see how he starts this.

385
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,060
 He uses the most emphatic word

386
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,700
 that he uses throughout the whole of all of the verses.

387
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,680
 He starts with surely.

388
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,320
 Now this word surely, it's not often used in scripture

389
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,960
 and David doesn't use it in many other places,

390
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,360
 but he puts it here because surely literally translated

391
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,320
 means beyond a shadow of doubt.

392
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,480
 And he wants to start and say,

393
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,520
 I want you to know something about God.

394
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,560
 I want you to know something that God does

395
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,480
 that I have absolutely no doubt about,

396
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,920
 absolutely none at all.

397
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,560
 In fact, I will take this to the bank.

398
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,980
 I know for sure and for certain

399
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,560
 that these activities are what God does surely

400
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,080
 without a shadow of a doubt, he starts.

401
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,400
 And then at the end of the first verse

402
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,280
 or end of the first sentence, he then says this,

403
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,000
 "All the days of my life."

404
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
 He bookends the activity

405
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,160
 that he's about to tell them about with this,

406
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
 I have no doubt about it

407
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,960
 and that it happens every single day of my life.

408
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,040
 All the days of my life, the good days and the bad days,

409
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,120
 the days when I feel spiritual, the days when I'm in sin,

410
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,600
 the days when I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing,

411
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,640
 the days when I feel like I'm right in line with God,

412
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,680
 when I was young, when I'm old, it doesn't matter.

413
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,960
 Every single day of my life.

414
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,160
 Why is David saying that?

415
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,080
 'Cause he's about to tell us something

416
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,600
 that he has no doubt about that's not connected to him.

417
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,580
 All the days of my life,

418
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,800
 because it's not actually about me.

419
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,280
 Like what he's about to say is actually about God.

420
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,280
 And he goes, "I know emphatically without a doubt

421
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,560
 that God does these things every single day of my life,

422
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,920
 whether I feel it, whether I know it,

423
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,240
 whether I acknowledge it, He's still doing it."

424
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,400
 And he wants to almost tell his people the same thing.

425
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,360
 And I kind of feel my spirit today

426
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,640
 to wanna try and communicate this to you.

427
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,560
 No matter what is happening in your life,

428
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,320
 these two things God is doing for you.

429
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,040
 What are the two things?

430
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,120
 He says, "Goodness and love will follow me."

431
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,200
 Goodness and love, your goodness and love.

432
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,840
 David brings these two things together

433
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,240
 'cause it's really important that they come together.

434
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,640
 Let me explain quickly both.

435
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,620
 Goodness is the Hebrew word lob,

436
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,440
 and it literally means abundant blessing or lavish benefit.

437
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,800
 But when it's used predominantly in the Old Testament,

438
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,000
 it's used to speak about God's character and His nature.

439
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,280
 It's an attribute of God.

440
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,680
 And in particular, it's talking about God's holiness.

441
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,640
 When we say God is good, what we're doing is

442
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,960
 we're actually making a statement

443
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,000
 about His character and His nature.

444
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,520
 We're saying that He is holy.

445
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,400
 He is set apart.

446
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,840
 When we say God is good, we're defining something about Him.

447
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,140
 And here's what we're defining.

448
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,020
 We're defining that there's no evil in Him.

449
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,240
 There's no harm in Him.

450
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,500
 There's no anger in Him.

451
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,720
 There's no malice in Him.

452
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,800
 He's good and faithful and trustworthy

453
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,600
 that we can actually rely on Him.

454
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,120
 What we're saying when we declare that God is good

455
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,160
 is that He is different to us.

456
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,400
 The actual phrase of it actually has in mind

457
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,040
 Genesis 1 and 2, Adam and Eve in the garden.

458
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,280
 They got to experience the goodness of God

459
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,640
 before Genesis 3, when sin came into the world.

460
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,200
 In Genesis 1 and 2, God sets up the world

461
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,040
 as it was intended to be.

462
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,100
 The way it was supposed to be, shalom and peace.

463
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,520
 And God came and communed with Adam and Eve

464
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,480
 in the coolness of the night in the garden,

465
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
 and they could feel His shalom, His peace.

466
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,680
 That's His goodness.

467
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,780
 His goodness is the declaration

468
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,960
 that this is the way the world should be.

469
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,960
 His holiness, His goodness, His intention for the world.

470
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,000
 And what happened was in Genesis 3,

471
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,680
 everything now has been tainted by sin.

472
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,840
 Everything now, humanity and creation,

473
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,980
 now lives in the opposite of that.

474
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,520
 So when we say God is good,

475
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,360
 we're actually making a declaration,

476
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,320
 actually a prophetic statement,

477
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,800
 that God is different from this thing.

478
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,040
 This thing that's tarnished and hurting and broken.

479
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,080
 His goodness sets apart from that.

480
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,200
 Now this is really important, church,

481
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,740
 because very often when we as Christians understand

482
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,680
 or use the term goodness,

483
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,040
 we normally connect it to something happening in our lives.

484
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,260
 Let me be honest about this.

485
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,140
 We often will say, God is good, I got my promotion.

486
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,360
 Or we'll say, God is good,

487
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,440
 my relationships are going well right now.

488
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,420
 God is good, I made a lot of money this month on sales.

489
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,920
 God is good because my health is good.

490
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,240
 In other words, we define God's goodness

491
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,100
 by something that's happening for benefit in our lives.

492
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,160
 Are you with me?

493
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,600
 We gotta be really careful.

494
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,760
 That's not what David is setting up here.

495
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,360
 This is why we actually can say that phrase,

496
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,660
 God is good, all the time.

497
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,240
 The cheesiest Christian phrase ever.

498
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,680
 I remember growing up, hearing that phrase,

499
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,560
 thinking to myself, I can't say that

500
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,040
 because there's so much in my life that doesn't feel good.

501
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,000
 There's so much in my life that's broken.

502
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,160
 There's so much in my life that's pain.

503
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,520
 How can I say God is good all the time

504
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,640
 'cause I don't feel it?

505
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,800
 And David's saying, it's not about what you feel,

506
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,280
 it's about who God is.

507
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,760
 God can be good all the time

508
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,280
 because his goodness is not related

509
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,360
 to whether you feel like he's being good.

510
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,880
 His goodness is not related

511
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,000
 to whether there's some benefit

512
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,120
 that's happening in your life.

513
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,760
 He's just plainly set apart as good.

514
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,400
 So a few weeks ago, when I told you

515
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,280
 that I spent those six hours by my father's deathbed,

516
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,840
 the worst six hours of my life,

517
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,300
 the most horrible, darkest valley I've ever been in,

518
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,200
 God was still good in that moment.

519
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,740
 When my wife and I discovered

520
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,460
 we couldn't have our own biological children.

521
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
 When I discovered that I was infertile

522
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,140
 and unable to father children

523
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,280
 and my dreams for being a biological father

524
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,220
 were torn to shreds, God was still good.

525
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,280
 When that man had that thing happen in his church

526
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,860
 and the pipe burst and everything flooded

527
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,180
 and all his equipment was ruined, God was still good.

528
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,020
 Because when we say God is good,

529
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,140
 we're defining an attribute of him

530
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,300
 rather than our experience of it.

531
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,100
 We may not always feel he's good.

532
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,460
 We may not always know that he's good

533
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,220
 and tangibly we might feel like the opposite is true.

534
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
 And David's saying, you need to understand

535
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,000
 his goodness is absolutely separated

536
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,260
 from your experience.

537
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,280
 Are you with me?

538
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,980
 Now, if that was all he was saying,

539
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,980
 that would be kind of weird

540
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,220
 because that's kind of like some theological concept

541
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,220
 and how does that then become a reality for us?

542
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,260
 That's why he says, goodness and love.

543
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,260
 Love here is the Hebrew word chesed.

544
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,580
 And chesed means literally,

545
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,860
 it means loving kindness or loving faithfulness.

546
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,120
 See, the chesed of God is the idea of his grace

547
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,220
 and his forgiveness and his unfailing love to humanity.

548
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,600
 This word was first used and described about God

549
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,140
 at Mount Sinai, where God comes down

550
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,400
 to a newly freed people out of their slavery.

551
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,920
 And God says, I need to define for you who I am

552
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
 and I need you to understand who you are.

553
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,700
 I will write this day, say,

554
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,320
 I am covenanting my love to you.

555
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,520
 I will never leave you.

556
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,800
 I will never forsake you.

557
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,400
 I'll never remove my love from you.

558
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,720
 It is my chesed.

559
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,280
 It is loving kindness, loving faithfulness.

560
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,600
 You can absolutely bank on it and it will forgive all sin.

561
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,640
 It will remove you from your pressures.

562
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,280
 It will take you into a better life.

563
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
 It'll bring you into relationship with me.

564
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,280
 See, his goodness is true, but without his love,

565
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,120
 we will be naturally separated from his holiness.

566
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,680
 It's his chesed that brings us into his goodness.

567
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,800
 Are you with me, church?

568
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,440
 'Cause you can't get into that goodness

569
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
 'cause you're separated from it.

570
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,160
 Sin taints you from the goodness of God.

571
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,960
 So it's goodness and love,

572
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,840
 because the love is the thing that purchase for you

573
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,160
 your ability to be restored in relationship with him.

574
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,560
 And he's saying, do you see this?

575
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,560
 See, it's my goodness that leads you to repentance.

576
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,080
 It is my love that restores you out of your brokenness.

577
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,620
 It's my goodness that is like the prodigal son

578
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,440
 picking himself up from the muck of the pigsty

579
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,160
 and saying, surely it was better in my father's house.

580
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,800
 It's love, that's the father picking up his robe

581
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,640
 and running in the field

582
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,960
 to embrace the returning protocol.

583
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,000
 These two things must sit together.

584
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,960
 God's goodness that's separate from our experience

585
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,220
 and his love that defines our experience in him.

586
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,720
 Goodness and love must come together.

587
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,320
 Is this helpful?

588
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,160
 Now, this is the bit that blows my mind.

589
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,280
 Then David says, these two things will follow me.

590
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
 The attributes of God's goodness, his holiness,

591
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,240
 his purity, his set apartness, and his love

592
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,520
 that forgives me and restores me and renews me

593
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,400
 and brings me back into relationship with him.

594
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,040
 These two things will follow after me.

595
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,840
 The word follow there is the Hebrew word radap,

596
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,980
 and it literally means to chase, to be pursued,

597
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,360
 to be hunted down.

598
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,080
 It's imagery of a hunter hunting something.

599
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,680
 And I know that imagery is a bit strange

600
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,440
 'cause God's not out to kill us, right?

601
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
 But he is out to find us.

602
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,760
 He's out to sort us out.

603
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,080
 He leaves the 99 and goes and picks up that one sheep.

604
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,200
 He tells a pastor from Hong Kong

605
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,440
 about some crazy Ezekiel 42 thing

606
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
 so that a pastor north of Sydney

607
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,120
 can know that everything's gonna be all right.

608
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,040
 He's a God who hunts us, pursues us, and has a word for us

609
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,320
 'cause he wants goodness and love to be with us.

610
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,440
 It's following, pursuing after us.

611
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,780
 Whatever's going on in your life right now,

612
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,080
 God is pursuing and he's after you.

613
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,600
 And I just love this 'cause it blows my mind

614
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,640
 because this seems to contradict everything

615
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,000
 that David has been telling us so far in the Psalm.

616
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,600
 Because in the imagery of the first four verses,

617
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,080
 it was about God as a shepherd and us following him,

618
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,400
 wasn't it?

619
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,240
 It was about God being out front

620
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,640
 and we as his sheep follow after him.

621
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,720
 And he provides and he protects and he guides us.

622
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,760
 And he spent four verses trying to help us understand

623
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,440
 that we have a leader, but that we need to follow him,

624
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,320
 that he's walking ahead of us

625
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,160
 and we need to follow in his footsteps

626
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,880
 and that he'll take us to green pastures,

627
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,560
 he'll take us to dark valleys, he'll restore our soul,

628
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,680
 but only if we follow after him.

629
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,380
 So is David now contradicting himself

630
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,040
 when he says God is following after us?

631
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,760
 Actually, David's not contradicting himself.

632
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,040
 He's actually completing the picture.

633
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,180
 He's saying, here's the amazing thing about God.

634
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,520
 Not only do you have a shepherd who's ahead of you

635
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,200
 that you're supposed to follow, but as you follow him,

636
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,360
 he then comes on your rear guard and he follows you.

637
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,280
 He's following you with his goodness, his purity,

638
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,560
 his holiness, his set apartness, and his love,

639
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,200
 which perches you back into a relationship with him

640
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,480
 so that you can know goodness and purity and hope again.

641
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,840
 And he, as you follow him, he's following you

642
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,320
 and you follow him and he's following you.

643
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,200
 And it's like this perfect picture

644
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,500
 of what it means to be surrounded by the love of a God

645
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,460
 who doesn't give up on you.

646
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,780
 And I love this, it blows my mind

647
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,420
 that right at the end of the Psalm,

648
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,100
 he wants to complete this idea

649
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,020
 that you are surrounded by God.

650
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,900
 If you wanna be a non-anxious presence

651
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,500
 in the chaos of this world, you need to understand

652
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,460
 that you're not just got a God

653
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,660
 that you're supposed to follow

654
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,220
 and wondering what's going on behind you,

655
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,180
 you've got a God who surrounds you.

656
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,220
 I pulled all this together

657
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,540
 in a kind of a funky, very basic diagram.

658
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,080
 Let me show you this basic diagram

659
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,120
 that I came up with this week.

660
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
 There you go.

661
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,640
 There's you in the middle and you're following God.

662
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,240
 God is leading your life.

663
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,480
 And in that, we saw in the first four verses,

664
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,880
 provision, protection, and guidance,

665
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,880
 but also God is pursuing your life

666
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,440
 with goodness and mercy and loving kindness.

667
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,440
 And David's saying, if you see all of this,

668
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,720
 this is Psalm 23, verses one all the way to six.

669
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,880
 If you see this,

670
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,920
 then you will be that non-anxious presence.

671
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,000
 You will be like, oh man,

672
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
 I've got a God who's all around me.

673
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,120
 I've got a God who's in front of me and behind me.

674
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,800
 And guess what he says in verse four.

675
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,960
 He says, when you go through the valley of the shadow death,

676
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,720
 I am with you.

677
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,000
 So I got one who's, I got a God who's in front of me.

678
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,240
 I got a God who's behind me

679
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,760
 and I got a God who's right alongside of me.

680
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,280
 Like he's everywhere.

681
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,400
 And when I get my head around the reality

682
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,640
 that I exist in the bubble of God's goodness

683
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,000
 and protection and mercy and kindness and love,

684
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,840
 I can begin to say, bring it on.

685
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,400
 Like what can happen?

686
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
 Like I will fear no evil.

687
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,480
 I will be released from my anxiety.

688
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,760
 I will find myself in a place where yes,

689
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,040
 stuff may still happen.

690
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,320
 Things might go wrong.

691
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,120
 There might be those hospital bed moments.

692
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,040
 There might be the destruction of the sanctuary

693
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,100
 by a burst water pipe.

694
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,080
 Those stuff's gonna happen in life.

695
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,320
 But my starting point, my middle point and my end point

696
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,160
 is that I have Jesus who is the Alpha and the Omega.

697
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,840
 If he's in front of me and he's behind me,

698
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,640
 he's got everything else sorted out in the middle

699
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,080
 and I can go, ah.

700
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,400
 And when I go, ah,

701
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,600
 everybody else around me goes, huh?

702
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,040
 (congregation laughing)

703
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,040
 And in that, in that, we get to share the gospel.

704
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,400
 But if we don't believe this,

705
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,920
 then when the storms come and the rains come

706
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,720
 and the hospital bed happens and the burst pipes happen,

707
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,800
 what testimony are we bringing to a world

708
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,720
 that desperately needs one?

709
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,360
 How are we actually saying anything about who Jesus is?

710
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,720
 If we're being pushed around and tossed back and forth

711
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,280
 by every wave of everything.

712
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,720
 Now there's something beautiful

713
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,520
 about what David's trying to communicate to us here.

714
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,200
 That there's another way to live.

715
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,640
 Not only that, there's another place to live.

716
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,200
 Notice what he says right at the end.

717
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,440
 I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

718
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,800
 The word dwell here means to be rooted down,

719
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,880
 to set down, to rest down, to put roots in.

720
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,920
 It's the idea of making a home.

721
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,080
 And it's really interesting 'cause he says, I make a home.

722
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,920
 And it's translated here in English,

723
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,800
 in the house of the Lord.

724
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,400
 The house, whenever we hear the phrase,

725
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,520
 the house of the Lord, we always think of church.

726
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,920
 Because in the Old Testament,

727
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,840
 when that phrase is generally used, the house of the Lord,

728
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,400
 it was meaning the temple.

729
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,360
 In fact, the temple was known as the house of the Lord.

730
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,200
 But what you have to understand as David is writing Psalm 23,

731
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,600
 the temple's not built for another 15 years or so.

732
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,400
 It's actually his son that will build the temple, not him.

733
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,080
 So when he says here, the house of the Lord,

734
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,880
 he's actually not thinking about the temple

735
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,080
 or some building.

736
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,440
 In fact, the Hebrew word means the dwelling place.

737
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,640
 So you can understand like this,

738
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,600
 David is literally finishing the Psalm like this.

739
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,840
 I will dwell in the dwelling place of the Lord.

740
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,760
 And where is the dwelling place of the Lord?

741
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,000
 He's just told us.

742
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,840
 It's in front of us, it's with us,

743
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,880
 it's behind us, it's all around us.

744
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,080
 I will put my roots down in the presence of God.

745
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,400
 Presence of God is not defined to a church service.

746
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,800
 It's not defined to a building.

747
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,880
 It's not defined to anything.

748
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
 I can find the presence of God,

749
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,280
 His dwelling place in my boardroom, in my classroom,

750
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,560
 in my relationships, in my home,

751
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,840
 and yes, hopefully in my church.

752
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,000
 He's basically saying God is everywhere with us

753
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,520
 if we follow Him and have the belief,

754
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,300
 surely, without a doubt,

755
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,120
 that He's following us with forgiveness

756
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,680
 and mercy and His holiness.

757
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,040
 When He's protecting us,

758
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,380
 we can find His dwelling place

759
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,840
 wherever it is that we find ourselves.

760
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,240
 We dwell in His dwelling place.

761
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,080
 It's not until the New Testament that we get the idea

762
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,280
 that Jesus becomes the dwelling place,

763
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,080
 that Jesus decides to come down to us,

764
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,440
 take on humanity in its beautiful, most purest form,

765
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,080
 fully God, fully human, tabernacling, being one.

766
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,040
 And we look to Jesus.

767
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,880
 This is why Jesus says,

768
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,480
 "If you are weary and burdened, come to me

769
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,700
 and I'll give you rest."

770
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,860
 Rest, our home, the presence of God,

771
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,440
 is not defined to a certain areas of the world.

772
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,200
 This world is His dwelling place.

773
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,840
 And so when you're in your businesses

774
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,820
 and you're doing your work and you're in your homes

775
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,740
 and you're living your life, God's as much there.

776
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,460
 That is as much His house as this place

777
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,800
 for 90 minutes on a Sunday.

778
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,480
 And he's saying, David's saying, "I will dwell.

779
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,880
 I'll put my roots down everywhere where God is

780
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,920
 because where He is, I'm at home."

781
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,260
 That's Psalm 23.

782
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,800
 That's what it means to be a non-anxious presence

783
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,240
 in the carelessness world.

784
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,560
 I've got like one minute left.

785
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,280
 Here's what I'm gonna do for you.

786
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,340
 'Cause this is the last of the series.

787
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,660
 I'm gonna pull together, we've done this for six weeks.

788
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,940
 I'm gonna pull together on one slide,

789
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,320
 all six things that define what it means

790
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,840
 to be a non-anxious presence.

791
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,620
 Now, they're gonna come up one by one.

792
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,080
 Don't take a photo too early.

793
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,280
 But when we get to the end of it,

794
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,400
 I highly recommend you take a photo of it.

795
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,000
 Like honestly, 'cause I wanna say this before I finish.

796
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,400
 This sermon series is not about some teaching on a Sunday

797
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,360
 and some feeling in a room.

798
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,520
 If you really want to walk this out,

799
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,360
 I truly believe God wants you to be a non-anxious presence

800
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,680
 in your workplace, in your family, wherever it is.

801
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,160
 Then you need to take this slide in a moment

802
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,760
 and you need to actually put your own work into it.

803
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,560
 What does this mean for me?

804
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,640
 How do I live this out now?

805
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,320
 How do I put steps to what we've been hearing each week?

806
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,600
 I've heard some great things,

807
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,880
 but what does that truly mean for me?

808
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,640
 And in our community groups that we have here at the Vine,

809
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,920
 in your friendship groups,

810
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,800
 in your own personal devotional time,

811
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,560
 to take these six things and ask the hard questions

812
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,440
 between you and God and allow Him to change you.

813
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
 So here are the things.

814
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,520
 Here's my summary of Psalm 23

815
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,840
 and all that we've been doing.

816
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,440
 This is what it means to be a non-anxious presence.

817
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,000
 We need to have the courage to let go

818
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,400
 of our tendency to take control of our world

819
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,480
 and invite God to be God again.

820
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,880
 That's Psalm 46, 10.

821
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,960
 That was six weeks ago

822
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,200
 when we started the series with Psalm 46.

823
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,680
 We need to walk in the conviction that in God,

824
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,320
 we have everything we truly need

825
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,360
 and we lack no good thing.

826
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,680
 That was the first week of our Psalm 23.

827
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,080
 We need to stop thinking of God as the GPS of our lives

828
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,400
 and accept that He is calling us to follow Him

829
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,040
 wherever He desires to lead us.

830
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,440
 Verses two and three.

831
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,280
 We need to remember that sometimes the path God leads us on

832
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,280
 purposely takes us through a darkened valley

833
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,000
 to reveal to us part of His nature

834
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,720
 we could not discover in any other place.

835
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,000
 Verse four.

836
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,960
 We need to understand that true community

837
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,040
 is birthed in the labor pains of reconciliation and love.

838
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,720
 And the restoration of our broken relationships

839
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,600
 is central to our flourishing.

840
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,520
 Verse five.

841
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,000
 And finally today, we need to rest in the knowledge

842
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,280
 that God always pursues us with His goodness and His love

843
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,400
 and invites us to find our home in His presence

844
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,880
 amid the chaos of this world.

845
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,160
 Take a photo of that.

846
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:57,400
 But don't just take a photo of it.

847
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,120
 My prayer for you as we finish the series

848
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,400
 is that that will be life to you,

849
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,200
 that you'll refer to that many times throughout your life,

850
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,360
 that Psalm 23 will continue to be a guide to you

851
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,840
 as you find yourself more and more at peace with Him.

852
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,760
 Would you stand with me?

853
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,960
 And I wanna pray for us.

854
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:21,680
 Father, we just are so grateful.

855
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,480
 So grateful for our community together.

856
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,040
 We're so grateful for this Psalm

857
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,880
 that has powerfully shaken us, challenged us,

858
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,400
 encouraged us, inspired us.

859
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,640
 Father, we're thankful that you are present

860
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,480
 in this moment, in this room with us.

861
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,800
 I wanna encourage you

862
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,920
 as we finish our time together in this series.

863
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,760
 As a leadership here,

864
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,320
 we want to now seal this work that God is going to do,

865
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,520
 has done through the series,

866
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,680
 but is going to do as we progress.

867
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,640
 And we wanna, as a leadership,

868
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,720
 sort of speak that over you,

869
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,080
 sort of conceal in you a promise of Scripture.

870
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,000
 And so in a moment,

871
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,040
 Emma's gonna sing a Scripture over you.

872
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,480
 And it will be one that's familiar to you.

873
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,180
 I wanna encourage you not to sing.

874
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,160
 And I want you just to allow Emma and the team

875
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,720
 to declare something over you from Scripture.

876
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,920
 And as they do that,

877
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,440
 I want you just to receive this promise.

878
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,800
 Because this promise really summarizes so much

879
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,880
 of a God who pursues us and hunts us down,

880
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,600
 who loves us and is good.

881
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,680
 And a God that's here for you right now,

882
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,240
 whatever is going on in your life.

883
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,040
 So can I encourage you, if you're comfortable,

884
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,360
 just to open your hands,

885
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,960
 just to quieten your spirit.

886
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,680
 If you're online right now, same for you.

887
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,040
 Just open your hands, quieten your spirit down.

888
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,200
 Resist the temptation to sing.

889
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,760
 And allow us to pray over you with song.

890
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,760
 And I pray that this will be a great blessing to you.

891
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,340
 (gentle music)

892
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,700
