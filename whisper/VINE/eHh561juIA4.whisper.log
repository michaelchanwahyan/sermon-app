[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   Thank you, Ivan.
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.920]   Do I-- is this here OK?
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.760]   OK.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.200]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.920]   My name is Justin.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.360]   I'm one of the pastors at the Vine Wan Chai,
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.160]   but I've been here a couple of times.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.280]   I was here three weeks ago.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.840]   My wife Patsy here.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.520]   We're here together with our children.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.160]   So thank you for having us.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.440]   Thank you, Tim, for having us.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.160]   Wherever you are, I know you're watching.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.040]   Just want to say hi to you and Chris and Elle.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.840]   Hopefully, you're having a good time.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.140]   We miss you.
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.440]   And so yeah, before we start, I would like to pray for us.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.120]   So I'm just going to pray again.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.880]   Not saying that you're praying.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.560]   But anyways, I just want to pray for us
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.680]   to receive today's word.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.400]   So would you pray with me?
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.880]   Lord, we ask you to give us a humble heart, a listening
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.680]   heart, a receptive heart this morning.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.760]   Father, I know all of us are going
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.840]   through different seasons.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.140]   We're going through different obstacles.
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.800]   We're going through different things in our lives
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.360]   where holding and juggling different things.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.120]   And so Lord, you know that.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.680]   And so we just ask you to speak a specific word to each of us
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.040]   here tonight, today, this morning.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.600]   Father, in your name we pray.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.720]   Amen.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.320]   So I found this out this week.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.080]   My friend told me that Yuen Long used to be and still is
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.200]   a very rich land for farming.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.000]   And I know for those of us who live in Yuen Long,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.960]   we work in Yuen Long.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.120]   This is a specialty, especially before the 1980s.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.600]   There were so many plots of vegetable land.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.840]   There were grains of rice.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.720]   And this rice and the grain would
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.840]   feed Yuen Long, the people of Yuen Long,
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.440]   but also the people of Hong Kong.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   And so I bring this up not just as a trivial, interesting fact,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.600]   but I bring this up because it's profound for us today
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.840]   to worship together knowing that we
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.880]   sit on a historically rich land for farming.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.160]   And today we are going to talk about farming.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.480]   We're talking about the parable of the sower, the seeds,
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.000]   and the soil.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.320]   And I titled today's message, A Parable on Grace and Listening.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.040]   So right now, I just want to ask you to read with me.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.520]   I'm going to read Mark chapter 4, verse 1 to 20.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.080]   So I ask you to follow along with me.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.960]   Verse 1, "Again, Jesus began to teach by the sea.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.760]   And such a very large crowd gathered to him
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.400]   that he got into a boat on the sea and sat down.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.640]   And the whole crowd was by the sea on the land.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.400]   And he was teaching the many things in parables
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.120]   and was saying to them in his teaching, listen to this.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.200]   Behold, the sower went out to sow.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.640]   As he was sowing, some seed fell beside the road,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.160]   and the birds came and ate it up.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.720]   Other seed fell on the rocky ground
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.760]   where it did not have much soil.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.120]   And immediately it sprang up because it
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.880]   had no depth of soil.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.640]   And when the sun had risen, it was scorched.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.400]   And because it had no root, it withered away.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.400]   Other seed fell among the thorns,
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.440]   and the thorns came up and choked it,
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.560]   and it yielded no crop.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.200]   Other seeds fell into the good soil.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.320]   And as they grew up and increased,
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.400]   they yielded a crop and produced 30, 60,
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.840]   and 100 times as much.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.400]   And he was saying, he who has ears to hear, let him hear.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.220]   Verse 10.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.400]   As soon as Jesus was alone, his followers,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.000]   along with the 12 disciples,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.720]   began asking him about the parables.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.840]   And he was saying to them, to you has been given
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.040]   the mystery of the kingdom of God.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.060]   But for those who are outside, everything comes in parables.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.600]   So that while seeing, they may see, and not perceive.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.920]   And while hearing, they may hear and not understand.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.800]   Otherwise, they might return,
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.360]   and it would be forgiven them.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.560]   Verse 13.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.400]   And Jesus said to them, do you not understand this parable?
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.160]   How will you understand all the parables?
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.200]   The sower sows the word.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.440]   These are the ones who are beside the road
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.800]   where the word is sown.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.500]   And when they hear, immediately Satan comes
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.540]   and takes away the word which had been sown in them.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.260]   And in a similar way, these are the ones
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.660]   sown with seed on the rocky places,
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.100]   who when they hear the word,
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.180]   immediately receive it with joy,
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.460]   and yet they have no firm rooting in themselves,
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.420]   but are only temporary.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.200]   Then when affliction or persecution occurs
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.300]   because of the word, immediately they fall away.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.280]   Verse 18.
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.820]   And others are the ones sown with seed among the thorns.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.060]   These are the ones who have heard the word,
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.460]   but the worries of the world,
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.460]   and the deceitfulness of wealth,
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.300]   and the desires for other things
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.400]   enter and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.900]   And those are the ones sown with seed on the good soil,
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.840]   and they hear the word and accept it,
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.040]   and bear fruit 30, 60, and 100 times as much.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.440]   So this passage may be familiar to many of us.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.660]   We've maybe heard it many times,
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.460]   but this morning I ask,
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.540]   no matter how many times you've heard this,
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.700]   Jesus begins and ends this parable
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.220]   with a very profound and straightforward command.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.980]   He says, "Listen, church, listen to what I have to say.
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.100]   "I want you to listen and hear
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.700]   "what I'm trying to say to you."
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.740]   Because I do personally believe
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.700]   there's something inherently important
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.380]   he wants to get us to hear.
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.460]   But before we jump into today's sermon,
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.780]   I want to ask you,
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.340]   when was the last time you heard Jesus speak to you?
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.560]   I want you just to think about the last time.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.900]   It could have been this morning,
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.540]   it could have been this week,
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.260]   it could have been years ago,
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.180]   it could have been, actually, I don't know.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.700]   And I want you to think,
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.620]   what did it mean to you that Jesus would speak to you?
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.020]   The word that you received, what was that like?
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.000]   Where were you?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.380]   What place in your life did Jesus speak to you
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.140]   and you just thought, wow?
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.440]   I want you to hold this because I know
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.260]   the basis of many of our lives.
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.580]   We, professionally or personally,
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.780]   we do a lot of listening.
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.980]   And I think a lot of us, naturally,
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.260]   we listen when we find something important
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.620]   or something that's worth listening to.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.500]   And as I was thinking about this for myself,
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.980]   I remember one time, I think I heard God.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.740]   It sounded like God, certainly.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.580]   It matched with scripture.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.060]   My friends and family also said,
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.380]   yeah, this is perhaps God.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.140]   And I decided that, you know what?
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.800]   I'm gonna listen to this, I'm gonna lean in,
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.220]   I'm gonna respond.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.620]   I'm just gonna live this out.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.900]   And here I am, 14 years later, as a pastor at the Vine.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.540]   And that was a time when, in faith,
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.460]   it could have been God, maybe it wasn't God, I don't know.
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.580]   But I trusted it was God.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.200]   Now, this morning, I'm saying,
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.660]   I really actually believe that every opportunity
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.380]   we have to listen can change our life.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.100]   Maybe not in such a radical way that I'm talking about,
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.100]   but every word has the potential
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.160]   to change the course of our heart.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160]   So that's why today I want you to listen.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.960]   And I chose today's passage for a very specific reason,
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.740]   because this passage calls us to seriously reflect
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.780]   on our state of listening.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.720]   Are we good listeners?
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.520]   'Cause I think a lot of times, I'm a terrible listener.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.380]   I'm a bad listener.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.860]   But I know I can also be a better listener.
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.720]   And so in this parable, listening is equated
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.920]   to receptivity to God's word.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.320]   It's being able to take God's word,
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.820]   to take it seriously, and to contemplate
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.660]   what is God saying to us.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.440]   And so this parable, therefore,
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.640]   calls us to reflect this morning
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.760]   on our ability to listen to God
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.000]   in a way that builds our intimacy with God.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.940]   Because I know this is our theme this year
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.360]   across the two Vine churches.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.700]   And so I want us to reflect on our state of listening,
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.360]   how we listen to God this morning.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.100]   So I'm gonna break it down this morning.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.360]   I'm gonna give you some context for this passage.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.440]   I'm gonna go into detail about what this passage
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.500]   is talking about, what Jesus is talking about.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.240]   And I wanna end this message to share on,
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.320]   for us to reflect on God's grace for us.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.160]   Is that okay?
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.960]   All right.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.040]   So some context for this passage.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.820]   In verse one to two, Jesus, as we read,
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.360]   is already in a boat by the shore.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.960]   He's teaching a large crowd about God's kingdom.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.760]   And everything about God and who he is
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.160]   and the mysteries of God's kingdom.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.760]   In verses three to nine, Jesus tells us this parable
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.960]   about a farmer sowing seeds and what happens to these seeds.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.960]   In verse 13 to 20, Jesus privately explains this parable
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.740]   to his disciples and other people
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.480]   that were around listening.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.400]   And so the imagery of this parable
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.240]   of a farmer sowing seeds would have been very familiar
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.260]   to first century Christians, especially the farmers
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.880]   that were in the crowd listening to Jesus.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.140]   They would have understood just the whole process
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.540]   of what it meant to sow seeds and to the hard work
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.240]   that took to protecting the seed,
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.800]   making sure the seed germinates, watering,
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   protecting the crops from the elements
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.660]   and making sure that at the end of the season
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.720]   that there would be yield, there would be a harvest.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.300]   And it was, I can't even imagine being a farmer,
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.400]   but here we are.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.160]   And so there's a few characters,
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.760]   main characters in this parable.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.260]   And it is the sower, the seeds, and the soil.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.200]   So the sower, of course, is the Father,
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.180]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.660]   Or the sower could be any Christian
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.060]   that preaches God's word concerning Jesus and God's kingdom.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.900]   The seeds in this parable, the second character,
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.320]   is God's word or the gospel about Jesus.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.140]   And lastly, the soil.
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.900]   I thought long and hard about this,
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.600]   but the soil, I think today, I want us to think about it
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   as conditions for bad listening and for good listening.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.160]   So that's what the soil represents,
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.020]   conditions for bad and good listening.
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.940]   Now, I don't think they're permanent states,
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.620]   but I think they're situations and seasons
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.160]   that we find ourselves in,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.280]   and we can easily move from a season of bad listening
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.720]   to a season of, oh, I can hear something.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.960]   You know, I can perceive something.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.180]   Church, at the heart of what Jesus is teaching about today
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.840]   in this parable sits a discipleship issue.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.380]   Discipleship is a fancy word for our journey with Jesus.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.420]   Discipleship is a process where day in, day out,
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.780]   we learn to pray, we learn to be with God,
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.780]   we learn to worship together,
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.660]   we learn to wrestle with God's word,
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.280]   and we learn to grow in the midst of troubles,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.660]   persecutions, afflictions, heartaches, suffering.
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.300]   And so what Jesus is teaching us today
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.380]   is what happens when we follow him
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.800]   and the process of how we can grow as disciples.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:53.280]   Jesus wants us to know, and I want you to know,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.340]   that being his disciples is extremely difficult,
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.740]   and I think you already know that.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.800]   It is challenging, it is difficult.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.640]   Why?
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.660]   Because we will always encounter barriers and obstacles
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.740]   that prevent us from being with him.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.240]   And as Christians, as I said,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.440]   we will go through seasons where we grow, we flourish,
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.020]   we just are so excited.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.900]   We wake up and we want to be in God's word,
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.860]   we want to talk about God's word.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.640]   But at the same time, we also go in seasons
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.680]   where it's so difficult to hear God's word.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.760]   It's difficult because I don't want to hear God's word.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.480]   You know, it's difficult for the circumstances
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.040]   and the obstacles that we're going through,
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.060]   but sometimes we are unable to grow,
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.880]   we're unable to hear God's word,
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.280]   is what this parable wants to teach us about.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.280]   And the last thing I want to say about context
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.300]   is that I think today it's helpful for us
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.520]   to think about our Christian growth,
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.040]   our discipleship process, that is dependent on two things.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.800]   One, our growth is dependent on the sower.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.400]   It's dependent on God's grace.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.120]   It's God's grace and his sovereignty and his love for us
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.160]   and the church that we grow.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.120]   And the second thing, we grow because of our own effort,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.560]   our willingness to hear God's word,
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.280]   our willingness to really trust that the living God
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.840]   wants to speak to me and wants to speak to us today.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.160]   And so it's healthy to think about both
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.420]   as we listen to this parable.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.640]   Okay, are you guys ready?
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.620]   We're gonna go into detail
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.200]   on what this parable is speaking about.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.120]   So in this parable, this farmer,
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.240]   he is sowing four batches of seed into the ground.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.280]   And each batch, it's actually the same seed.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:51.280]   It falls on four different types of soil conditions.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.660]   And so right now, I want to explain to you
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.780]   what each soil condition represents
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.360]   according to this passage.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.400]   And I also want to speak about what obstacles and barriers
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.800]   each batch of seed represents
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.420]   and what happens as a result, okay?
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.280]   So the first soil condition is those seeds
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.680]   that fall along the path.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.920]   And so in verse three and four,
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.040]   the seeds fall beside the path where the birds come in
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.460]   and immediately, they eat up all the seeds.
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.000]   And in verse 15, Jesus, when explaining to his disciples,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.560]   he says that when the word is preached and heard,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.360]   Satan immediately comes in and takes away what was sown
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.600]   so that there's no chance for the seed to germinate.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.440]   So the first obstacle is, in fact, Satan,
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.000]   who's aggressive and who's so hostile
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.880]   to any potential disciple to,
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.520]   basically, Satan does not want anyone to hear God's word.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.840]   So therefore, he comes and plucks away God's word.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.080]   And so while we should not cower and live in fear,
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.000]   I think it's wise and prudent, though,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.160]   to remember that, yes, there are forces of evil
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.160]   that are against us, that resist God's word,
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.660]   that resist us from hearing God's word.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.680]   And this is a reality that we live in.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.040]   And I don't know about you,
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.360]   but this happens to me all the time.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.240]   Every time we hear an encouragement,
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.440]   something amazing happens in our hearts
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.200]   that we attribute to God,
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.300]   then immediately, Satan comes in and whispers something,
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.280]   and we're reminded of a fear.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.560]   We start doubting, is this really God?
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.400]   Maybe it's not even God.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.120]   Every week, when I'm servicely,
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.720]   when I'm with you guys, this happens.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.180]   And I think, really, we just have to remember
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.320]   that not to be scared, but to know that,
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.500]   at times, Satan does, it directly,
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.220]   want to take away and steal away
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.980]   what God is wanting to give us.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.340]   So the second soil condition is the rocky road.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.880]   So in this soil condition, in verses five to six,
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.340]   after scattering the seed,
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.520]   the seeds immediately spring up
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.380]   because it says in scripture
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.040]   that they have no depth in the soil.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.540]   And when the scorching sun comes up,
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.740]   this little seed that sprouted,
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.780]   it withers because it had no rooting.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.000]   It had no deep rooting in the soil.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.420]   And when Jesus was explaining this to his disciples
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.740]   in verse 16 and 17, Jesus says,
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.740]   "These are the people who hear God's word,
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.260]   "and immediately, they receive it with joy."
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.300]   They are so excited that God is speaking to them.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.860]   But their joy is short-lived
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.900]   because when the sun comes up,
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.940]   when persecution comes, when trouble comes,
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.100]   on account of the word, these listeners fall away.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.220]   So the second obstacle is trouble.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.040]   It's suffering.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.060]   It's hard times.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:49.980]   It's persecution.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.380]   And it's going through these
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.320]   that causes disciples to fall away.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.660]   Now, I wanna explain falling away.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.060]   Once again, it's not a permanent state,
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.820]   but falling away, I think,
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.640]   describes an inability to follow Christ in that moment.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:11.000]   And so we all encounter these moments where we're unable.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.880]   We are unable to sustain a closeness,
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.280]   an intimacy with God,
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.920]   and that's what this soil represents.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.520]   And once again, I want to remind us this is normal.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.080]   This is not an abnormal,
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.480]   like this only happens to 10 or 5% of us.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.720]   This is a fact of our daily lives.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.180]   And historically, this was a very common problem,
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.840]   a common reality for the early church
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.380]   because being persecuted was synonymous
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.320]   with being a Christian back in the first century.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.760]   A lot of Christians, they remained faithful to God
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.780]   even onto death, and we called them martyrs.
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.860]   They were willing to die for their faith.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.100]   Now, of course, there were many that stumbled and fell away,
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.360]   and we don't actually get to hear about their accounts.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.080]   And we do remember Peter, right, in the Gospels,
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.400]   and he vowed vigorously that,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.440]   Lord, I will never deny you,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.400]   and remember what happens.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.160]   In his humanness, in the light of persecution,
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.120]   he was scared and he fled.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.600]   Now, of course, when we read the whole Gospel,
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.560]   we realize that Peter grew from that,
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.000]   and he became one of the greatest disciples.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.800]   And it says that the church was built upon him.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.260]   And so maybe not every one of us would struggle
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.300]   or have struggled to a point of death,
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.640]   but some of us, I know, have been persecuted.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.740]   A lot of us have been persecuted because of our faith,
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.420]   our family members not agreeing
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.540]   with this lifestyle choice that we made.
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.260]   And I know, actually, I've heard of some of you
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.360]   who work in very aggressive work environments
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.580]   where being a Christian is actually frowned upon,
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.420]   but yet somehow you persevered,
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.420]   somehow you remained faithful.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.340]   And for us in Hong Kong,
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.780]   I don't know what the future brings.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:03.900]   None of us do.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.640]   I don't know how religious freedom is in the future,
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.160]   but I think listening has an impact today.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.720]   Our listening today, in God's word,
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.300]   has an impact in how we respond tomorrow.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.620]   So, so far, I just wanna recap
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.640]   in these first two soil conditions
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.080]   that the ability to retain Jesus's word meaningfully
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.400]   in these first two soil conditions is temporal
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.960]   because, one, the seed never had space to grow,
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.560]   and also, these two soil conditions,
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.200]   they prevent good listening.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.780]   Now, I want to talk about the third soil conditions,
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.960]   which is the thorns.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.800]   So in verse seven,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.340]   when the seeds fell among the thorns,
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.200]   the thorns immediately came up and choked it
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.040]   and suffocated the seeds so that no crop could grow,
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.320]   so that seed could not germinate.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.280]   And when explaining to his disciples,
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.640]   Jesus said that these are those who heard the word,
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.840]   but the cares of the world, the worries,
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.160]   the temptation of wealth,
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.720]   and the desire for other things
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.360]   prevented the word, God's word, from bearing any fruit.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.100]   And so the third obstacles,
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.860]   we're talking about the worries that we have,
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:25.440]   the temptation of wealth, or even affluence,
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.860]   and these desires, they distract us, they entice us,
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.440]   they seduce us away from the path with Christ.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.860]   And so the seeds never germinate or grows
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.200]   because we put our resources on all these other things
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.580]   and not on protecting God's word, so allowing it to grow.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.780]   And I hate to mention this this morning, but I have to.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.740]   The things that we're talking about here
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.940]   is maybe our mobile devices, right?
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.380]   It's maybe Netflix.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.220]   It is.
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.860]   Some of us, even for good intentions,
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.680]   I overwork all the time, and that's a struggle,
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.420]   but yet it pulls me away from God.
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.380]   I'm two months to finishing
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.400]   my three-year master's right now,
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.540]   but the cost of the last three years
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.860]   has been immense in terms of time away from family,
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.900]   time away from God, and I feel it.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.540]   And so there is a cost to our discipleship,
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.340]   and Mark actually highlights,
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.900]   and I want you to remember this
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.200]   and think about this in your life,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.260]   that greed and affluence and having enough
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:37.260]   or wanting more will hinder and affect God's work in us.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:42.100]   In Mark 10, verse 21, you remember this,
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:46.940]   there's a rich man, he turns away from Jesus' call
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.900]   because he had too much wealth,
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.940]   and he didn't want to give up the system
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.860]   in which he exploited the poor.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.540]   And then there was Judas, who betrayed his own master,
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:00.540]   Jesus, for a small, small amount of money.
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.420]   And so this morning, I think God would want us
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:07.020]   to soberly reflect why it is so difficult
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.100]   for the rich to enter God's kingdom, right?
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.460]   Why it is so difficult, and I think we understand.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.420]   And so if I can pull together so far
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.780]   what we've been talking about,
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.580]   this morning we're talking about discipleship,
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.060]   we're talking about conditions
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.660]   for good listening and bad listening,
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.500]   we're talking about the obstacles
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.180]   that will come in our way, in all of our ways,
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.320]   and affect and impact our faith.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.060]   And once again, I want to say that this parable
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.580]   is talking about our spiritual reality.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.460]   This is the tension which all of us
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.060]   will have to learn to navigate,
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.460]   and that's why Jesus is saying,
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.560]   "Church, I want you to hear me.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.420]   "I want you to listen to what I'm saying to you."
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.340]   And actually, this warning, this parable,
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.800]   is it speaks so much about the scribes
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.060]   and the Pharisees in the Gospels.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.460]   Imagine how many times they heard Jesus preach.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.960]   Imagine how many times they heard God's word,
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.860]   but yet, what happens?
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.140]   Satan comes and steals the word from them,
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.940]   and they stop believing, they cannot believe.
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.900]   They vigorously reject the idea that God is Lord,
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.320]   so they kind of fall away in their discipleship.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.960]   And of course, ultimately, they fell away from Jesus
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.960]   because they did not understand what Jesus was doing.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.880]   That is why they couldn't have a relationship,
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.820]   a discipleship with Him.
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.940]   And so I want to say and acknowledge
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.680]   that the tension is real.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.860]   And lastly, I want to talk about the good soil.
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.700]   In the fourth soil condition, in verse eight,
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.440]   the grains fall on good soil,
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.020]   and these crops, they grew in an abundant harvest
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.260]   of 30, 60, and 100-fold.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.660]   The early church, when they immediately heard
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.100]   of bearing fruit, that these crops bore fruit,
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.360]   they would immediately equate this
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.300]   to faithfulness to Christ.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.980]   So what this means for us is that to be faithful
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.380]   to Christ requires time.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.620]   It requires a process for seeds to grow.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.260]   It requires overcoming.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:18.060]   And in terms of obstacles, the last batch of seeds
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:22.220]   grew to a harvest because these listeners
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.340]   were able to understand God's word.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.380]   They were able to wrestle with God's word.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.620]   They were able to trust that God's word
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.900]   would lead them through whatever obstacle
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.340]   and hindrances would come.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.700]   And as a result, these seeds, these listeners,
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:41.060]   grew abundantly, they grew to a point
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.860]   of surpassing all human understanding.
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.660]   And so I think to remain in good soil
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.140]   is to humbly allow God to lead us
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.500]   and to teach us what it means to grow deep roots
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.040]   so that we do not lose sight of the new life
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.580]   that Jesus calls each of us into, which is God's kingdom.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.700]   [audience laughing]
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.740]   And so you can see now that the different soil conditions
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.140]   that the first centuries Christians navigated through
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.220]   is not so much different than the discipleship reality
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.580]   that we live in right now.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.580]   And preparing for this message,
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.340]   I reflected on the last 25 years of being a Christian.
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:26.060]   I reflected on the last 14 years of working in a church,
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.720]   which I think is one of the hardest places to work,
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.580]   I think, from experience.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.580]   And so I just wanna list out,
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.900]   in relation to today's parable,
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.780]   some of the struggles I've gone through.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.280]   It's gonna just come up here.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.180]   You know, and you can go through this list,
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:51.140]   and I am sure you can relate to how
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.800]   and imagine how these things can cause us to be distracted,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.540]   could cause us to stumble,
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.620]   it can cause us to be enticed away.
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.060]   But I just wanna speak into a few of these personally.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.260]   In the last 10 years, I think all of us have experienced
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.580]   people leaving Hong Kong, right, family, friends.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.140]   That's been hard, especially working in a church.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.180]   But add to that, I've experienced a lot of brothers
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.580]   and sisters who walked away from the faith.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.020]   I think they decided that it was just too difficult
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.440]   to sustain discipleship, and that is discouraging.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.740]   There are times where I just ask the Lord,
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:31.140]   I would talk to my wife, and maybe I should just do the same.
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.180]   It just would be easier, you know.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.520]   Another thing is apathy.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.620]   I think all of us have to be very careful with apathy.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:43.080]   And we get offended, I get offended, something happens,
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.620]   and my heart just gets harder, it grows harder.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.300]   It's just less receptive to God's word.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.600]   When Jesus talked about the rich man
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.420]   having the dangers of being wealthy,
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.700]   which I think a lot of us are, would say that,
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.720]   "You know, we are actually rich when we think about it."
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.820]   And that is distracting, that is difficult to navigate.
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.420]   How do I be faithful and enjoy the life that we have?
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.520]   I struggle with that, I feel bad all the time.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.840]   And then lastly, I don't think I've been persecuted
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.420]   to a point of death, but I remember one time,
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.940]   I was trying to help this girl escape
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.640]   her abusive relationship with her boyfriend.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.460]   And so we were in Wan Chai in the coffee shop,
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.720]   and the boyfriend, unbeknownst to us, came,
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   but he refused to come in the church.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.960]   It's like he couldn't, and he was just angry,
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.580]   he was powerful, he was strong,
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.500]   and he just kept on yelling obscenities.
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.900]   And I just thought that it was an attack,
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.980]   it was Satan using the situation,
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.700]   and that really scared me, right?
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:51.320]   But all that to say, I think looking back,
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.540]   I can attest to the fact that God's grace
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.500]   has always been in these situations
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.740]   when I was going through it,
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.580]   and sometimes I just was not aware,
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.980]   but yet God's grace was there leading.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.540]   But yet, I also reflect back on all the effort
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:11.240]   I had to put in to get out of certain soil conditions,
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.820]   so certain barriers, and I think, to this day,
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.140]   I'm glad that I stand before you,
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.240]   and I still confess Christ, I still love Christ.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.060]   My love looks a little different than before,
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.160]   and I'm okay with that, but also,
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.940]   I still believe that we have so much to do as a church.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.860]   And so I think I share this because I think
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.100]   one of the most difficult things for us
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.180]   to practice as a Christian is the very thing
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.420]   that Jesus is talking about in this parable.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.500]   How many of us hurry from event to event, thing to thing,
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.900]   especially for us parents or teachers,
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.540]   and there's just always needy children,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.340]   which is the reality, right?
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.900]   But there is just so many things,
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.420]   and how many times do we say,
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.340]   hey, Lord, I'll come back to you later.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.340]   I'll do this later, I promise.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.980]   After I do all this, I will come back to you.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.220]   But when you think about it, that's thorns at work, right?
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.380]   That's thorns at work in our life.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.620]   And if there's one thing this morning
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.580]   I desperately want to convey to each of us here,
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:23.460]   what I wanna say is that it is extremely easy
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:28.420]   and effortless, it takes zero effort to stop growing
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.140]   and to walk away from God, if we choose that.
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.860]   It's effortless and it's very easy to get sidetracked,
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.380]   especially in moments of crisis,
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.080]   especially when we are persecuted, when we are suffering,
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.420]   when our hearts are broken.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.220]   But I want to remind us once again
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.060]   that even if our hearts are broken,
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.260]   even if we are suffering in this moment
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.180]   and we cannot bear it, God is still faithful,
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.100]   and he's still gonna scatter seeds generously
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.020]   until one seed hits the good soil,
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.740]   it hits our heart and it grows.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.620]   And for that, I think it's worth it.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:07.420]   And recently, I think as an encouragement,
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.660]   I was very encouraged that these three,
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.100]   four soil conditions, it actually represents
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:19.060]   our universal human Christian experience.
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.620]   That this doesn't just happen to holy people,
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.520]   it happens to all of us 'cause we are holy.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.580]   We love God and Satan would do everything
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.860]   to get us off course.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.280]   And so I wanna say that no Christian
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.900]   is immune from falling away,
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.180]   just as no Christian couple is immune from divorce, right?
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.060]   I think Satan will continue to do his work
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.820]   and we will always have trouble.
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.000]   Once we solve one problem, another problem comes in, right?
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.140]   We know that at work, at the home,
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.620]   in our house, I feel like we fix something good,
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.420]   you know, oh man, the lights are working again
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.660]   and then we have like another problem, right?
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:31:00.220]   And so this parable, it's in a bleak
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.580]   and black and white way, it reminds us of two realities.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:10.780]   One, we are either on the way towards Jesus, with Jesus,
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.820]   or we are somehow being led away.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.860]   We are somehow struggling, we are somehow caught up
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.900]   in thorns and we are learning to get out
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.440]   of those conditions.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:27.640]   But I want to comfort you, I'm not gonna end this message
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.820]   in gloom and doom.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.720]   I know it is difficult to be a Christian
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.940]   and I think you know that, it is difficult
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.420]   and that's okay, but it's not impossible
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.620]   because of God's grace.
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.500]   So I want to now talk about God's grace for us as a church.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:47.320]   And God's grace in this parable is an invitation
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.780]   for us this morning to reflect and to enter a space
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.800]   of deeper reflection through listening,
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.260]   to think about God and how we are with him
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.420]   through a deeper listening, but also listening
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.840]   invites us to a place of deeper surrender,
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:09.500]   to do things differently, to put away
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.680]   and to learn how to be a better listener.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.340]   And I believe by learning we increase our,
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.980]   by listening we increase our receptivity
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.820]   to hear God's word, to understand God's word
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.780]   so that we can actually ultimately protect God's word
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.060]   growing in our lives.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.660]   And so this morning right now to conclude
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:36.660]   I want to offer us three ways that God's grace
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.700]   is evident in this parable.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.020]   And the first way is that God's grace reminds us
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.700]   that the kingdom of God is always at work
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.300]   even when we are not aware.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.780]   And this is a hope, this is a promise for us
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.940]   that the sower that is Christ will continue
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.780]   to sow seeds and scatter seeds generously
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:04.660]   until it germinates beyond our wildest imaginations.
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:10.940]   And so Mark is reminding his listeners back then
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.540]   that against any setbacks, against any principalities,
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.420]   against any obstacles, God's kingdom will still advance
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.980]   and God's kingdom will continue to be victorious.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.900]   So for those of us here this morning
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.300]   we're listening to God's word,
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.420]   we're learning to listen to God's word.
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.640]   We should continue to do so.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.220]   For those of us who are faithful in preaching God's word
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.820]   we continue to share the gospel with our family,
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.940]   with our colleagues, with our friends.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.540]   Let us remain steadfast, let us remain faithful
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:45.100]   because each seed has hope to grow
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.660]   and it just has to hit a good soil.
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:49.940]   And I think a lot of us are here
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.820]   because God's word hits good soil
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.720]   and we heard God and we're here.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.020]   The second thing God's grace reminds us of this morning
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:04.320]   is God's paradoxical perspective on suffering.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.940]   I think only in God's kingdom does hardship,
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.120]   suffering, persecution enables Jesus' community
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.420]   to grow and advance.
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.860]   That our discipleship, our journey with Jesus
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.300]   does not diminish but it actually yields a harvest
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.760]   if we are willing to harvest that.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.600]   And the harvest here in this parable
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.040]   is really to know him.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.520]   You know the harvest that triples,
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.680]   that goes 60 folds, 100 folds,
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.760]   it's the reality that we can know a living God.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.280]   To know that his word is true, his promises is true.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.260]   That is the harvest that we desire.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:52.900]   And so we are able to overcome barriers
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.680]   and obstacles because we believe
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.360]   that the word of God is true, that he is true
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.180]   and that he is faithful to us.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:04.200]   And the last, I think God's grace reminds us
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.720]   in this parable that each of us have to,
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.720]   we each of us bear the responsibility to stop and to listen.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.200]   That each of us have this responsibility
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.520]   to listen to God's word because our very lives,
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.020]   our very faith depends on understanding
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.680]   what Jesus is saying to us.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.120]   I think there are, as I said,
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.600]   I think there's too many ways for us as Christians
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.880]   to fall away, for our hearts to feel cold,
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.280]   for us to be distracted and enticed and seduced.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.560]   And so it is our responsibility to figure out
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.720]   whether we want to be in that good soil.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.740]   It's our responsibility to ask God to teach us
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.600]   how do we set deeper roots into the ground
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.100]   so that when the sun comes, when persecution comes,
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.040]   we are not blown away easily.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.880]   It is our responsibilities to ask our neighbors
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.200]   to help us weed out some of the thorns
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.940]   in our gardens and our lives
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.340]   so that we can stay focused on Jesus.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.880]   And so church, I want to just lastly say,
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.200]   let us take seriously this responsibility
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.000]   so that we can minimize the chances of being uprooted,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.580]   of being deceived and being enticed away.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:21.580]   And so this morning, I will really end now.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:25.140]   I want to just ask us, how should we respond?
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.100]   How can we respond this morning?
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.060]   Thank you, Owen.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:33.620]   You know, and this morning, really, once again,
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.620]   I'm talking about our discipleship journey,
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.320]   our relationship with Jesus.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.060]   And I think by learning to listen,
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:45.580]   we are able to understand the four soil conditions,
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.720]   the spiritual tension, the reality
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.000]   that we live out our faith in,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.780]   and that we can hopefully avoid some of the traps
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:59.020]   and we can continue to just grow and to enjoy Jesus
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:02.460]   and enjoy our worshiping of Jesus together.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.960]   And if we do learn to listen,
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.420]   then we can continue to rely on God's word
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.920]   and then we are able to retain the vision
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.480]   of what it means to be Christ followers in this world.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.080]   So that we can allow other people
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:22.200]   and bring other people to experience this harvest.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.040]   And so church, I want to just ask you
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.520]   to really take seriously today
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.760]   and to take time to stop and pause
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.440]   and to listen to what God might be saying
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.240]   to you this morning.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.060]   Because without God's word,
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:43.080]   I think we are only followers by name and by association.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.400]   What makes us, I remember what Pastor John
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.960]   was preaching three weeks ago,
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.540]   what makes us salt and light
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.920]   is that we understand God's word.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.360]   It's God's word that brings life to us
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.680]   and it's our ability to share God's word with others
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.600]   that makes us distinctly different and attractive
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.760]   and that is the only really way
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.720]   we can have conversations about God
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.080]   with through his word anyways.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.880]   And so I just last say, I just want to encourage you.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.480]   I know maybe some of us, you feel,
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.200]   we feel that we're in unfruitful soil.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.720]   And to you, if that is you, I want to say, do not panic.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.000]   Do not be ashamed, do not be afraid.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.960]   You know, these conditions that we're in,
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.760]   they're not permanent.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.340]   They're seasons, maybe it's been a very long season for you.
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:35.120]   But I just want to encourage you
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.000]   and I want to pray for you in a moment
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.760]   that we would find our way back to God's soil.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.360]   We would just hold on to that seed that God has given you.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:49.200]   And so I just, last thing I want to say
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.040]   that even if we momentarily walk away from God,
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.320]   once again, the faithful sower will continue
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.000]   just to sow his seeds until his seeds
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.820]   hit the good soil for us.
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.980]   And so church, can I pray for us?
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.180]   Can I ask you to stand?
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.760]   (gentle music)
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:15.440]   Father, we thank you for your word.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.940]   And Father, we ask that this morning
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:28.700]   you would give us the courage to continue just to listen.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:33.640]   And Father, for those of us who are facing some obstacles,
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.140]   we are facing hardship,
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.800]   we find it difficult to hear your word.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.220]   We feel distracted, we feel there's too many things
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.640]   going on in our lives.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.300]   Father, I pray for,
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:52.060]   I pray, Father, that your seed would be attractive,
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:56.180]   your word in us would lead us out of these moments,
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.620]   Lord God.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.660]   Father, you would teach us how to hear your word today,
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.800]   what to do with your word today,
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   how to make time to just grow the seed, Lord God,
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.440]   that you've given us.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.200]   And Father, I pray that you give us courage each day
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.620]   to live faithfully to you, to follow you, Jesus.
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:25.980]   And so Father, right now we choose to worship you.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:32.760]   Father, we choose to follow you, and that is our desire.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:37.080]   And Lord, I just wanna pray that your word
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.960]   would be more desirable than the riches of this world.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.980]   It would be more desirable, more...
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:50.440]   Lord, it would just, Lord, we would just have,
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.500]   Lord, we would just want your word so badly,
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.440]   and that we would just learn
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.420]   to treasure your word in our life.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.920]   That is what I wanna pray for us today.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:04.860]   And so Jesus, we turn our eyes again to you in worship,
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:08.240]   in surrender, in reflection.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.520]   So would you lead us in your name we pray, amen.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.920]   Let's worship him together.
