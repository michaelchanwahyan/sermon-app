[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   In Jesus' name.
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.680]   Everyone says, hey, can we thank our worship team as always?
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.400]   Amazing.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.280]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.440]   And as you see it, I wonder whether you could imagine
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.400]   with me or think with me back to your childhood.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.160]   And I want you to think about the greatest memories
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   that you have of your childhood.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.760]   The times in your heart and in your lives
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.000]   that you remember back and you think back to almost
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.080]   what I would call core memories of your childhood.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.760]   Those moments where you think about all the great things
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.240]   that happened for you.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.360]   And maybe some of you have great memories of your family
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.600]   or great memories of a holiday you took
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.760]   or whatever it might be, but those memories where you're
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.800]   like, that defines who I was as a child.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.560]   Those are memories that I cherish,
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.640]   memories that I celebrate.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.440]   For me, so many of my core childhood memories,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.360]   they're located largely in one singular place.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360]   And that's this house.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.280]   This is the house that I lived in from the age
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.200]   of eight years old to about 11 years old.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.120]   The house is located in a small town in Connecticut
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.120]   on the Northeastern side of the US called Wilton.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.800]   Wilson's a small town and we lived in a small cul-de-sac
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.280]   in a small neighborhood.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.200]   And so many of my great childhood memories
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.880]   are from this particular house.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.920]   I think one of the reasons why I love this house so much
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.240]   is 'cause my dad loved this house so much.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.080]   My dad worked for a bank in the UK
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.080]   and he received a promotion.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.360]   And when I was seven years old, the bank said,
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.600]   "We wanna move you to the US and you're gonna start working
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.840]   "for the bank in the US."
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.680]   And so for a year we lived in Charlotte
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.400]   and then we moved up to this house.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.760]   And I remember my dad loved this house.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.400]   In fact, my dad probably took this photo.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.560]   This photo is from the early '80s.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.320]   My dad took this photo because the house represented
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.000]   for him really the first time in his life
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.200]   that he was able to provide something significant
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.360]   for his family.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.680]   He had a family of five and he had provided this home
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.360]   and there was a certain sense of pride
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.160]   that his family could grow up
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.880]   in a beautiful, spacious place like this.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.280]   My greatest memories of my father are found in this home.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.000]   I remember he taught me how to throw a baseball
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.520]   and catch it in the driveway of this house.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.400]   We played football on the lawn that you can see here,
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.480]   both the American kind and the British kind right there.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.000]   At winter, my father taught me how to ski here.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.480]   It would snow in Connecticut and you can't see it,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.440]   but on the left side of the building,
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.080]   there's a steep slope right there.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.960]   My father taught me to ski down that slope.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.480]   I remember the many hours that I spent with my father
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.320]   sitting in the living room here in like the little den area
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.200]   playing on an Atari Commodore 64.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.540]   I don't know if anyone is old enough to remember that.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.440]   That was a computer before they were computers basically.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.480]   So many of my favorite memories are of my father here
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.720]   and when I think about the best times of my childhood,
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.220]   this is the place I think of.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.320]   When my father passed away in March of 2019,
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.000]   I felt this overriding urge and motivation
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.240]   to return back to this house and visit it again.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.680]   This overriding sense of heart that I had,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.920]   that I wanted to reconnect with my father
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.280]   in the very place where I had
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.880]   the greatest memories of my father.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.720]   The funny thing is when we left here,
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.180]   when I was age 11 and we moved here to Hong Kong,
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.040]   we never went back.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.320]   I hadn't been back for over 35 or so years
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.760]   and so I felt as my father passed
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.280]   that to honor his memory and to reconnect with him
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.400]   in a deep way, I needed to get back to this house
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.080]   and so we had a sabbatical in the summer of 2019
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.640]   and so my wife, my daughter, myself, my mom and my brother,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.680]   we jumped on a plane from Hong Kong,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.240]   we flew to New York, we hired a car,
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.200]   we drove the three hours up the freeway
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.840]   and we entered into Wilton
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.480]   and the very first place we stopped was this house.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.640]   I remember pulling up along the driveway,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.440]   remember, quiet cul-de-sac, we parked the car,
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.920]   all of us got out of the car and there was this fence
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.000]   that lined up next to the house
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.480]   and we leaned on the fence and we looked at the house
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.360]   for the first time in 35 years.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.240]   We would have looked very strange.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.120]   That's what the house looks like today.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.280]   It's essentially the same house
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.200]   just with a different paint job
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.440]   and as we were staring at it, staring at it,
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.120]   if anybody had driven by, it would have been weird,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.760]   this group of like seven people just going like this.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.360]   I remember the joy that I felt in my heart
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.360]   because Mia, my daughter, was with me
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.440]   as we were looking at this house
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.600]   and she was about the same age as I was
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.720]   when I lived there.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.920]   And as I was staring at the house,
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.640]   I realized this is not enough for me.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.120]   I have to be inside the house.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.840]   This is a very creepy thing, I know,
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.540]   but I had to work out how am I gonna get myself
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.560]   inside this house?
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.240]   So I devised a plan.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.960]   I decided that I would buy a really nice card
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.360]   and I would write a letter inside this card
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.080]   and in the letter I would say,
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.540]   I used to live in this house from the age of eight to 11
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.040]   and it was my father's favorite house
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.200]   and my father's just died of cancer
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.760]   and you need to let me come in
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.280]   and relive the memories of this house.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.400]   Please let me in.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.560]   Here's my mobile phone, call me.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.760]   I wrote the best letter anyone has ever written
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.120]   and I dropped it into the little mailbox.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.360]   You know, like in America, you put up the little flag,
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.120]   you know, to say that there was some mail there,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.960]   did a little prayer and then we retreated to our hotel.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.720]   I got my mobile out and I was like,
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.720]   two hours later, the phone rings
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.880]   and it's the wife in the house.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.920]   She's wife, husband, two kids
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.160]   and she's like crying on the phone.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.420]   She's like, your letter so moved me.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.880]   We bought this house five years ago
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.540]   and we love this home and it's so good to hear
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.600]   that you love it as well and your father's just passed away
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.480]   and would you like to come over tomorrow
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.000]   at 10 o'clock for coffee?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.960]   I would love to host you in the home
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.640]   and help you to relive your memories
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.680]   and I was like, yeah.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.080]   Four hours later, the phone rings again.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.440]   This time, it's the husband of the house.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.240]   This is a very different conversation
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.320]   to the one with the wife of the house.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.700]   The husband's like, who are you?
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.680]   Why do you wanna come into my house when I'm not around?
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.280]   Like, who are you?
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.680]   Tell me about, and literally, like he was kind of aggressive
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.680]   he was like, how do I know you're not a freak?
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.360]   How do I know that you're gonna come into this house
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.520]   and you've just written a nice letter
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.560]   to work your way into the home
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.720]   and you're gonna do something nasty in our house?
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.200]   Like, this is terrible, who are you?
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.680]   So basically, he's asking for like a LinkedIn live
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.720]   kind of like go through my whole history with him, right?
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.240]   So I'm like, well, I was born in the UK
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.480]   and I started to go through my history.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   That wasn't good enough.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.360]   He wanted to know every place that I'd ever worked
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.960]   and what position I had held in the places where I worked.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.960]   It was like I was being interviewed for the CIA.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.640]   So I'm going like, okay, sure.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   So, well, I originally worked at this headhunting company
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.600]   and I did that for a while
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.560]   and then I moved to an American investment bank
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.320]   called Morgan Stanley and I worked there for a while.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.200]   He's like, what did you just say?
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   And I said, oh, I worked for a US investment bank
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.480]   called Morgan Stanley, I worked there.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.320]   He's like, you worked for Morgan Stanley?
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.160]   I said, yeah.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.080]   He said, I've worked for Morgan Stanley for 38 years.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.760]   And he said, if you've worked for Morgan Stanley,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.800]   if you're good enough to work for Morgan Stanley,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.480]   you're good enough to come into my house.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.800]   So the next day, 10 o'clock, knock on the door.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.240]   The wife welcomes us into my childhood home.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.160]   And I can't really describe the emotions I felt
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.000]   as I walked through that house.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.400]   We got this cheesy family photo outside.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.920]   The one on the top there is my mom
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.960]   when she was super young with her mother
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.240]   and there's my mom and the rest of our family
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.120]   and my daughter there outside the front.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.480]   As we walked through every single room,
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.120]   I just had wave after wave of emotion
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.000]   and memory of my father.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.120]   I remember connecting with him deeply as I was walking,
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.440]   but I also sensed something else
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.600]   that I didn't expect to sense.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.280]   And that was a sense of closure.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.560]   I actually felt like my father was with me
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.400]   walking through the house and saying,
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.240]   "This was what you had.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.280]   "And this is what we had.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.500]   "And it was a good thing.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.620]   "But now you have a daughter of your own
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.680]   "and you have future core memories
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.640]   "that you need to give to her."
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.280]   And I felt like my father was like passing a baton to me
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.280]   as I was walking through the home.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.040]   And I realized that in that moment,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.800]   there was a shift that was happening within me.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.400]   And this house meant so much to me,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.840]   so many of my core memories,
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.200]   so many of my memories as a child to a father.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.520]   And I felt like what my father was encouraging me to do
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.800]   as I walked through the house was to shift my mentality
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.000]   and my identity to thinking about myself
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.320]   not as a child to a father in this home,
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   but now as a father to my child, Mia.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.520]   And that shifting point in identity
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.520]   was one of the key reasons why I was able
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.960]   to begin to move through the morning
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.000]   that I was feeling at this time.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.880]   I remember leaving that house and getting in the car
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.560]   and feeling very emotional, shedding a few tears,
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.120]   thinking to myself, "I'm a father and I have a daughter
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.300]   "and I get to create such great memories.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   "And I wanna live my father's legacy
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.480]   "by now shifting away from just thinking about being his son
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.120]   "to being a father myself."
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.640]   As we come to the halfway point of Exodus
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.320]   and as we come to chapters 19 and 20
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.920]   that we're looking at this week and next week,
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.800]   this idea of a shift in identity
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.320]   is what these two chapters are all about.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.400]   These are the chapters that capture for us
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.200]   Moses and Israel returning to the very place
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.040]   where Moses had been some 35, 40 odd years earlier,
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.200]   a place that held for him so many great core memories,
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.400]   the very place where he had met with God 40 years before
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.360]   in the burning bush
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.800]   and had such a profound encounter with God.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.480]   He's now returned to the same place, Mount Sinai.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.200]   And this Mount Sinai was a little bit like me
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.880]   returning to that house in Connecticut.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.600]   It was a place of deep connection for him.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.000]   Could we put up the Mount Sinai picture, please?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.440]   There you go.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.600]   It was a place of connection for Moses.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.120]   It was a place where he could find himself
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.800]   with God once again, because prior, 40 years ago,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   that's what had happened for him.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.760]   That time in the burning bush, Moses was a broken man,
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.880]   a broken man struggling with his identity,
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.280]   wondering, am I actually a prince of Egypt
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.520]   or am I an Israelite?
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.600]   And he's stuck between these two identities
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.400]   that were causing him a lot of tension.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.040]   He had just murdered an Egyptian
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.480]   and fled from that Egyptian.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.320]   And now here he is in this mountain
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.720]   and God appears in a fire on a bush
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.240]   and calls him towards him.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.200]   Says, "Take up your sandals."
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.760]   The ground, he's standing on this holy ground.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.000]   And God begins to speak to him of a new identity.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.560]   Begins to say that I've got a purpose
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.200]   and a value and something for your life.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.280]   And Moses begins to realize
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.960]   that his life has not come to an end here.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.400]   There's a new beginning.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.720]   And he begins to receive the call from God
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.720]   to go back to Egypt,
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.280]   the very place that he did not want to go to,
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.280]   and actually say to Pharaoh, "Let my people go,"
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.680]   because God wants them to come and to be with him.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.520]   And as God's giving him this vision
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.520]   and this idea of his identity,
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.120]   Moses is pushing back on it.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.560]   And I think we all do this as Christians.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.040]   When God speaks to us of calling and vision and identity,
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.680]   it's very easy for us to push back and say,
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.080]   "Well, I can't do that.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.080]   "That can't be me.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.360]   "I'm not like that.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.240]   "I don't have those gifts.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.200]   "I don't have those skills."
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.880]   And Moses is doing this before God.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.840]   And God, because he's a father,
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.040]   gives a fatherly promise to Moses at this time.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.600]   This is in chapter three.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.640]   We've looked at this before,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.560]   but let me just remind you of this.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.240]   In chapter three, verse 12,
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.200]   and God says this to Moses, "I will be with you.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.360]   "And this will be a sign to you
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.200]   "that it is I who has sent you.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.520]   "When you have brought the people out of Egypt,
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.040]   "you will worship God on this mountain."
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.360]   In other words, you're gonna return back
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.800]   to this very place with a free people.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   And at that time, Moses was like,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.240]   "I don't even know if that's ever gonna happen."
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.720]   And now, as we're in chapter 19,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.120]   the very thing that Moses believed would never happen
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.800]   has happened.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.440]   He and Israel return to the mountain to worship God.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.160]   Let me read to you how actually Moses talks about it
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.200]   at the start of chapter 19.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.680]   "In the third month, after the Israelites left Egypt,
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.120]   "on the very day,"
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.240]   notice this, Moses is being very personal here.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.960]   He's like, "I remember the very day
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.120]   "they came to the desert of Sinai.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.560]   "After they set out from Rephidim,
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.960]   "they entered the desert of Sinai,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   "and Israel camped there in the desert
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.920]   "in front of the mountain."
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.800]   I wonder if you could sense the emotions
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.200]   that Moses must've been feeling.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.880]   Like me, walking through the house
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.720]   and all those emotions of those connections
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   to core memories.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.120]   Now, here's Moses standing at the mountain
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.560]   with all of Israel with him,
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.280]   and all those core memories come back.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.560]   And all that God had promised
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.880]   and all that God said he would do has actually happened.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.120]   And I can imagine that Moses is standing at the mountain
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.000]   full of joy, full of wonder, full of amazement
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.080]   that God has done what he said he was gonna do,
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.200]   that his people are free and his people have gathered.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.600]   And you could sense Moses welling up in worship.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.680]   The very thing that God has said,
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.600]   "You're gonna return to this mountain and worship me."
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.280]   There is Moses going, "I can't believe it, but we're here."
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.640]   This is personal for Moses,
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.520]   because he has gone from a place of a broken identity
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.520]   to a place of a leader of his people.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.960]   And as he's standing at that mountain,
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.680]   I'm sure he's saying, "Only because of you, God."
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.880]   This personal nature for Moses with Mount Sinai
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.600]   was what I wanted to try and capture for you
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.760]   as we actually did a film for this particular week.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.880]   And when I was talking to the crew some four years ago
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.600]   and we were planning out every film,
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.040]   I was like, "Wouldn't it be awesome
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.160]   if we actually did the hike up Mount Sinai ourself?"
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.800]   Now, Moses, when he did it, there was no path there at all.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.840]   And these days, there's a very well-worn path.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.640]   And if you're fit, you can actually do
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.600]   the about four and a half hour hike
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.040]   from the base of Mount Sinai up to the top.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.600]   If you're not fit, you can get a camel
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.800]   to take you up three quarters of the way,
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.560]   but then you still gotta do about a quarter of it.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.680]   And we thought it'd be fantastic.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.800]   Why don't we film this?
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.760]   And unlike the other films in the series
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.000]   where we have scripts and we have it all planned out,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.440]   this one, we're just gonna make it pretty raw.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.480]   Because for Moses, it would have been raw.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.040]   It would have been this kind of pilgrimage
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.000]   for him to go up a mountain.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.960]   I said, "Why don't I go on a pilgrimage up the mountain?
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.840]   Let's film it.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.920]   Let's not script it.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.240]   Let's just see what happens.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.440]   Let's capture it for everybody."
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.680]   And hopefully in that,
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.720]   help people to understand the personal nature
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.760]   of what chapters 19 and 20 are all about,
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.660]   but also the personal nature
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.320]   of what this part of the Exodus story has to say to you.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.080]   So let's take a look at my hike.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:03.200]   Exodus chapter 19 is perhaps the most pivotal chapter
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.520]   in the whole of the Exodus story.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.520]   God calls Moses up to the top of Mount Sinai
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.160]   so he can meet with him,
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.620]   commune face to face,
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.960]   and ultimately give him the 10 commandments
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.760]   that will shape God's people forever.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.360]   Now, ever since I was a kid
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.060]   and came to faith in my early 20s,
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.780]   I've always had this deep desire in me
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.660]   to follow in Moses' footsteps,
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.340]   to actually do the hike myself up Mount Sinai
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.780]   and kind of experience for myself
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.660]   what it would be like to meet with God on the mountain.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:38.000]   Well, today, actually, the dream comes into reality.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.180]   I'm about to hike up Mount Sinai here,
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.460]   and there are some camels right here
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.580]   that are gonna go right past me.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.420]   Watch this, watch this.
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.380]   This is a real thing.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.220]   Go.
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.800]   (gentle music)
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.840]   There you go.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.720]   That's how it works here.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.040]   All right, anyway, so I just stepped in the camel poo too.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.720]   But anyway, the camels are gonna go ahead of us.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.960]   I'm gonna hike up to Mount Sinai right now,
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.980]   and I'm really excited.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.800]   It's about just before midnight.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.920]   It's super cold.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.960]   It's gonna be a little bit windy,
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.720]   but I'm really excited to do this,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.200]   and I can't wait 'cause I'm gonna bring you along
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.520]   with me on the journey.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.360]   Let's go.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.940]   (gentle music)
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.940]   (gentle music)
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:25.080]   As I take the first few steps here
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.560]   past St. Catherine's Monastery,
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.960]   yeah, I'm reflecting on kind of the journey already.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.880]   It's been four years of the Exodus Project
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.920]   to get to this point,
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.140]   and it's taken years of study and research and preparation,
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.480]   and then COVID delayed it,
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.560]   and then now I'm finally here.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.760]   I've dreamt about this hike for so long,
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.600]   and it makes me think about our Christian journey, actually,
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.280]   that while study and research of Scripture
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.480]   is, of course, important,
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.680]   it's actually the doing that really counts.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.280]   It's actually putting what you've learned into practice
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.480]   that matters the most,
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.680]   and every single step I'm taking
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.320]   is a little bit kind of a metaphor on my own Christian life
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.560]   in the sense that every single day
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.920]   I have to take that next step in my journey with Jesus,
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.680]   and it's a practice of faith.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.400]   It's not just a research of faith,
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.480]   and as I start out on the trip,
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.520]   I'm reflecting a little bit about Moses's journey himself.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.440]   I mean, he didn't have a nice path to walk on like I do.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.160]   He would have had to scramble up all the rocks
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.320]   to get to the summit,
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.080]   and I'm sure at the beginning point,
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.520]   Moses was thinking to himself,
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.960]   "Why doesn't God come and meet me down here?
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.800]   "Why do I have to go up there to meet with God?"
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.400]   I mean, God had met Moses on a flat plain
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.080]   in a burning bush in the past.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.360]   Why not now?
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.120]   And I think God was trying to teach Moses something.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.120]   He was trying to let him know
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.000]   that actually the relationship he's forming in Israel
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.200]   is gonna require obedience, faithfulness.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.600]   It's gonna require them to sacrifice.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.160]   It's gonna be a hard, narrow path.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.320]   Jesus, many years, would reflect the same.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.760]   He would say, "If you wanna follow me,
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.280]   "you're gonna have to pick up your cross.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.600]   "There's gonna be sacrifice.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.720]   "There's gonna be the need for obedience."
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.040]   And I think the journey up the mountain
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.920]   was really part of the formation for Moses.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:11.720]   Here's another thought.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.000]   You know, it's so dark here as we've been walking
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.840]   that I've been tempted to pull out a flashlight
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.480]   and use some artificial light to help me to walk.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.120]   And I think we do that in our sin as well.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.280]   When we're faced with the darkness of our sin,
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.680]   we try to throw some artificial light over it
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.200]   to make ourselves feel better about it,
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.360]   to try to pretend that it's no big deal,
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.000]   or maybe convince ourselves
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.400]   that we're gonna deal with it and get over it easily,
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.960]   when the reality is it's deeply entangled in us.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.920]   See, when you hike in a place like this,
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.520]   it's actually best not to use artificial light.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.760]   It's best just to walk in the darkness,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.160]   to actually get accustomed to the darkness,
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.600]   to allow your eyes to realize
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.240]   the sort of optical illusion that is there
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.840]   when you use artificial light.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.920]   And I think it's the same for our sin.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.040]   When we put away those artificial lights
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.120]   that try to make ourselves feel better about it,
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.000]   and actually just sit in the actual reality
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.600]   of the darkness of sin,
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.280]   it enables us to know where we're starting
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.880]   when it comes to repentance.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.720]   And I think that's such an important part
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.120]   of the Christian journey.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.560]   I wanna encourage you to put away your artificial lights,
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.440]   and actually allow yourself to realize
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.240]   where you are in the sin that you're struggling with.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.640]   And from that point, God can bring his real light.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.000]   It's not artificial light when it comes to Christ.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.120]   It's light that brings us into freedom.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:37.200]   So we've been walking for about 40, 45 minutes now.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.880]   That's St. Catherine's in the village down there.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.160]   Our path is up here.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:20:01.720]   All right, I'm here at the halfway house of the mountain.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.880]   I'm literally about halfway up now.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.360]   And this is such a nice place to rest.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.520]   I mean, it's so comfortable here.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.960]   There's a beautiful fire.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.000]   And I tell you what, it's quite cold on the mountain.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.160]   So I've been here about 10 minutes now,
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.920]   and it's really comfortable.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.200]   Had a cup of tea.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.680]   And I've been reflecting that so often,
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.560]   this is like our spiritual journey.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.320]   God calls us to a destination.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.000]   And it's a difficult journey up the hill.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.640]   And it takes a lot of courage and a lot of sacrifice.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.320]   And we get about halfway,
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.920]   and we're tempted to settle there in our spiritual lives,
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.800]   in our spiritual halfway house.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.880]   And we kind of convince ourselves,
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.480]   oh, yeah, God called me up there,
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.040]   but I've already sacrificed so much,
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.560]   and I'm happy where I am right now.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.680]   And we kind of settle into this kind of halfway house
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.800]   mediocrity of our spiritual lives,
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.320]   knowing that Christ is calling us deeper,
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.600]   but happy just to settle where we are.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.080]   And I think that's the great temptation
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.680]   of all of our spiritual journeys.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.800]   And for me right now, I'd be happy to tell you,
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.400]   oh yeah, I made it to the top of the mountain,
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.200]   but kind of fake it and just stay here
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.840]   and then go back down the hill.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.000]   But that's not really what it is.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.400]   God has called us to be at the top,
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.280]   and we need to keep pressing into our relationship with Him.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.760]   So I'm gonna rest a little bit more,
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.480]   and then I'm gonna pick myself up, get going again.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.720]   And I wanna encourage you to do that
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.640]   in your spiritual life too.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.760]   If you feel like you've kind of rested,
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.200]   if you feel like you've sort of settled
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.640]   into mediocrity in your spirituality,
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.080]   can I encourage you, get up, get going again.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.160]   There's so much more that's ahead.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.760]   (gentle music)
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:44.000]   As they say in Egypt, yalla.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.120]   Yalla, all right, let's go.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.920]   All right, we're about like, I don't know,
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.840]   maybe like three quarters of the way up now.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.080]   And like this is Mount Sinai right here.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.960]   This is the rock, you know what I mean?
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.160]   Like it's really actually beginning to feel
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.520]   a little bit like I think what Moses would have seen.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.640]   I think the earlier part of the walk,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.160]   it felt like I was in some national park
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.000]   anywhere in the world.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.760]   But now when you see the kind of color here,
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.360]   you may not be able to see the color 'cause it's dark,
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.840]   but the actual shape and the feel,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.120]   it's like this is kind of what I had in mind.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.240]   And it's really special, really special.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.800]   Mount Sinai.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.400]   (laughs)
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:37.600]   I'm about three hours into the hike now
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.640]   and I'm on a staircase.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.320]   It's a rock staircase.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.440]   It's about 750 stairs now to the summit.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.280]   So I'm not actually that far from the summit,
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.000]   but this is the hardest part of the hike.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.400]   I'm out of breath.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.080]   The stairs are tall and steep.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.680]   And it's got me to reflect a little bit
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.400]   about our spiritual lives again, right?
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.440]   So often when we get close to a goal
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.360]   that Christ has put in our hearts, things get harder.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.680]   You know, we often think in a climb up the mountain
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.320]   that the hardest part is at the start.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.160]   It's not true.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.680]   The steepest part of the mountain
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.040]   is always right before the summit.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.000]   And it's the same with us in our spiritual lives
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.760]   with the goals that Christ gives us.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.200]   The enemy loves to come in right at the end
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.880]   when we've almost achieved the goal
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.400]   and try to knock us back again,
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.800]   try to make it so hard that we'll quit
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.680]   right at the finish line.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.240]   And I'm kind of feeling like that right now.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.360]   I'm like, man, I don't know if I've got much more energy
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.200]   to get up there.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.480]   And that's when we need to press in again.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.880]   We need to push through that barrier and keep going.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.360]   And I imagine Moses,
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.280]   as he's at this part of the mountain as well,
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.800]   he's thinking like, it's not that far, but it's super hard.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.200]   I think the hardest part of the climb
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.760]   is ahead of us right now.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.120]   And yeah, so we've got to push in.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.520]   Actually, there are actually about 3,750 steps
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.280]   from the very base of the mountain to the summit.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.800]   And the monks that live here,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.560]   they call it the staircase of repentance
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.720]   because of the pain involved in getting up to the top.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.560]   And I have to say, now that I'm almost there,
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.760]   these stairs are very well-named.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.360]   (gentle music)
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:41.160]   Well, after nearly four hours of hiking,
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.080]   I finally made it to the summit.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.960]   You can't see much right now 'cause it's still night.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.640]   It's still dark.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.200]   Ah, man, what a trip.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.720]   That was incredible.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.400]   Super hard, but I'm so glad to be here.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.720]   I'm at 2,285 meters.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.120]   That's how high we are right now.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.480]   And in a few moments, the sun will rise up behind me.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.080]   And you know, as I get here in the darkness,
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.520]   it makes me think about Moses
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.280]   when he first arrived on the summit.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.800]   You know, he must've had this mixture
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.680]   of excitement and anticipation,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.040]   but I would also think probably a little bit
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.960]   of anxiety and fear as he's about to walk into the fog,
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.480]   you know, the presence of God
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.920]   that was on the mountain at the time.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.960]   And it must've been just this awesome sense of God here.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.640]   And you know, the fear in him must've been very palpable.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.480]   And you know, it's a significant moment.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.600]   The courage of Moses to not just do the walk up here,
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.640]   but then to walk into the presence of God
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.440]   and literally receive the law
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.120]   that would come to reshape the Jewish people
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.000]   and who they are and really change all of history.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.400]   That happened right here.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.280]   And as I sit here in this moment,
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.840]   having finally achieved my dream,
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.680]   I'm really quite overwhelmed by the profundity
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.840]   of what happened right here.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.240]   (soft music)
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:27.840]   There's a section in Exodus 19
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.320]   where in the Hebrew it reads this.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.240]   It says, "Moses comes up to the top of the mountain
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.240]   "and then is on the top of the mountain."
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.160]   Now in the Hebrew, it repeats top of the mountain twice
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.640]   in the same sentence, and it has confounded scholars.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.680]   But actually here is what it means.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.280]   It means that for Moses,
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.400]   this experience of meeting God required two things.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.040]   There was the coming up to the top of the mountain.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.560]   That was the doing.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.640]   But then when he was on the summit, like I am right now,
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.160]   he had to then be with God.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.840]   That was the second part of being
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   on the top of the mountain.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.800]   So Moses was here and he needed to settle
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.400]   in the presence of God, be with him,
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.360]   stop his doing and just rest.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.560]   And now that I'm here on the summit with the sun coming up,
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.360]   that's exactly what I wanna do.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.720]   So I'm gonna wrap this up here.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.800]   I'm so grateful that you were on the journey with me
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.320]   up the mountain, but now I'm just gonna spend some time
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.160]   to be with God.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.560]   (soft music)
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.960]   (soft music)
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.360]   (soft music)
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.760]   (soft music)
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.760]   (soft music)
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.520]   It is this idea of being and not just doing
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.040]   that Exodus 19 and 20 are all about.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.440]   Because it is now here where God is gonna reshape
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.120]   their identity as a people.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.320]   It's been again to help them to understand
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.680]   who they truly are.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.480]   And I wanna just unpack a little bit about that here,
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.880]   if you're willing to give me about another 10, 15 minutes.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.800]   Is that all right?
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.920]   Everybody handle that?
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.000]   You didn't do the hike, I did the hike, say yes.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.440]   Good.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.120]   I did it for you.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.640]   No, it's good, okay.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.520]   Verse three says, "And Moses went up to God
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.840]   "and the Lord called to him from the mountain and said,
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.400]   "this is what you are to say to the house of Jacob
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.520]   "and what you are to tell the people of Israel.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.760]   "You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.920]   "and how I carried you on eagles wings
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.720]   "and brought you to myself."
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.560]   I love it.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.400]   The first thing God does is he basically does
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.640]   like previously on the Exodus, right?
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.400]   And he takes them on this kind of journey
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.840]   of what's already happened.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.120]   And he says, "You yourselves have seen what I did in Egypt.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.640]   "You understood all the things that I've done,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.240]   "how I revealed myself to you,
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   "how I showed you my power and my might,
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.080]   "how I was compassionate for you.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   "You saw the plagues, you saw the parting of the Red Sea,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.960]   "you saw the manifold from heaven.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.600]   "You saw all of that and you understand that
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.820]   "because you know me.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.520]   "I've revealed myself to you in all of that."
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.520]   He says, "I carried you on eagles wings,
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.520]   "the idea I'm intimately caring for you.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.200]   "I stepped in, you didn't do any of that
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.080]   "in your own strength.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.880]   "I did all that for you."
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.480]   God is saying, "I carried you
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.120]   "on these intimate eagles wings."
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.640]   And he said, "I brought you to myself."
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.400]   Notice this, he doesn't say, "I brought you to freedom."
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.760]   He doesn't say, "I brought you to success."
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.000]   He doesn't say, "I achieved all your dreams for you."
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.040]   He said, "What I've done for you is I freed you
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.560]   "in order that you would find a home in me,
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.720]   "that you would come to myself."
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.320]   You know, the greatest gift
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.200]   that God will ever give you is himself.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.600]   Come on church, it is himself.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   It's not always the things that you're dreaming for.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.800]   It's not always the things you're praying for.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.680]   It's not even sometimes you're healing.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.800]   It's not even sometimes that restoration you want.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.280]   The greatest gift that he'll give
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.920]   and he wants to heal you, he wants to restore you,
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.820]   he wants to do all those things,
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.120]   but the greatest thing he will ever do for you
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.440]   is show himself to you, is welcome you into his presence
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.560]   so that you can have an intimate relationship with you.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.400]   And he said, "I've done this.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.060]   "I've carried you guys on my wings.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.640]   "I've brought you to myself."
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.700]   And he starts by saying,
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.400]   "You yourselves have experienced all this."
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.840]   This is the only time in the Hebrew
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.160]   in the whole of the Old Testament
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.040]   where the words you is repeated twice side by side.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.880]   So in English, we say you yourselves,
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.840]   but in the Hebrew, it's you, you.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.060]   What he's saying is you corporately know what's happened,
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.220]   but you individually also know what's happened.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.660]   In other words, you have a personal encounter
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.660]   and you've personally witnessed
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.840]   all the things that I've done
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.540]   from the time that you were in slavery in Egypt
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.540]   all the way up to now.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.540]   It's like God is basically saying this to Israel.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:38.540]   He's saying, "You know me, but do you know who you are?"
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:43.460]   You know who I am 'cause I've done all these things.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.360]   I've revealed myself to you
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.520]   and you've seen it all personally, corporately in person.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.480]   You know who I am, but do you know who you are?
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.920]   He's challenging them.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.280]   Do you have an understanding of your identity?
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.240]   Do you know what it is that I've saved you for?
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.560]   Do you know what it is that I've rescued you for?
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.160]   Do you know what your purpose is, your value is,
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.000]   your mission is?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.440]   Do you understand what it is that I've done in you?
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.220]   And the reality is that God had revealed himself
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.280]   to Moses at the burning bush, to Pharaoh,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.760]   to Egypt and to Israel.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.520]   He's brought them all to this mountain,
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.420]   but the story doesn't finish here.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.760]   Chapter 19 would be a nice place
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.220]   to wrap up the story, wouldn't it?
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.540]   Maybe the Exodus could have been just chapters one to 19,
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.180]   and that would have been a nice bow on the whole story
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.940]   'cause we would have seen God's deliverance.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.140]   But if that had happened,
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.220]   all we would have learned is who God is.
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.340]   And what God wants to do at this part of the story
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.220]   and for the next 20 chapters is to tell you who you are,
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.180]   to help Israel understand who they are
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.180]   in their identity with him
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.620]   and to help you understand who you are
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.140]   in your identity with Christ.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.400]   That's what the rest of the Exodus story is all about.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.520]   See, our journey in Exodus is not just a journey
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.720]   in a God who makes himself known,
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.300]   it's a journey in a God who makes ourselves known.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.500]   And some of you here,
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.140]   you've experienced a deliverance out of some sin
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.440]   that you've been perhaps enslaved to,
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.160]   but you're still struggling to know who you are.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.320]   You're still struggling to know what your value is,
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.740]   what your mission is, what your calling in life is.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.720]   The number one question I get as a pastor,
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.480]   "Pastor Andrew, what is my calling in life?"
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.720]   Well, if you give me another 10 minutes,
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.400]   I'll tell you what your calling in life is
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.400]   because this is what Israel is crying out and wondering.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.680]   We're free now, but what are we gonna do?
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.080]   Who are we?
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.400]   And what is God gonna do in and through us?
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.760]   And so God begins to unpack the idea of what he's gonna do.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.680]   You need to understand that the number one thing
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.220]   that slavery does, it strips your identity from you.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.980]   The whole definition of slavery is designed
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.100]   to strip from you your value and who you are
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.540]   and how you understand yourself.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.060]   I've actually had, I wouldn't call it the privilege,
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.580]   but I've actually sat with traffickers in Bangkok.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.340]   I was working with an NGO at the time
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.580]   and we were connected with traffickers, human traffickers.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.460]   And I met with this trafficker and he explained to me
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.380]   that the number one priority they have
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.820]   when they take women is to so disempower
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.680]   and strip them of their identity
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.660]   that they basically think they have no worth
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.220]   and no value so they won't fight back.
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:22.460]   And that should shock us.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.820]   But that's what the enemy does with every form of slavery.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.900]   Any sin that we are enslaved through
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.400]   is designed to strip you of your identity
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.660]   and how you've been created in the image of God
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.380]   and how God sees you and to strip your value
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.900]   and how you understand yourself.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.380]   And so when you get free from a sin,
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.660]   when God heals you and you bring your sin to him
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.420]   and you repent of it and he washes you white as snow,
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.620]   it's a wonderful thing,
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.540]   but there's another step that should happen after that.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.860]   'Cause not only is it one thing to be taken out of slavery,
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.500]   it's another thing to then discover who we now truly are.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.740]   Israel arrives at Mount Sinai
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.960]   and they have no idea who they are.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.800]   Are you with this?
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.180]   And when we come out of our sin,
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.220]   we have to remember that we have lost
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.400]   something of our identity because of that sin.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.820]   The enemy comes to kill and destroy,
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.420]   but Jesus comes to give life and life abundant.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:21.480]   See, one of the very core ideas of the whole Exodus
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.560]   is that you're not just saved from something,
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.380]   you're saved to something.
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.260]   And this is where Israel is.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:33.080]   And God is saying, "Do you know why I've saved you?
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.060]   Would you like to know why?
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.140]   No? Okay, let's go.
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:41.420]   Would you like to know why you're saved?
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.740]   Why you have a calling?
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.660]   Why God wants you free to himself
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.740]   so that you can live for him?
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.820]   Let me show you what God says next.
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:50.980]   Verse five.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.020]   Now, if you obey me fully and keep my covenant,
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.140]   then out of all the nations,
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:57.460]   you will be my treasured possessions.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.340]   Although the whole earth is mine,
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.220]   you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.300]   These are the words that you are to speak to the Israelites.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.700]   In a moment where Israel is going, "Who are we?"
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.180]   Because we don't know who we are anymore
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:15.500]   because in slavery, our whole identity has been submerged.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.700]   We've been disempowered.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.220]   We've been stripped of who we are.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.900]   They're now standing at Mount Sinai
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.220]   and they're saying, "Who are we?"
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.980]   And the very first thing God says to Moses on the mountain
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.740]   is, "This is who you are."
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.700]   And for some of you in the room,
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.620]   what I'm about to tell you
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:32.820]   is the most singular important thing for you
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.980]   to truly grow in Christ Jesus.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.060]   Because what God says in this moment
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.940]   helps to unpack so much for Israel
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.140]   and I think so much for you.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.260]   Let me break down what it is that God does.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.940]   Is this helpful for anyone?
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.900]   Okay, let me break down for you
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.140]   exactly what God is saying about...
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:54.140]   So first of all, God has made himself known.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:59.500]   That's the first thing he tells Israel.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.540]   He reminds them.
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.380]   Oh, hello.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.100]   (mimics horn)
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.020]   This is not gonna go well, is it?
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.100]   Okay, here.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.140]   (sings)
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.060]   All right, give me one second.
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.420]   I'm gonna fix this properly.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.940]   Oh no, it's getting worse.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:17.740]   It's really worth it, trust me, just wait.
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:21.860]   Hallelujah.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.540]   So God has made himself known, remember?
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.020]   Through the whole of the Exodus journey.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.740]   And in doing that, what he's done is he's delivered
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.740]   his people.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.380]   Now, what you need to understand
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.700]   is that in his delivery of his people,
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.580]   he makes himself known as well.
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.900]   So first of all, God made himself known
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.180]   to Moses at burning bush.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.020]   He delivers his people and in delivering his people,
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.580]   he further makes himself known.
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.660]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.060]   So they come to understand his character, his nature,
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.420]   by the fact that he has delivered his people, right?
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.460]   Then what God says on Mount Sinai in this moment,
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.980]   when he says, he says, I'm creating for you
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:02.180]   what's called this covenantal relationship.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.700]   Now, covenantal relationship.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.140]   Now, I'm gonna come back to this more next week
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.100]   when we have a bit more time,
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.660]   but what covenantal relationship is
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.460]   is what's about to happen on the top of Mount Sinai
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.300]   with the giving of the law and all of that.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.020]   God's saying, I've made myself known, I delivered you.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.020]   Now, out of that, I'm gonna create
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.980]   a covenantal relationship with you
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.060]   so that you can truly understand who you are.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.220]   And in this passage, he says two things for them
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.260]   about who they are.
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.900]   He says, first of all, you have to understand
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.340]   that you are what he calls priests.
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.360]   And he says, you gotta understand
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.380]   that you are also now called to be a holy nation.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:42.220]   You are priests and you are holy.
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.480]   These are the fundamental parts
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.380]   of who we are in Christ Jesus.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.860]   If you're wondering, who am I?
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:48.980]   What value do I have?
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.460]   What input can I make in the world?
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.940]   You are a priest and you are holy.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.420]   Let me break these down real quick.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.820]   Priests in the Old Testament,
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.580]   when God speaks to Israel about them being a priest,
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.740]   priests had three primary functions.
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:07.000]   Those functions were intercession, so praying,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.660]   they were invitation, helping people to come
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:15.060]   into the presence of God, and they were imitation,
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.860]   helping to show the people God's character
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.240]   by how they live their lives.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.880]   These three things, intercession, invitation,
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.780]   and imitation is what it meant to be a priest.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.900]   Priests were the mediators between God and the world.
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.380]   They would help to connect the world
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.560]   and God together through prayer.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.140]   They would pray on behalf of the world.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.860]   What we just did a moment ago
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.620]   when we prayed for the situation in the Middle East,
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.600]   we were priests together.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.540]   We were connecting God and the world together
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.820]   and saying there are needs and making that connection.
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.060]   We are to invite.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.100]   Priests set the stage for people
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.980]   to encounter their worship of God.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.540]   Christians are designed to invite people
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:52.980]   into the presence of God.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.420]   That's what we're called to do.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.100]   Imitation, the priest, we're called to show the world
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.340]   God's character by how they live their lives.
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.660]   So we as Christians are called to reveal the character
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.700]   and nature of God to everybody through how we live our lives.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.640]   Intercession, invitation, imitation is who we're called to be
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.140]   but we're also called by God as holy.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.660]   And this speaks of two areas, transformation,
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.380]   I can't spell, transformation and being set apart.
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:28.580]   It is the Holy Spirit that transforms us
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.980]   from our brokenness and our sin
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.900]   into the life that he wants us to be.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.060]   Without his spirit at work in us, in our culture,
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.140]   in our society, there is no transformation.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:40.580]   Transformation towards becoming more like Christ Jesus
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.520]   is always driven by his spirit.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.940]   So when he says, I call you holy, I bless you to be holy,
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.980]   he's inviting us into a transformative journey
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.820]   in who we are.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.060]   He sends you.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.240]   And he says, you are to be set apart.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.480]   Being holy is set apart,
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.200]   which means you should look different, be different,
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.320]   have different values to everything else
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.540]   you see in the world.
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.780]   He doesn't mean set apart in the sense that
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.440]   go up into a hill somewhere, be in a monastery
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.980]   and just act weird, okay?
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.580]   We're not supposed to be weird Christians
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.860]   but we are supposed to be set apart.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.300]   We're all supposed to have different values
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.180]   and different purposes and different hope.
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.420]   When people around us feel like they've got no hope,
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.860]   we stand up and go, there is hope.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.780]   We have a different culture, a different thinking,
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.820]   a different narrative.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.660]   And God's saying, I've created you to be set apart
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.120]   in the world, but not of the world.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.620]   I didn't call you to be out of the world
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.460]   and not of the world.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.460]   I called you to be in the world, but not of the world.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.860]   'Cause if you're in the world,
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.540]   but you're holding a different narrative,
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.940]   you're holding a different hope,
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.540]   you're holding a different lifestyle,
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.940]   you're holding different values,
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.940]   you begin to imitate my character to the world around you.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.500]   Now more than ever here in Hong Kong,
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.580]   the church has to be holy.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:55.460]   Not pious, close the doors, just worship Jesus on our own
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:56.420]   and not talk to anybody.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.780]   Holy in the sense that we're set apart
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.480]   in the city that we're planted in.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.220]   Carrying a different kind of narrative
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.860]   to the one that the world is currently hearing.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:06.820]   Are you with me?
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.520]   Anyone else passionate about that?
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.820]   And what God is saying is in these two things,
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.300]   being holy and being priests,
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.800]   we find our calling and our mission.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.780]   And next week, as we look at chapter 20,
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.820]   we'll learn a lot more about what that calling
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.260]   and that mission looks like.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.220]   But here as God speaks to them about identity change,
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.540]   he's saying, "Know who you are."
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.700]   You know who I am, do you know who you are?
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:38.340]   Paul would write this, he would say,
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:42.380]   "For we have been set free, now be free."
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:46.060]   What he's saying is now live as God has called you to live.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:49.180]   Peter, as he's pastoring the first church,
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.020]   he's trying to think,
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.300]   "How do I help them to understand who they are?
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.260]   How do I help them understand
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.140]   that they're not just being saved and that's it?"
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.380]   But there's so much more to the story.
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:01.580]   And so interestingly, Peter writes to the church
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.180]   and he actually quotes from this very chapter in Exodus 19.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.020]   Let me read this to you.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.420]   He writes this to a Jew and Gentile church.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.940]   He says, "But you are a chosen people,
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.060]   a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.740]   a people belonging to God that you might declare."
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.740]   Notice this, "You are a holy people.
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.660]   You've been chosen by God.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.600]   You are a holy people.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   You are a nation of priests, so that you might declare."
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.780]   You have a calling and mission.
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:36.300]   "So that you might declare," what he says here is,
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.900]   "The light of God.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.300]   You would declare the praises of him
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.780]   who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.300]   That you would be a mouthpiece, a voice piece
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.740]   for the incredible work that God does
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.660]   in and through us as people."
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.900]   This, my friends, is who you are.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.300]   You wanna know what your calling is?
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.480]   To be a priest, to be holy,
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.180]   so that you can declare the praises of him
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.540]   who's called you out of darkness into his glory light.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.420]   You know what you should be dedicating your life to?
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.980]   So that you could be a priest and you could be holy
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.060]   so that you could call out of the darkness
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.540]   the light of God and give him praise for who you are.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:14.580]   That's his invitation to you.
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.220]   Are you with me?
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:21.620]   If that doesn't inspire you, I don't know what will.
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:25.500]   Like if that doesn't set your heart on fire,
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.340]   if that doesn't recalibrate how you think about work,
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.420]   if that doesn't change the way that you think
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.780]   when you go into the office tomorrow
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.220]   or when you raise your kids
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.140]   or when you think about your marriage
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.740]   or you think about your future,
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.660]   if this idea of being God's mouthpiece
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.660]   and his voice and his heart to being in the world
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.940]   but not of it, to bring hope where there is no hope,
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.500]   if that doesn't inspire you, I don't know what will
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.660]   'cause this is the gospel.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:52.660]   If Exodus had finished at chapter 19,
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:56.180]   we wouldn't have gotten any of that.
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.140]   We would've just come to know him.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:04.140]   But Exodus 19 onwards is God now saying, get to know you.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:07.260]   What we're gonna be doing over the next number of weeks
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.700]   here at the Vine is helping you to live
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:14.860]   in the freedom that God has given you, amen.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.780]   Could you stand?
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.020]   I'd love to pray for you.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:24.820]   Father, we're just so grateful for the men, women,
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.380]   children and families that are here in this moment.
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:33.060]   And Father, we stand before you as a chosen people.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.900]   We stand before you as a royal priesthood,
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.500]   as a holy people.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.860]   Sometimes we don't feel that way.
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.300]   If we're honest, sometimes we don't act that way.
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.300]   It's very easy in our slavery to sin,
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.980]   to discount who it is that we've actually
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.060]   been created to be.
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:59.780]   And so a free Israel comes to Mount Sinai
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:03.500]   and God appears and he says, now the real journey begins.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.820]   (gentle music)
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.180]   It's so important that we understand
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.100]   that in the story of Exodus,
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.660]   it's not just a story of God's power
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.180]   in delivering a people without freedom.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.860]   It's a story of God's power in reviving a people
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.980]   without identity.
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.580]   And some of you in this room,
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:27.060]   you're a Christian, you love Jesus.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.420]   He saved you, you're free,
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.380]   but you struggle to know who you truly are.
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.460]   And if that's you, I wanna encourage you this morning
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.780]   just to receive from him.
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:41.180]   Receive his presence with you.
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.020]   Receive his voice over you.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.380]   You have value.
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:50.700]   And your sin and your brokenness is stripped
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.380]   so much of how you see yourself, but you have value.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.820]   I see you as a priest.
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.540]   I see you as the very one that can mediate
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:00.940]   between the world and God.
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.340]   Some of you need to know,
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:07.060]   I feel this for this service in particular,
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.420]   some of you in this room,
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.180]   because of the slavery of sin that you've been in,
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.900]   you felt anything but holy.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.180]   And we're gonna learn next week a lot more
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.620]   about what holiness really is.
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.860]   And I'm unpack that for you next week,
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.300]   but right now in this moment,
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.740]   some of you just need to know you are holy.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:30.460]   You need to know that that's how God sees you.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.740]   That's the identity he brings to you.
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:36.060]   That in his presence,
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:40.860]   we are washed clean, we are holy.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:45.420]   I feel like the enemy has stolen that thought
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.900]   from some of you in this room.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.220]   And because of that, you've held back in your decisions
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.420]   and your dreams and your hopes.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.100]   You felt like God could never really use me
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:56.060]   because of X, Y, and Z in my past.
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.700]   Israel comes to Mount Sinai
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.460]   with all of that baggage of their past,
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.340]   and God is about to tell them who they truly are.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.380]   And I pray in this moment
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.740]   and over the next number of weeks,
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.660]   you will hear who it is that you are.
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.740]   And for some of you in this room,
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.380]   God is saying, it's time to go.
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.180]   Perhaps you know who you are,
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.380]   but for whatever reason,
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.300]   you've kind of camped at Mount Sinai.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.260]   It's really important.
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.820]   Israel was at Mount Sinai for one year,
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.780]   a long time, 'cause they needed to know who they were,
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.700]   but they weren't camped at Mount Sinai forever.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.580]   Some of you, you're always seeking
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:32.980]   the mountaintop experience,
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.580]   and that's important in seasons of our life.
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.300]   But for some of you, it's time to come down the mountain,
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.460]   and it's time to get into the valley,
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.140]   and it's time to see the goodness of the Lord
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.100]   in the land of the living,
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.220]   not just on the top of the mountain.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.740]   Some of you are receiving a calling today to go.
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:54.060]   Holy Spirit, whatever it might be for whoever here,
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.180]   I just pray that you would come.
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.660]   Maybe just open your hands if you're comfortable.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.500]   I'm just gonna invite the team
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.020]   to come and just worship over us.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.260]   And as they worship over us,
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.900]   just allow yourself to be ministered to
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.580]   in whatever way that God wants to speak to you today.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.160]   (gentle music)
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:14.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
