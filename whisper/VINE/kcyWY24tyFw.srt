1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 with us, Lord. In the great name above all names, in Jesus' name we pray, the church says, amen.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:18,400
 Let's go. Thank you, worship team. Good morning, church. How are we today? Great. Good. Good to see

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,760
 you guys. Good morning. If you're in the overflow, good morning. Hello to you as well. And if you're

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,640
 joining us online, it's good to have you guys with us too. I'm a little bit still congested.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,120
 I also had sausage McMuffin for breakfast this morning. So, good life choices I'm making.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:43,600
 But again, always honored and excited to be sharing God's word this morning.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,280
 Now it's June 8th, we're halfway through 2025 already. Taxes were due last week in case you

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,280
 forgot. You still have some time, I guess. But you know, it's about these times of the year,

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,160
 we take a look back and we take stock and we start to think about how the year has been going so far

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,000
 and how we view it to go in the six months that's ahead of us. And when I think about what's been

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,760
 happening in the Sunday services and the life of this church on Sunday, at least, it's been

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,720
 really amazing to see God at work in this body of Christ, in this community. There have been so many

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,040
 moments where because we've made decisions to lean in and be obedient to how the Holy Spirit has

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,680
 been guiding us, we've had the privilege of seeing Him at work in some really cool ways.

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,280
 We've been talking about exploring the uncharted and God has been revealing through us, through

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,080
 the Holy Spirit, lots of cool things. And one of the most encouraging things I've seen is when we

17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,960
 surrender ourselves to the Holy Spirit and just let Him take over what He wants to do, especially

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,280
 in this time. I remember a few months ago, we had a time where we didn't even go into the message

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,640
 and we just continued to preach. We just, I mean, we just continue to pray and worship and minister

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:08,000
 to each other. These spontaneous responses of praise, these spontaneous responses of worship

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,160
 and celebrating in each other's joys, but also walking with each other in the burdens. And of

22
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,440
 course, one of the most beautiful things that I've seen, that we've seen is that when we've called

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,920
 upon the church to pray for each other. So the moments when we stood up, if you need prayer,

24
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,280
 open up your hands and just to see the entire body of Christ surrounding those who need prayer

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,880
 and praying over them, interceding for them, speaking on them, speaking for them on behalf

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,760
 of the pains and the needs and the feeling at that time. And it just reminds me that this is what the

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,760
 church was truly meant for. And today, as we close out our series on the Holy Spirit, we're going to

28
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,480
 be talking about the gifts of the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit. And as we talk about the

29
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,480
 gifts and the fruit, I want us to keep focusing on the body of Christ, on the church. Now this might

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,440
 be a different perspective than what we normally might think, because a lot of the time when we're

31
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,200
 talking about these things, we want to take a more sort of personal approach to it. We start asking

32
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,000
 ourselves the question, well, what is my gift, right? How am I bearing fruit? And yes, there is

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,480
 a personal element to these things. We'll talk about that in a minute. However, I think that if

34
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,440
 we think gifts and fruit are just about you or just about us as individuals, then we've missed

35
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,440
 the point completely. Something Justin said a couple of weeks ago was super important. He said

36
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,840
 that we shouldn't be like a stopping gate of the Holy Spirit, right? But he was calling us to be

37
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,360
 more like conduits and allow the Holy Spirit to work through us, to flow through us. And this is

38
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:59,760
 exactly what the gifts and the fruit is all about. In other words, the Holy Spirit does not give you

39
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:08,080
 gifts and fruit for your personal benefit. The Holy Spirit doesn't give you gifts and fruit to

40
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,320
 make you look good, right? The Holy Spirit doesn't empower us with wisdom so that people will look up

41
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,680
 to you and say, wow, this person is so insightful, so full of knowledge. The Holy Spirit does not

42
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,560
 give you healing so that people can start looking to you to make them healthy of their sickness and

43
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,240
 diseases, infirmities, evil spirits, whatever it is, right? The Holy Spirit doesn't give us patience

44
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,160
 and kindness so that people will say, wow, this is what a good, virtuous person looks like. No,

45
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,360
 the gifts and the fruit are given to us so that the whole entire church, the entire body of Christ

46
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,760
 can come together and say, praise the Lord. The gifts and the fruit being made known among us.

47
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,520
 So people look and say, this is what it looks like when a group of people are worshipping in spirit

48
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,600
 and in truth. The fruit and the gifts and the fruit are given to us so that people can truly

49
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,160
 say, this is God's word being revealed and lived out in this kingdom. This is the kingdom of heaven

50
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,400
 on earth. The gifts and the fruit are given to us so those of us who are tired of our sin can truly

51
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,040
 come to a safe place where conviction and confession and repentance is embraced in our community.

52
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:30,080
 In other words, it's not about you. Now, I know this sounds a bit harsh, but we really need to

53
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,440
 be careful when we come to the gifts and the fruit so we take the right approach. Because when we

54
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,480
 look at the world, the worldly focus, right? It's so focused on making life about us. The world is

55
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,800
 really good at putting people up on pedestals, glorifying individuals for their gifts and their

56
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,360
 talents. And as a result, we have this sort of weird celebrity culture where people just do so,

57
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,880
 there's such effort and motivation for people just to do something, to go viral, become famous so

58
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,320
 people can look up to them in some sort of way. There are people out there with followers on

59
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,400
 Instagram, more than entire countries. If you go to see some of these celebrities, there's like

60
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,680
 hundreds of millions of followers, more than big countries combined, right? Something that's totally

61
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,880
 not cool one day, right? Just takes one person of influence to do something and then everybody

62
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,040
 wants a piece of that action. We spend time, money, effort going to shows and concerts for

63
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,680
 our favorite music, artists and bands. I'm not saying don't go to those things. I'm just saying

64
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,120
 be careful. Because when we lift up people so much and look at their talent so much, we sometimes

65
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,560
 even casually call them, "Oh, these people are like our idols." But what does the Bible say about

66
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,800
 idols, Church? Now, I'm sounding like a party pooper here, okay? "Ellison, where's your funny

67
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,720
 story for this message?" Okay, I don't have one today. I'm sorry. Okay. What I'm saying is, I've

68
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,200
 been saying it, we need to be really, really careful not to let that sort of thinking seep in

69
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,680
 to the body of Christ. Because when it comes to things like the gifts and the fruit of the Spirit,

70
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,680
 especially when we're talking about the gifts in the Church, we too can very easily find ourselves

71
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,000
 lifting up people who we see as gifted, rather than lifting up the name of Jesus. And instead

72
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,680
 for the Church benefiting for the gifts and the fruits, all the benefits and all the recognition

73
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,400
 goes to certain individuals, certain gifts, certain people, right? We've even developed this

74
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,320
 weird like celebrity, past and celebrity worship leader subculture that exists in this thing that

75
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,920
 we call Christianity, where honestly, sometimes it's really hard to say, "Are we lifting up Jesus'

76
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,680
 name or are we lifting up this person's name?" We're like, "Who are we actually praising here?"

77
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:59,200
 Thank you, Tony. But the Bible has a very different perspective, right? Let's look at 1

78
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,880
 Corinthians 12 together. There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them.

79
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,720
 There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working,

80
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:20,000
 but in all of them and in everyone, it is the same God at work. Now to each one, the manifestation

81
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,080
 is given for the, let's say those last two words together, for the common good, right?

82
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,400
 There's this beautiful theological truth that Paul is declaring with these words,

83
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,160
 but the point being made is that the gifts, that everyone's gifts are different,

84
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:43,200
 but it doesn't mean that one is considered to be better than the other. Why? Well, precisely what

85
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,440
 we've been saying, the gifts are given to us, not for you, us as individuals, but for the sake of

86
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:57,280
 unity, for the sake of the common good. In fact, the way that these gifts are given reflect the

87
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:04,480
 unity that we see in the God that we worship, the Father and Son of the Holy Spirit. Look how Paul

88
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,000
 phrases the passage. There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. Different kinds of

89
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,920
 service, but the same Lord. In everyone, it's different, but it's the same God at work. Holy

90
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,880
 Spirit, Lord Jesus, Father God, all working in unity together to give us the gifts so that the

91
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,360
 church can also reflect and display the same unity that we see in Yahweh that we worship.

92
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,080
 Time and time and time again, the Bible gives a very clear message. So I'll say it again, church.

93
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:45,520
 It's not about you. It's not about us. Now, again, that's not to say that we cannot honor

94
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,520
 and recognize people at all. They are indeed people who are recognized for the amazing

95
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,000
 things that they have done. And we need to give honor and credit where credit is due.

96
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,320
 There's people that I look up to in my life and I think very highly about. People who I think would

97
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,000
 be really cool to be like that one day. People I've met within this community. I mean, Tony voiced up

98
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,320
 just now, but when I'm Tony's age and I'm half as effortlessly cool as Tony is, I know I've made it

99
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,200
 in life. Right. Tony is a hero of mine. I have Instagram. You know, I scroll through Instagram.

100
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,720
 I follow certain people. I'm inspired by the things that they do. And even within this community,

101
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,680
 right, apart from the obvious things that you see on the stage, right, if we were to get to know the

102
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:39,440
 people around you, you would know that there is a group of really incredibly gifted people in this

103
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,960
 room. On a staff level, on a volunteers, we have the best worship team in town. Facts. I don't care

104
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,800
 where church you're from. Okay. We have the best worship team in town. Facts. Okay. We have some

105
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,920
 of the best preaching and teaching in town. Okay. Facts. These are just facts. Okay. You can come at

106
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:05,920
 me if you want. Okay. But the people around us, the community that makes up this church, you'll

107
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,040
 see that the Holy Spirit has given all kinds of gifts to all kinds of people. If we look at the

108
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,160
 scripture, Paul says it like this, "To one that's given through the Spirit a message of wisdom,

109
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,240
 to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, to another faith in the same Spirit,

110
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,120
 to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy,

111
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,000
 to another distinguishing spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to

112
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 another the interpretation of tongues." There's several other places where we can find a list of

113
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,560
 spiritual gifts, right? This is not an exhaustive list, and we don't have time to go through each

114
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,480
 and every single of these ones specifically today. But there are a couple of things I want us to

115
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,600
 notice as we look through things like this. Firstly, it's this, they are given to us. They

116
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:04,320
 are given to us through the Spirit. You don't earn these gifts by being extra super holy, right? You

117
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,680
 can't buy them with money. These gifts are God's way of working through us, equipping us, encouraging

118
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:19,840
 us, using us for the sake of His kingdom and His glory, right? They are God's idea. They are a

119
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:26,880
 blessing from God, and God loves giving us gifts. Bible tells us specifically that God is the best

120
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,240
 giver of gifts, and that every good and perfect gift comes from our loving Father in heaven.

121
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,200
 So they're given to us. It's a gift. We don't earn it. And also, as you see, there are many of them.

122
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,160
 It's a long list. And like I said, it's not the only list. There's a variety of gifts and functions,

123
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,880
 and that's a good thing. That's the beautiful thing. So therefore, your gift in the Holy Spirit,

124
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,480
 it's not your supernatural, not your superpower made for everybody to look at you. Your gift

125
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:08,880
 is your part in the body of Christ. This means that unless you're using your gift to serve the

126
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:16,240
 Lord, to serve the community of Christ, to serve the body of Christ, the church cannot be all that

127
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:24,800
 God meant for it to be. Paul will say it like this in Romans 12. "For just as each of us has one body

128
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:31,520
 with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ, though many

129
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,040
 form one body, and each member belongs to the others. We have different gifts according to the

130
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:44,720
 grace given to us." If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith.

131
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,040
 If it's serving, then serve. If it's teaching, then teach. If it's to encourage, then give

132
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,400
 encouragement. If it's giving, then give generously. If it's to lead, do it diligently. If

133
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:04,080
 it's to show mercy, do it cheerfully. Everybody needs to pitch in because every single person in

134
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:12,080
 this room, the Bible tells us, has a gift. And therefore, you have a role to play. Again, this

135
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,280
 is important to keep in mind because the danger is, especially when it comes to spiritual gifts,

136
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,240
 we start to see some gifts as better than the others. Which means that some people think that

137
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,680
 they're more important than they actually are, and some people end up thinking they underestimate

138
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,920
 the crucial part that they are to play in God's kingdom. So for example, what's happening right

139
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,240
 here? People being on the stage, speaking, teaching, singing, whatever it is to people

140
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,120
 all throughout the day, right? This is a gift that's often lifted up and seen as highly important.

141
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,560
 But what about the gift of serving? What about the people that held the signs that served you

142
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,160
 by greeting you on the way up to the auditorium this morning? What about the team of hosts that

143
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,120
 passed from the offering buckets just now? What about the communion we're about to take later

144
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,920
 that people had to come in at 7 a.m. this morning to tear up the pieces of bread, to fill up the

145
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,560
 little cups, just so that we can have communion later? Did it cross your mind that our greeters

146
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,560
 and hosts and volunteers play just as critical a part in the body of Christ than the preacher or

147
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,160
 the worship team when it comes to our Sunday services? And I'm just talking about Sunday

148
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,400
 services here. Right, without people who are willing to use the gifts of serving the church,

149
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,360
 none of this would be possible, guys. None. There would be no production team,

150
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,880
 the band would be one or two people, there would be no kids and youth ministry,

151
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:46,720
 this whole place would be in chaos. But God in His infinite wisdom, in His perfect knowledge

152
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,880
 of His children, in His generosity, He looks at a group like us and then through the Holy Spirit,

153
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:00,640
 He distributes gifts and expects everyone to use their gifts and play their part so that the whole

154
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:07,440
 church can function healthily. This is what He's talking about. Again, let's go back to Scripture.

155
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:16,080
 God has put the body together so that there should be no division in the body, but all the parts have

156
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:23,600
 equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it. If one part is honored,

157
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,320
 every part rejoices with it. You see, from a worldly perspective, right, when we get gifts,

158
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,440
 when we give gifts or get gifts, it is something quite personal, right? And you get it with that

159
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,440
 person in mind. Well, hopefully you spare some thought, right? That's a nice thing to do,

160
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,160
 right? To think about that person and get them a gift, right? Birthday, anniversaries, graduations.

161
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,840
 You think about the need, right? And you get something tailored for that person.

162
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,720
 And then when that person receives a gift, there is no expectation to share it.

163
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,600
 I mean, you wouldn't get, you know, if I bought Nathan a new pair of shoes, I would say something

164
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,520
 like, "Okay, hey, you know, those new Jordans are pretty cool, but you have to let me wear them on

165
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,360
 Mondays and Wednesdays, okay?" Apart from the fact they wouldn't fit, it doesn't make sense.

166
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:14,240
 That's not how gifts work. But when it comes to spiritual gifts, the perspective is different.

167
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,800
 So yes, the personal element is still there. Again, not everyone has the same gift,

168
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,440
 which means when God looks at you as His child, as the person who He knitted together in His

169
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,360
 mother's womb, your God who knows the amount of hairs on your head, He saw you and He gave you a

170
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,480
 gift specifically through the Holy Spirit with you in mind, with His wisdom, with His love,

171
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,760
 with His grace. And when we receive this gift from God, right, there is a sense of closeness

172
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:51,040
 and intimacy that we feel with the Father and He draws us closer to Him. The thing is after we

173
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:57,680
 receive that, they are then meant to be shared. These gifts are designed for us to use to help

174
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,880
 those around us. For example, healing is a gift. But I mean, there's only so much healing you can

175
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,960
 do on yourself, right? And then God gives you the gift of healing so that you can have mercy to

176
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,560
 those around you who are in need. He gives you the gift of faith so that when you see someone

177
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,280
 struggling in their season of life, you can come alongside them, say, "I will pray with you. I will

178
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:29,120
 walk with you. Let's do this together." That's a gift of faith. All these gifts that we get only

179
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,080
 make sense when they're shared amongst the church. So if you find yourself with these gifts,

180
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,400
 the question we should be asking ourselves is not, "How is this gift going to benefit me?"

181
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,240
 That's worldly, fleshly thinking. That's a mistake that dude made when he said to Peter,

182
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,040
 and if you could buy the gift that he saw, that he saw Peter had with money. But what was his

183
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,520
 response? "May your money perish with you because you thought you could buy the gift of God with

184
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:05,680
 money. You have no part or share in this ministry because your heart is not right before God."

185
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:14,000
 So let me remind us again, these gifts of the Spirit are given for the common good.

186
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,040
 You see what I'm beginning, you understand what I'm saying now? That it's not about you.

187
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,200
 It's not for one person to stand out at the star, but these gifts are given to us to highlight just

188
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:34,400
 how much God wants us to serve and to need each other. So this presents a question and a challenge

189
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:42,160
 to all of us. What is our gift? And once you discover your gift, how are you using it to serve

190
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:49,200
 the body of Christ, to serve the Lord, to serve the church? Because like I said, everyone has a

191
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,800
 role to play. And I'll just say it plainly, right? Showing up on a Sunday is not a spiritual gift.

192
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:03,520
 Right? It's not. But do you know your part? Are you playing your part? Listen, okay,

193
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,080
 everybody is welcome here. If you want to just keep coming, we will never turn you away. We

194
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:15,680
 will always, you will always be welcome here. However, if you've been here a minute and your

195
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:22,000
 plan is just to keep coming to church on Sunday and nothing else, you're really missing out on

196
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,480
 the full picture of what it means to be part of a body of Christ, to be a Christian, to be a follower

197
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,400
 of Jesus. Right? And this isn't a guilt trip because we need volunteers for JCA and VBS.

198
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,560
 All right. I'm not, I'm just saying what the Bible is teaching us. Okay. It's not.

199
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:49,280
 So if you don't know the question, you know, how do I find my spiritual gift? Again, it's a good

200
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,080
 question. And we can talk about this all day. Let me just give a few practical pointers in this

201
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,800
 direction. First of all, okay. Don't treat it like an enneagram or a disc or a Myers-Briggs,

202
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,600
 one of those personality tests, that kind of stuff. Okay. Your spiritual gift is not a personality

203
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,720
 test. All right. I mean, there are online tools that might be useful, but I wouldn't even start

204
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,280
 there necessarily. The first step to finding out your part and your gift in the body of Christ is

205
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,320
 to seek God first. Seek first the kingdom and all these other things will then be given to you.

206
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,320
 Right? This means reading your Bible. This means prayer and fasting. This means constant

207
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,800
 confession and repentance. This means developing and nurturing your relationship with Jesus.

208
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:43,360
 That's the first basic step. The second step was this, right? When you're following Jesus,

209
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,440
 when you feel, when you know that your heart and the desires of your heart have been made pure,

210
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,240
 then you ask, ask the Holy Spirit to show you, where do you want me to serve?

211
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:02,720
 What is the gift that you've given me? What is my part in the body of Christ? As scripture tells us,

212
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:10,080
 then when we do that, if we ask anything according to his will, he will hear us.

213
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:17,040
 One good way to ask is to ask those around you, the people that you trust around you. The other

214
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,960
 people that you know are also in the same journey of following Jesus. Find a community that you

215
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,080
 trust. Talk to people, come along them and say, "Hey, you know, I feel like God has given me a

216
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,440
 gift in whatever. Do you see that in me?" Or maybe ask one of your leaders at the church or whatever,

217
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,960
 say, "I feel like I have the gift of this. Is there something that you've noticed in me that

218
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:46,080
 you see in me?" Ask, ask the Lord, ask those around you. Thirdly is this, be content.

219
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,360
 So, you know, in those, in the early stages of singing competitions, right? Like Britain's Got

220
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,760
 Talent, all that kind of stuff, right? In the audition stages, there's always these people who

221
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,360
 show up, right, full of confidence, thinking they're like the songbird of their generation.

222
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,200
 But in reality, when they start to sing, right, it's not that good, right? And you end up with,

223
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,840
 you know, that the Ken dibby dibby doubt you lady, right? Like you think you have this talent

224
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,480
 and your gift to sing, but actually that's not your gift. And somewhere along the way,

225
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,160
 there've been disillusion or someone has lied to them. You know, maybe they sang in front of their

226
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,400
 mom and the mom's like, "Oh yeah, yeah, you're really good. You're good at everything, son. Okay.

227
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,840
 And you go off, yeah, go do it, do the audition." And you find out actually that's not what you're

228
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:38,240
 good at. In the same way, right? The Bible does say, ask, earnestly ask and desire the gifts.

229
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,560
 But it also tells us that everything must be done so that the church may be built up.

230
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,960
 So whatever the Holy Spirit has decided to bless you with, trust Him with that, lean into that.

231
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,120
 Again, I'm not saying you can't ask, you can't desire, do those things. The Holy Spirit might

232
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,960
 choose to work in you in that way at some time, but whatever God has given to you,

233
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,520
 trust Him with that, lean into that and serve and work out of that so that when the Spirit is at

234
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:18,000
 work in your life, He can give you the gift to serve the body of Christ. Now that's a gift of

235
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,160
 the Spirit, the gifts of the Spirit. But the Spirit at work in your life should also grow

236
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:29,360
 fruit within you. Well, what's the difference? Well, I would say probably that you can look at

237
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,920
 it like this. Gifts are normally for certain times and certain seasons and certain moments.

238
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,680
 Right. For example, tongues again is described as one of the spiritual gifts, right? Every now and

239
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,680
 then in the worship service at the Vine, right, we'll have a gift of tongues and there'll be

240
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:52,160
 interpretation and, you know, the whole church is strengthened and edified by the gift of tongues.

241
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,080
 But if that were to happen constantly, every day, all the time, right, we wouldn't be able to get

242
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,640
 on to anything else, right? Healing again is certain gifts for certain moments. Every now

243
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,320
 and then we get called to pray for those who are sick and we see healing take place. We've seen

244
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,920
 some very powerful ways the Holy Spirit has worked and healed people from all sorts of things.

245
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:22,000
 But again, there's a certain time and place for that. That's not to mean that the Holy Spirit

246
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,560
 can't heal when we pray. It just means that the Holy Spirit is choosing not to act in that way

247
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:37,040
 for that particular moment. But when it comes to the fruit, the fruit isn't something that we see

248
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,040
 every now and then. The fruit of the Spirit is something we constantly need to be growing in.

249
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:50,400
 This is why Paul says, "Walk by the Spirit." The word walk here isn't talking about like a

250
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:57,120
 stroll down the beach or a stroll in the park. It's talking about how you live your life,

251
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,880
 the choices you make. And we need to be really careful about this because again,

252
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,240
 the consequences are serious. Galatians 5, check out what Paul has to say.

253
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,360
 "Walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what

254
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,560
 is contrary to the Spirit and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict

255
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:31,280
 with each other so that you are not to do whatever you want. Walk by the Spirit and you will not

256
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:39,040
 gratify the desires of the flesh." It's very clear. Paul's very clear. Scripture's very clear. We've

257
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,880
 felt this too, right? There's a constant battle going on inside of us, outside of us between what

258
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,360
 the flesh wants and where the Spirit is trying to lead us towards. And here's the thing, right?

259
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:58,240
 The Bible tells us we can't just do whatever we want and call it freedom. It's a bit sort of

260
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,680
 contradictory because if we're being told how to live, right, on one level that sounds more like a

261
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:09,600
 restriction rather than freedom. But what does freedom in this case actually look like? What

262
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,360
 does freedom in Christ actually look like? Because we talk about freedom a lot. One of the great

263
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,280
 benefits of Christianity and the life in Jesus is freedom. Again, we sing about it, we preach about

264
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:27,600
 it, we proclaim Bible verses about freedom. "Who the Son sets free is free indeed." Yes and amen.

265
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,160
 But what are we talking about when we talk about freedom? Well, from the worldly, fleshly perspective,

266
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:41,200
 freedom is the ability to say and think and do and act whatever you like, right? A life with no

267
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,200
 limits and no control. This is how kids think, right? Kids look up to us, our children look up

268
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,840
 to us and they think, "Oh, I can't wait till I'm an adult so I can eat ice cream all day. I can

269
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,760
 melt my brain with TV, you know, and I can just buy any toy I want anytime I want." Right? That is how

270
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,840
 a kid looks at us, right? And see, well, freedom is to be able to do whatever we want anytime we want.

271
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:12,400
 But even as adults, right, we tend to look at freedom in this way. A life of freedom is if, well,

272
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,360
 I can live on my own terms, right? Isn't that what the world approves of? You deserve it.

273
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,520
 Live life on your own terms, do whatever you want, be free, don't let anybody hold you down. You only

274
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:31,120
 live once, right? So come on, just go for it. Do it. Doesn't matter. Now, life this way might sound

275
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:39,680
 appealing. The only problem is God's Word tells us something quite different. And Scripture warns us

276
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:46,480
 that freedom in the flesh will lead us to some dark places. Places filled with things like sexual

277
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:56,560
 immorality, impurity and debauchery, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,

278
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:03,520
 selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, and envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you,

279
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,600
 as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.

280
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:17,360
 When you read to that list, you know what it sounds like to me? It sounds like chaos and disorder.

281
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,440
 Right? That sounds like everyone out for themselves, not caring about those around them.

282
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:31,600
 That list sounds like darkness and hatred and evil. It's the road to destruction and

283
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,000
 eternal separation from God. Freedom in the flesh is not true freedom.

284
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,640
 Firstly, it goes against who you were created to be, right? Because you were created to be a human

285
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:55,360
 being that glorifies himself or herself. You were created to be an image bearer of God. This means

286
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,960
 that you feel your sense and your purpose, not when you're out doing whatever you want, but when

287
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,080
 your life is fully obedient to what Jesus has called you to. That is when you feel most alive.

288
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,240
 That is when you're going to feel most free. That is when you're going to realize what your purpose,

289
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:20,240
 your destiny, whatever word you want to use in life is. Second thing is this, you end up in a

290
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:27,040
 terrible place. Paul says it clearly that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom

291
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:34,240
 of God. You will have no part in what God's trying to do in this life or the next. In other words,

292
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:42,000
 you are separated from God now and for all eternity. And free living that leads to chaos

293
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,160
 and separation from God is not freedom at all. Remember what Pastor Andrew said at the beginning

294
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:57,680
 of this series, that the Holy Spirit is what brings order out of chaos. And this is what he

295
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:03,280
 wants to do in the body of Christ in our lives. And Paul is about to give us one of the most

296
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:09,600
 beautiful examples of what a life of order in the Holy Spirit looks like. I would say that this is

297
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,360
 one of the most beautiful pictures of order and of peace and of the way God wants us to live outside

298
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:22,960
 of Genesis 1. Genesis 1, we have Eden and it's perfect. This is an echo of what God has talked

299
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:31,120
 to us about in Genesis 1. Listen to what the Bible says. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,

300
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:38,400
 peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

301
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:47,760
 Against such things, there is no law. Doesn't this sound a lot more like peace and order?

302
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,560
 Doesn't this sound like the things we want to chase in life? Isn't this what you hope you've

303
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:02,720
 been created for? Now, there is an important detail to note. And this is important because

304
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,600
 this verse is so well known. Sometimes as Christians, when it comes to this, we like to do

305
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,960
 like a little stock index exchange on this passage. And we begin to think like, "Oh, well, you know,

306
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,640
 I wasn't very kind today, but I did have peace about it." Or, "Well, you know, I didn't show

307
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:26,400
 much self-control, but you know, there was a lot of joy." Right? It doesn't, don't do this. Okay?

308
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,760
 Doesn't make sense. Right? The fruit of the Spirit is not your stock portfolio. Right? You can't,

309
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,320
 like, if you have lots of gains in one, it doesn't cover the losses in the other. You know what I'm

310
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,200
 saying? Right? Can you really be faithful without being patient? Right? Is there real joy without

311
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,560
 having peace? Right? There's a simple thing. You might already know this. I'm going to remind us,

312
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:56,960
 right? It's not the fruits of the Spirit. It's the fruit, singular, of the Spirit. Right? If you've

313
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,520
 not heard that before, write it down in your margins. Okay? The fruit of the Spirit. And if

314
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,160
 we're going to grow in the fruit, if we're going to walk by the Spirit, then we're going to have to

315
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:16,400
 dedicate every part of ourselves in this journey. And again, it's not an easy one.

316
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:23,840
 The true Christian life, if we're really to follow Jesus with everything we have,

317
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:31,600
 it's not the easy path to choose. It's the narrow path. Because like we said, your Spirit and your

318
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,880
 flesh are constantly going to be at conflict with each other. There isn't a version of following

319
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,000
 Jesus where we just get to coast and sail off into the sunset, not giving a thought to how we're

320
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,280
 actually supposed to live our lives. No, but it's a life of discipline. Paul calls it, it's a

321
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:56,960
 training up for godliness. Fruit takes time and effort to grow, right? You can't just plonk a tree

322
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,560
 in some soil and just expect it to do its thing. It takes nurturing. It takes watering. It takes

323
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:08,080
 nutrients. It takes protection from the elements and other insects. It takes pruning and grafting

324
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:14,160
 and all that kind of stuff. It just doesn't happen automatically. Which is why in your Christian life,

325
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:21,600
 it's always going to be about choosing God's way instead of your way. Your old self with its

326
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,200
 attraction to chaos and sin, full of passion and the desires of the flesh, is always going to try

327
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:34,160
 and draw you back to that place of chaos. The enemy and the devil and his minions and the enemy

328
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,680
 of this world is always trying to use temptation to draw you back into that place of separation

329
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:48,960
 from God, of living life without the Holy Spirit. This is why we've been saying, we need to deal

330
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,680
 with sin seriously. And when we made the decision to follow Jesus, it means also identifying with

331
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:01,280
 him in death, which means that our sinful desires, the thing we used to follow in this world, have

332
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,400
 been crucified to the cross with Jesus. There is no space for that in our walk with the Holy Spirit

333
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:18,240
 now. Okay, again, take a deep breath because it sounds like a lot of pressure. The good news is

334
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:26,160
 that you don't, or even you cannot do this by your own power. And that's good news.

335
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:35,360
 And just as the gifts are from the Holy Spirit, the ability to put your flesh to death,

336
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:42,160
 to grow in the fruit, to walk with the Spirit, that is also something that the Holy Spirit has

337
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:49,680
 to empower you in. Right? It's repeated multiple times in this passage. We need to be led by the

338
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:56,000
 Spirit. We need to walk by the Spirit. We need to live by the Spirit. We need to keep in step with

339
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,080
 the Spirit. The Spirit is there to guide, to lead, to hold, to draw you back, to push you forward,

340
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:09,040
 to help you live this Christian life. And just like we rely on the Holy Spirit to give us our

341
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,840
 spiritual gifts, in the same way, the Holy Spirit helps us to live lives that will bear fruit.

342
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:26,080
 Now again, this is not self-help. Okay? This isn't about making yourself a better person,

343
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:31,040
 self-improvement. It's not about becoming more virtuous so people can look at you a certain way.

344
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,840
 This is about dealing with your sin so that you can have a living, working, convicting, obedient

345
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:45,760
 life, eternity-changing relationship with Jesus. And He is the one who helps you through it.

346
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,920
 "Remain in me," He says, "as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself.

347
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,840
 It must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me."

348
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:05,040
 A life totally reliant and connected to our Savior, to the whole and to the Holy Spirit.

349
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,360
 This is what true freedom looks like.

350
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:20,160
 And when we live this way, it tells us there is no law. Right? God's never going to stop you from

351
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,480
 growing in the fruit of the Spirit. No government or authority is ever going to say, "Stop doing

352
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,400
 these things." Right? "These are good, virtuous, amazing things." Right? No, nothing will ever

353
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,160
 stop you from growing in the Spirit. There is no law against these things.

354
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:42,480
 And so once you've had the fruit, you've tasted and seen that the fruit of the Spirit is good,

355
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:50,560
 you will begin living in a way that brings true life to yourself and to those around you.

356
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,240
 And as difficult as it may be at times, you will never want to stop growing in them.

357
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,120
 The gifts and the fruit, therefore, go hand in hand.

358
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:12,000
 You are being called to build up the kingdom of God here on earth as it is in heaven.

359
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,200
 But you're also being called to live lives of holiness and closeness that reflect God's heart

360
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:28,720
 and who He is. And God expects both His followers to use their gifts and to bear fruit.

361
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:36,000
 This is Pentecost Sunday, and this is exactly what happens on the day of Pentecost when the

362
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,480
 Holy Spirit first fell upon the followers. This is a beautiful picture of gifts and fruit coming

363
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,360
 together when the early church is first established. Acts 2.43 tells us this, that when the

364
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:54,400
 Holy Spirit came, everybody was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs being performed by

365
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,240
 the apostles. These are the spiritual gifts that were tongues, healing, all these things that the

366
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,120
 apostles began to minister to other people out of the gifts that the Holy Spirit had given to them.

367
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:11,280
 But then it goes on to tell us this, that all the believers together had everything in common.

368
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,000
 They sold property and possessions and gave to anyone in need. They continued to meet together

369
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,400
 in temple courts, broke bread, ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying

370
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,080
 the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to the number daily those who are being saved.

371
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:37,440
 This is the fruit of the Spirit beginning to grow. Gifts and fruit. That's how the Holy Spirit has

372
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,880
 always wanted to work, has always been working, and how He desires to continue to work today.

373
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,320
 So I'm going to ask everybody to stand. If you're able to stand, please join me in standing.

374
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,880
 And through communion right now, we're going to respond to what God wants us,

375
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,960
 to however God wants us to respond. Our hosts are going to hand out a piece of bread to you.

376
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,680
 When you get the piece of bread, just hold it in your hand because we're going to take it together

377
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:19,440
 in just a moment. But as you hold the bread, you know, the bread, the church tells us, is a symbol

378
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:28,480
 of the body of Christ that was given and broken for us. That God came down to earth as Jesus

379
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:38,480
 and chose to serve. And one of the most beautiful pictures of unity we see is Jesus with His

380
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:47,920
 disciples. And before Jesus shared this meal, He got down on His hands and His feet and washed

381
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,120
 His disciples' feet, showing them that this is what it's like to be a servant. This is what I'm

382
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:03,120
 calling you to. And so as you hold the bread in your hand, have that conversation with the Holy

383
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:12,000
 Spirit right now. Ask Him, "What is my gift and how am I to serve you with what you've gifted me with?"

384
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,960
 Just hold on to this bread and I will take it together in just a minute.

385
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:30,400
