[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   So right now I want to invite up Pastor Chapman.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.880]   Let's give him a warm welcome.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.960]   Yes.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.000]   Love this guy.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.240]   Hey, so excited.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.600]   He today, he did double duty.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.720]   He's preaching, preaching Cantonese.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.040]   Now he's going to switch to English.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.080]   I hope.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.040]   Yeah, maybe if he feels like it.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.060]   Yeah, but let's, let's pray for Chapman.
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.200]   Let's pray for us as we prepare our hearts so you can stretch out your hands towards
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   him and let me pray for us.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   Jesus, thank you so much for Chapman and his love for you, his love for your word, his
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.600]   desire to proclaim you.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.440]   And I pray that you would powerfully would speak through him today as the words that
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.520]   you have given him for us, that you will move by your Holy Spirit and that we will, yeah,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.160]   have what we, what I said earlier, that, that we are here with a purpose because you want
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.000]   to speak to us and that you would speak to us and that you will bring life and change
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.440]   and freedom through the words that Chapman preaches.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.040]   So pray for also your Holy Spirit anointing and blessing on him and strengthen energy
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.040]   and pray all this in your name, Jesus.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040]   Amen.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.040]   Amen.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.040]   Thank you, Pastor Tim.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.040]   Can we put a hand together for Pastor Tim?
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.760]   Ah, summer holidays.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.000]   Anyone enjoying summer right now?
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Anyone here?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   No.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   One or two of you.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Okay, that's good.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   That's good enough.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.560]   So summer holiday, we always have mixed feelings, right?
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.880]   If you're a student, you know, it's the most wonderful time in the year.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.880]   If you're a parent, that means you start to, okay, what I'm going to do with my kid during
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.880]   summer.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.680]   For me, I was a bit, I can't say I'm lucky, but my wife and my daughters, they're actually
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.680]   in Singapore.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.240]   They've been in Singapore for a week.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:00.240]   So I lived on my own for a week and it feels very strange.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.320]   She's listening, okay?
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.320]   So better don't say that.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.640]   I think she's watching.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.280]   I just feel very awkward.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.760]   I haven't been living a single life for a very long time.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.440]   And you can imagine the dishes that pile up in my kitchen, laundry.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.160]   Okay, I did my laundry yesterday.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.560]   But anyway, beginning of summer, I still remember when I was primary five.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.320]   The week before summer holiday started, I was 11 years old back then.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.240]   So in school, we normally, in local schools, we call it the post-exam period.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.160]   Basically there's no class.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.480]   Teacher's not going to teach anymore.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.700]   We're just freely like have fun.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.520]   So we bring all kinds of chess, Uno, Jenga, everything that we're going to enjoy this
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.040]   afternoon with the youth group, we did it during that period of time, post-exam period.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.240]   So that was really the most exciting time of the year for students.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:06.080]   Until one particular morning, my teacher, she brought a whole pile of books into the
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.160]   room and she started distributing them.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.680]   And if you're like me, you grew up in a local school system, every summer we got something
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680]   to do.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.080]   That's a summer holiday workbook.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.000]   What an oxymoron.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.560]   The most evil invention ever in human history, you know?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   That's not right.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.560]   That's injustice.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.680]   Imagine, I'm not joking, imagine this.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.800]   Imagine you're going to start your annual leave tomorrow and today your boss call you
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.560]   up and give you work to do.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.240]   What will you say?
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.600]   That's injustice, right?
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.320]   That's the most evil invention ever in human history, period.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.280]   So that summer, I made up my mind.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.960]   I said, I'm not going to let this book, this 80-page book ruin my freedom, the joy of my
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   freedom in the summer holiday.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.840]   So as soon as that book landed on my desk, I turn it over, I flip over, I wrote my name
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.160]   down and then I flip another page and I started writing on it.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.400]   By the end of that school day, like before I went home, I finished 20 pages of that book.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.720]   But I didn't stop there because my goal is to enjoy the freedom of my summer.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.980]   I'm not going to let my parents tell me, "Hey, have you finished your summer homework?"
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.920]   I'm going to enjoy it.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.440]   So within one or two days, I just keep doing it, keep doing it, and I finished the entire
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.800]   book before summer holiday even started.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.040]   So I was so excited that evening when my dad came back from work.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.680]   I was just so eager to tell him I was expecting a little bit of compliment.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.760]   So I said, "Dad, I finished the entire summer workbook."
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.800]   And this is what he said, "Oh, what?
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.840]   You finished your entire summer holiday workbook?
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.280]   Then what are you going to do throughout the summer?"
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.440]   I guess now I'm going to go buy some more exercise for you.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.320]   Within a split second, one of my greatest achievement by far in my 11 years of life
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.960]   has turned into one of my greatest mistakes in life.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.840]   Freedom, right?
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.800]   We all want freedom.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.520]   Freedom is something that is encoded in our human DNA.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.240]   Can I get an amen for that?
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.080]   Who doesn't love freedom, right?
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.240]   Even my one and a half year old daughter, she understands what is freedom or she demonstrates
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.880]   her eager desire for freedom.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.440]   Whenever I'm holding Mabel, she will struggle.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.280]   She will want to get down and run around.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.320]   Whenever she's done with dinner, the first thing she does is to try to get rid of her
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.080]   harness or the seatbelt and try to get down, jump off the chair.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.480]   Even a one and a half year old baby, they understand the idea of freedom, which is the
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:09.120]   absence of any external constraints or interference that limits one's actions or choices.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.800]   For my one year old, the external constraint is actually that seatbelt or sometimes her
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.720]   father's arms.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.040]   For an 11 year old version of me, that external constraint was actually that 80 page summer
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:30.120]   holiday workbook that is restricting me from enjoying the freedom of my summer holiday.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.280]   I'm sure many of us in this room, I'm sure in different stages, different periods of
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.320]   life, we all face certain external constraints or interference in life that are limiting
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.600]   your choices or limiting your actions.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.080]   Something like maybe you have very long working hours that is restricting you from really
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.360]   getting a life, affecting your work-life balance.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:03.480]   Or maybe it's an economic external constraint, which could be a debt or could be a health
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:12.300]   constraint such as an illness, be it physical or mental, or it could be expectations coming
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.240]   from your family, coming from your friends, your bosses, your colleagues, or even social
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:24.400]   norms or discriminations that you want to get rid of, you want to be set free from.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:34.000]   As human beings, we face different external constraints in our lives and we desire freedom.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.920]   More precisely, we desire freedom from all these constraints.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.920]   So a political philosopher, his name is Isaiah Berlin, he described this kind of freedom,
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.280]   namely the freedom from something.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.060]   He called it, this absence of external constraints, he called it a negative freedom.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.120]   So don't worry, the use of the word negative doesn't imply it's a bad thing.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.720]   It simply points to the fact that there indeed is another kind of freedom in human life.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.320]   And yes, you would have guessed it, it's called positive freedom.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.200]   While negative freedom, it's a freedom from something, positive freedom, on the other
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.280]   hand, is the freedom to do something, to achieve something.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:24.780]   It goes beyond the absence of external constraints and highlights the presence of certain conditions
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:30.020]   or opportunities or resources that would enable an individual to pursue their goals or to
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.200]   fulfill their potentials.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.820]   For example, we have free basic education here in Hong Kong for our kids, for our next
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:43.520]   generation that actually enables them to choose what they want to do in the future.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.140]   We try to prepare them as much as possible.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:52.240]   Because of this free education, they have a choice in the future, they have freedom
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.200]   to choose.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:00.880]   And also, since we promote gender equality in workplaces, we want to make sure even females
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.840]   or people from different genders, they have equal opportunity, they have the freedom to
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.380]   choose what they want to do.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.120]   So these are examples of positive freedoms.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.360]   So the bottom line is, for humans to flourish, we need both kinds of freedom.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.920]   We need the positive freedom, we need the negative freedom as well.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.480]   And in his letters to the Galatians, Paul ties this concept of freedom to his core message
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.780]   of the gospel.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.360]   So let's dive back right into this book that we've been reading for the last couple of
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   weeks.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.700]   We're going to start from the beginning of chapter five.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.040]   It says, "It's for freedom that Christ has set us free.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:48.080]   Confirm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery."
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.640]   So in the previous weeks, we have been preaching on this heartfelt message Paul so passionately
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.480]   wanted to communicate to the believers of Galatia.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:04.760]   That the works of the law, the legalistic approach of Judaism, the circumcision whatsoever,
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.720]   these are the yoke of slavery.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.280]   Paul went at length in this letter to cover every angle, to persuade, to tell these Galatians,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.440]   you shouldn't listen to those people who force you to follow the Jewish law as a necessary
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.480]   mean for salvation.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:26.120]   You shouldn't listen to them at all because Christ is enough.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.040]   You don't need anything extra.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.400]   So today, again, sometimes we face that, we face being a Christian, following Christ,
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   it's not enough.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.260]   Maybe I should do something more.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.800]   Maybe I should behave a little bit better for me to have a better standing in front
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   of God.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.480]   And Paul is telling us, Christ is enough, period.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.840]   You don't need anything else.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.640]   You don't need anything extra.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.000]   And Paul is trying to make it crystal clear here.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.680]   It's not that you don't need both Christ and the works of law.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.920]   No, no, it's not even that.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.320]   It's that you actually can't have both.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.680]   It's an either or situation here.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:11.600]   You either try to fulfill the law by your own effort in order to obtain righteousness
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.320]   in God's eyes, which by the way, a lot of people, every single one has tried and they
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   failed.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.720]   Or you obtain righteousness by putting your faith in Jesus alone.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.680]   You either work really, really hard for it, or you get it for free.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.800]   What you cannot do it, now you already have it for free and you try to earn it again by
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.760]   your own effort.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.880]   Paul is saying, if you want to try that way, yeah, be my guest, but Christ will have nothing
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.760]   to do with you.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:49.400]   So imagine for a second with me, if someone is offering you a big house as a gift, in
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.560]   Hong Kong, offering you any size of house is a huge gift already.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.560]   Let it be a big house.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:02.360]   If someone is offering you a huge, big flat or house or whatever as a gift, and you said,
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.920]   wow, thank you, but how much should I pay you?
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:14.120]   I'm like, seriously, if you really want to pay, you're going to pay in the full price.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.620]   That's what Paul's want to say.
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.520]   So he said, every man who lets himself be circumcised, that he's obligated to obey the
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.080]   whole law.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.860]   You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.020]   You have fallen away from grace.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.800]   And I want to be very, very clear with you all here.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:39.480]   Occasionally we may hear this phrase, fallen away from grace.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.600]   And most of the time, the person who says it is trying to describe another person, mostly
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.400]   Christians, committing a sin or a moral failure.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.120]   That's when we say, oh, that person is fallen away from grace.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:58.960]   But that's the exact opposite of what Paul is trying to say here.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.360]   You cannot fall away from grace by sinning.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.760]   Although that's still an issue that we have to tackle, still an issue that we have to
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.640]   deal with.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:15.760]   On a contrary, you fall away from grace by trying to prove you're righteous, or you fall
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.360]   away from grace by trying to earn God's favor with your own merits.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:26.800]   Oh God, I've been serving in this church week in, week out for the last 10 years.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.160]   Why don't you answer my prayers?
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.640]   I've been reading the Bible, I've been going to church, I've been singing, I've been doing
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.120]   all these Christian things.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.120]   Why, why?
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.200]   Or when you start to compare yourself, oh, you know what, I'm a better person, I do this
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.840]   and that and that and that, and the list go on and on.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   When we try to prove that we are righteous, when we try to prove that we're a good person
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:55.160]   by what we do, we fall away from grace.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:02.560]   So the moment we try to prove how much we have paid for something that we receive as
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:08.560]   a free gift, that's the moment we disqualify ourselves to receive it.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.420]   That's what Paul is trying to say.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:16.800]   So you can submit to what Paul described here as a yoke of slavery, an external constraint
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.760]   if you want to try that way.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:27.120]   Then, or if you really want that freedom from Christ, what he's offering you is to set you
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.120]   free.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.280]   It's to take away that yoke of slavery from you, this external constraint from you.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.160]   You are free from the slavery of the law.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.800]   You are free from the misery of ever trying and yet still fall short of God's standard
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.120]   of righteousness.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:50.800]   Paul said it is for this kind of freedom that Christ has set you free.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.920]   Let me be honest with you, I've been a Christian for more than 30 years.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.240]   By the way, I grew up in the church.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.080]   I've been in the church since I was very, very young.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.880]   You can do the math.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.800]   In my 30 plus years of Christian life, I didn't always really understand what freedom in Christ
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   was about.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.800]   When I was young, I thought following Jesus or following God was all about these do's
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   and don'ts.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.000]   If I follow them, if I behave, maybe God will be pleased with me.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.400]   If he's pleased with me, probably my life would be a little bit easier, better, or I
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.720]   would have a little bit more joy down in my heart.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.400]   Like singing a song, I have this joy, joy, joy, joy down here.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.840]   Okay, nobody knows that.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.840]   It's so old.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.840]   Okay, all right.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.280]   I don't know what I want to say.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.800]   But anyway, so I thought if I do all that, all the do's and don'ts written here on this
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   book, maybe God would love me a little bit more and I'll feel a little bit happier.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.440]   I'll be a better Christian.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:54.760]   And that's exactly how I have fallen away from grace.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:02.480]   So that's why when I have fallen away from grace, when I sin, when I failed, when I stumbled,
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.880]   I felt incredibly guilty inside of me and I was so ashamed of myself.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.360]   And that's exactly the curse of the law or the slavery of the law that Paul was trying
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.280]   to describe here.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:22.240]   But Jesus came to set us free from that curse, from that slavery, from that shame, because
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:29.440]   I'm no longer judged according to the law, but I'm accepted according to grace.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.760]   And that's freedom.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:38.520]   If you still remember the two kinds of freedom I mentioned earlier, you would probably notice
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:44.560]   the freedom mentioned by Paul here, the freedom from slavery of the law, it's actually a negative
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.560]   freedom.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:51.760]   Again, this term doesn't mean it's bad or whatever, but let me tell you, as a parent
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:58.660]   of two toddlers, I really have this love-hate relationship with negative freedom.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.840]   You see, every Sunday when I let Mabel walk around here in church or in the playground
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.560]   somewhere, I actually, I'm quite nervous inside.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.240]   So now all of them, they're in Singapore and we were FaceTiming a couple of days ago and
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.120]   Ross just told me, "Oh, Mabel, she fell."
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:20.040]   And when Mabel came into the camera and she saw me, she started pointing at the floor
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.520]   and telling me how she fell and how much it hurt, a one and a half year old trying to
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:31.960]   tell me, and I could see that bump on her lips and I'm like, "Oh, my heart breaks."
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.040]   And again, Singapore last year, when Megan was two and a half years old, we were in the
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.740]   zoo in Singapore.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:42.180]   So halfway through the day, we're at this huge playground.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:48.840]   They have this huge giant slide structure, whatever you call that, and so Megan was playing
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.840]   there.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.840]   And at first I'm like, "Yeah, okay.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.040]   I'm not sure if I should let her run around."
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:59.280]   So I acted as the external constraint or protector, if you will.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.360]   I'm like, "Maybe she's too young to do that."
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.820]   But after maybe 10, 15 minutes, I'm like, "Oh, okay.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.640]   Maybe she can explore that a little bit on her own.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.200]   Maybe I don't have to be overprotective.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.000]   Okay, I'll just let her run."
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.960]   And she gets more excited and she started running.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:21.360]   And just so happened, all of a sudden, she tripped and she fell.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:28.320]   And normally in this kind of playground slide structure, they will be covered by a layer
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.920]   of plasticky kind of materials.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.020]   So when you hit it, it's not too hard, right?
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.240]   But I don't know what they're doing.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.560]   Okay, I shouldn't say anything bad about Singapore.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.660]   I'm going there tomorrow.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.200]   But I don't know what happened to that playground.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.960]   At that giant structure, there are some stairs.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:51.220]   And on the stairs, they actually put a metal plate on every single flight of stair.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.840]   And just so happened, when Megan tripped and fell, her forehead hit the edge of one of
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:03.520]   those metal plates.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.600]   The whole playground went silent when she started crying, just like this.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   And I rushed to her.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.600]   I freaked out.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:16.480]   And when I look at her, there was a bump as big as the size of a golf ball on her forehead
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.280]   here.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:25.640]   So we spent the rest of the day in the emergency room of the children's hospital that day.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.640]   Tell me about it.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   Freedom.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:33.080]   Yeah, I like freedom, maybe.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.640]   But at the same time, it's kind of a scary idea to me.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:42.780]   You see, when we're set free, when we can do whatever we want to do, we're simultaneously
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.440]   exposed to a world of danger.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.920]   And all the Asian parents in the room can say amen with me, right?
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:56.000]   Our freedom can lead us into trouble.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.760]   Best case scenario, it's some minor accidents, no big deal, like Megan's bumping her forehead.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:09.920]   But worse come to worse, we could abuse that freedom and cause serious damage to ourselves
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.880]   and to people around us.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:19.160]   So why on earth would God want us to have freedom if that could mean potential harm
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.160]   to us?
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.360]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.120]   The answer lies in the truth and the full picture of the idea of freedom in Christ.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.240]   Yes, we know freedom in Christ on one hand, it's freedom from law or freedom from the
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.200]   yoke of an impossible task to earn God's favor by our own power and effort.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   Yes.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:46.880]   We live a life free of guilt, free of shame, but all of these guilt and shame, they all
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.720]   come from our sins and our brokenness inside of us.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.440]   And even if we are honest, even when we're Christians, even when we're Christ followers,
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:00.840]   even when we are in church, week in, week out, we are still vulnerable to that kind
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.200]   of temptation, to our sinful desires inside of us.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.240]   We're still challenged by our own sinful nature on a daily basis.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.800]   So this is why Paul describes, he said, he described that as the flesh here.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.940]   And he said, do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:25.840]   If we're driven by our flesh, our selfishness, our sinful desires, then freedom from the
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:31.760]   law would only have a disastrous ending.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:41.520]   So in order to be truly free from sin, we actually need something else or someone else.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.480]   We need more than the absence of external constraints.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:51.360]   We actually need the presence of a power that would overcome the power of sin and darkness
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:57.200]   inside of us so that we could have the ability to choose what is good, to choose what is
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.640]   right, to choose what would bring love and joy and peace, to choose what would build
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.680]   others up instead of tearing others down.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.480]   We need a power to choose.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:15.840]   And that's where the presence of God comes in through his Holy Spirit.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.400]   We need the presence of God through his Spirit inside of us.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   And that's exactly what we get when we start to follow Jesus.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:30.520]   And that's why Paul is saying in another letter, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.200]   freedom.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:41.800]   If freedom from the law is a negative kind of freedom, then the freedom we receive in
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.320]   the power of the Holy Spirit, it's actually a positive freedom.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.520]   He gave us his Holy Spirit to dwell inside of us, to give us the power to overcome our
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:23:00.320]   flesh so that I will or we will finally experience true freedom in our life.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:06.040]   So Paul says, "You, my brothers and sisters, you were called to be free, but do not use
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.480]   your freedom to indulge the flesh.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:14.360]   Rather serve one another humbly in love, for the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:19.480]   one command, love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.360]   And you may be wondering, "Paul, you just said we're free from the law, then why did
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.680]   you bring this up again?"
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.880]   And let me tell you, this is the exciting part.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.880]   This is a great part.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.080]   All right, Paul is going to explain to us what is the positive freedom in the Holy Spirit
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.480]   and what it's all about.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.080]   And in fact, he's going to spend the rest of the entire chapter to explain what walking
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.840]   in the Holy Spirit would look like.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.960]   So church, can I encourage us to just spend a little bit of time this week to just read
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:55.800]   through Galatians 5 and allow God to speak to us directly through his word, just like
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.600]   what Pastor Tim was talking about last week.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.240]   Then come back next week again and allow God to speak to us through the sermon as well.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.240]   Can we do that?
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.400]   All right, all right, two people said they can do that.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.720]   All right, I know you have a busy schedule, I know summer is starting, but yeah, I'm sure
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.280]   you'll be blown away by this message that Paul has written.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:21.120]   Okay, so now I'm going to explain this, but in order to explain it, let me go back to
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.040]   a few verses earlier.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.720]   Let's go back to verse four.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.800]   So just now we read, "You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.920]   from Christ.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.160]   You have fallen away from grace.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.320]   For through the Spirit, we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:45.140]   For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:50.600]   The only thing that counts is faith expressing through love."
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.960]   These two verses are loaded with rich theological content, actually.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.360]   It's one of the few places in the New Testament where you find faith, hope, and love appearing
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.840]   together.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.960]   But if I want to explain this to you, I'm going to need some help from my iPad.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.200]   So I'm going to do this.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   Hold on.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   All right.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   Where are we here?
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   Okay.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   Oops.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:24.000]   Let me connect my iPad to the screen.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Give it a moment.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.080]   Thank you for your patience.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.560]   Now we're on.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.560]   Okay.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.720]   So let me try to explain this.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.000]   So we're humans, right?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.200]   So we have to put a human here.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.200]   We're human.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.360]   Like me, I know.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.120]   We're a human with sinful nature.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.000]   So you see, sin has always been inside of us.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.640]   What does sin actually mean?
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.440]   It means our relationship with God and with one another was kind of like destroyed.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:03.520]   So you see, our relationship with God and with others are destroyed because of sin.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.960]   So we cannot reach God.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   And what is righteousness?
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.920]   Righteousness is one of the very, one of the facet or one of the angle to look at it.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:18.080]   It's when we are in the right relationship with God and with everyone else.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.320]   That's why when the teachers of the law came and asked Jesus, what's the most important
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.680]   thing in the law?
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.240]   Jesus says, you know, the whole law is summarized in these two commands.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.640]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart, might, soul, and you know, whatever, whatever.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.520]   And then the second thing, it's love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.800]   If you can fulfill that, you're basically fulfilling the entire law.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.560]   And that's the old way to look at righteousness.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.040]   And so righteousness, it's here.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.720]   Oh, I should stand here.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.040]   Thank you for reminding me, Ada, just now.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.280]   So righteousness, let me put it up a little bit more.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.800]   Righteousness means we're in a good relationship.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:05.880]   We're in the right relationship with God and others.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:11.400]   Let me draw a very beautiful red heart here to represent that.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.520]   Oh, I like it.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.620]   So in the past, righteousness could only be obtained by the works of the law.
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:27.480]   So God gave us the law and human, what we have to do, you see, what we have to do, we
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.180]   have to put in our works.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:35.360]   So if you have works of the law, you can try to obtain righteousness, but we know everybody
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.840]   tried and they failed.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.680]   So this way, actually, it didn't work for them.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   And then we know, so this way didn't work.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.080]   Nobody actually got saved like that.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.040]   So now we know Jesus, he came.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.600]   So let me use a red cross to represent Jesus.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.640]   This is a cross, if you can imagine.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.160]   This is a cross, this is Jesus.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.160]   He died on the cross for us.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:07.320]   And through Jesus and his cross, by grace, and we can obtain this righteousness.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.520]   So it's by grace through faith, right, that we can obtain righteousness.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.100]   Let me just draw it here.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.600]   So this is how we reach righteousness.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.180]   So everybody following, this is the basics of Christianity.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.760]   If you don't have an idea what I'm talking about, I highly encourage you to join the
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.920]   next baptism class.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.920]   Thank you.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.640]   All right, that's what we explained there.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.440]   All right, so this is the background.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.240]   Oh, by the way, one more thing.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:40.880]   When we accept Jesus, we actually have one more privilege.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.440]   That is, sorry, I'm gonna put the Holy Spirit here.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.440]   That is the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.560]   Okay, Holy Spirit, where are you?
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.360]   Holy Spirit, you are here.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.440]   So we have the Holy Spirit with us here.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.560]   All right, so yes, that's the basic.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:00.120]   We have the Holy Spirit by grace through faith, we have obtained this righteousness.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.880]   Okay, now let's get back to verse five, what Paul is talking about.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:09.960]   Paul is saying here, through the Spirit, by faith, we're waiting for the righteousness
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.000]   that we hope for.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.820]   So Paul gave us a new element here, that there is a hope here.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.160]   And this is what we hope for.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.100]   Let me use another color.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:29.080]   This is what we hope for, by the Holy Spirit and by our faith, we are looking forward to
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.320]   this thing we hope for.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.080]   Righteousness is something we hope for.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.440]   Righteousness is like loving your neighbor as yourself.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.120]   This is something we hope for.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.580]   What does it mean?
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.580]   So let me break it down for you.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:49.240]   First of all, hope in the Christian language is always about something in the future.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.520]   It's something that we don't have it yet.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.840]   We can't see it yet.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.460]   It's something it's not seen already.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.500]   So that's why we have to hope for it.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.300]   We don't see it.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:05.420]   We don't have it right now, but we're kind of so sure that it's there in the future.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.420]   That's why we have hope.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.380]   We have hope that Jesus will come back.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.540]   We have hope that our bodies will raise again and we'll have eternal life.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.380]   That's what we hope for.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.580]   Are you following me so far?
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:25.360]   So Paul is saying through the Holy Spirit, by faith, we have a hope and that hope, it's
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.360]   a righteousness.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.480]   And you are like, Chapman, what are you talking about?
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.520]   I thought we have hope already.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.240]   I thought we have righteousness already.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   Yes.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.960]   The moment you become a Christian, the moment you put your faith in Jesus, you receive,
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.160]   you give Jesus all your sinfulness and you receive his righteousness.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.980]   And in God's eyes, the moment you believe in Jesus, you are a righteous person already.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.980]   That's correct.
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:55.180]   But what Paul is talking about is that one day, that in that final judgment, the day
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:31:01.100]   you see Jesus himself coming back as a King, the day when he's on his throne of judgment,
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:09.880]   he will look at you and he will tell you face to face and say, you are my righteousness.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.000]   And he will tell that to you.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.400]   So whatever other people have been trying so hard to work for, you already have it.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.140]   But one day you will have it for full.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:23.220]   So our righteousness as Christians, just like the kingdom of God that we have always talked
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:27.300]   about is now, but also not yet.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.460]   It's something we already have.
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:34.620]   We are already righteous in God's eyes, but one day we'll hear him say it to us face to
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.620]   face.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.820]   We will have the fullness of that righteousness.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:44.060]   And so the old way, they have to go through the works of law to obtain righteousness.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.980]   They fail, Christ is set us free.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.180]   So this is the negative freedom.
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:55.020]   But now we know that God has given us through the Holy Spirit, also a positive freedom for
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:00.180]   us to overcome the power of sin, for us to love him, for us to love the people around
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.180]   us.
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.380]   So we will reach this righteousness, to love God with all our heart, souls, and mind and
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.380]   strength.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.700]   And we also would love our neighbors as ourself.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:15.320]   We will finally be able to do it through the power of the Holy Spirit in our life.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.380]   But here's the interesting thing.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.660]   The next verse, Paul says, yes, because you're not doing it through the old way.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.700]   So circumcision, uncircumcision, it doesn't matter anyway.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:31.380]   But what matter is a faith that express itself through love.
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:38.140]   Or in some other translations, a faith that is working through love.
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:44.620]   So Paul is tying this back here, back to the idea of love.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.700]   Let me zoom it out so we can all see this.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.300]   Paul is tying it back to the idea of love.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.540]   And you may be wondering, why did Paul say that?
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.980]   And okay, that's the time I have to go back to the slides, say goodbye to this.
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.300]   Anybody needs to take one more picture?
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   Okay, last one, three, two, one, bye.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.300]   Okay.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.300]   Thank you, iPad.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.780]   All right, thank you, Apple.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:12.500]   Let's go back to my notes and let's go back to our slides.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.500]   Where are we?
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:19.100]   We are at faith expressing itself through this idea of love.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.100]   Let me talk about it.
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.540]   I love to talk about this.
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.500]   So here's the interesting part.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.540]   Paul just told us our legalistic work don't matter.
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:31.060]   But what matter is we have a working faith.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:36.340]   So let me highlight the word working for us and unpack it for us.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:42.140]   So yes, I've told you NIV says it's faith expressing itself through love, but more closer
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:46.300]   to the original language translation would be faith working through love.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:51.780]   And the Greek word that Paul used here is the word anagel, which means to work, to be
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.700]   active, to be effective.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.100]   This word may look a little bit familiar to you because that's where the English word
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.420]   energy actually comes from.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:06.300]   So it implies the exertion of power, the manifestation of energy, or the accomplishment of an energy
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.460]   of a task.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:13.540]   The verb often emphasized the dynamic and effective nature of an action or the result
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.200]   it produces.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:23.260]   So Paul is using this word to describe a faith to make a point that genuine faith in Jesus
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:27.740]   Christ is indeed an active faith.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.900]   It's not merely intellectual.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.300]   It's not just some knowledge in our head.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:36.300]   Real faith should produce actions or results.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:43.980]   And not only that, when this faith is active, it works through or it expresses itself through
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.900]   love.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.860]   Because by this faith, just now I draw that picture for you to explain it.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:55.660]   By this faith, we receive righteousness, the fulfillment of law.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.780]   And what is the fulfillment of law?
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.820]   It's love God and love our neighbors.
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:07.220]   And this faith also points us back to the source of love himself.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:12.860]   When we truly believe in a God who loves us so much that he's willing to die on our behalf,
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:19.300]   when we put our trust in such a God, this faith inside of us, it will be active.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.700]   It will be at work.
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.340]   It will produce actions inside of us.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:28.700]   And it produces something or it expresses itself through the same kind of love we have
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.540]   received from God, the agape love.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:36.980]   I know some of you may have heard of this fancy Greek word agape, but do you know that
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:42.500]   actually in Greek there are different words to describe the ideas that we would call love
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.740]   today?
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.140]   For example, there is a word called eros.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.300]   Eros has two characteristics.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.140]   It's a love of the worthy.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:56.620]   So when someone is worthy, I love him or I love her.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.220]   Maybe, you know, I think Chinese people can relate to this.
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:05.620]   If I get like 100 points, 100 marks in my exam, I'm worthy and I receive love.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.620]   That's eros.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.940]   Like when someone is lovable, when someone is worthy, we love them.
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.220]   That's the first characteristics.
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:16.580]   The second one is eros is the love that desires to possess.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:17.820]   You want to own that thing.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:22.900]   You want to own that person if we love him or her or it.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:28.220]   But the word agape speaks of an idea that is completely opposite.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:33.900]   Agape speaks of a love that is given irrespective of merit.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:39.580]   Even when you're unworthy, even when you're not lovable, an agape love will still love
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.580]   you.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.100]   It's a love that you don't need to earn.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:49.080]   And it's not a love that desires to possess, but on the contrary, it's a love that seeks
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.100]   to give.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:57.300]   So we have a God who loves us with a love, not because of who we are, not because we're
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:05.900]   worthy or not, not because of our merits or the lack of, but because He is love Himself.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:12.200]   And because of that love, God the Son came into this world as a man or become a man,
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.460]   and He allowed Himself to be hung on the cross to suffer a horrible and painful death, and
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:22.860]   He sacrificed Himself for us when we were still sinners, when we were still rejecting
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:28.020]   Him, before we tell Him, "Yes, God, I want to follow You," when we were still so broken
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.100]   inside.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.940]   His love, it's not one that desire to possess.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:38.180]   It's a love that seeks to give.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.740]   This is the agape love.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.140]   This is the love of Jesus.
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:53.980]   So today, if we truly believe that He loves you with this agape love, your faith, it would
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.060]   energize inside of you.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:02.180]   It will express this belief through loving those around you with the exact same kind
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.420]   of love that you receive today.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:11.460]   That's why Paul says, "So in your freedom, in your positive freedom that comes from the
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:18.580]   empowerment of the Holy Spirit, you have the power to overcome the sinfulness and selfishness
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:26.820]   in you so that your faith can start to produce actions of agape love in you."
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:33.860]   You, my brothers and sisters, you are called to this kind of freedom.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:39.580]   So do not use this freedom to indulge the flesh.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:46.020]   As your genuine faith in Jesus is expressing itself through this agape self-giving love,
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.420]   serve one another.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:55.180]   And serve one another in Paul's original language, it actually means, literally means, "Be each
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.180]   other's slaves."
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:01.420]   Yes, you are set free, you are no longer slave of the law.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:06.940]   But if this genuine faith in Jesus is at work in you that is expressing itself through this
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:13.820]   agape love, then be each other's slave.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:18.220]   Truth bomb, mind blown.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:26.440]   Just as Jesus has given up himself for us, let's give up ourselves for each other.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.740]   We have a freedom to do it.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:35.260]   We have a freedom to choose even when we're hurt, even when people mistreat us, we still
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:40.020]   have a choice, we can choose, we have the power to choose to love.
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:45.140]   Even that person is not lovable, even they hate us, even they hurt us, we have this power,
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:51.700]   this positive freedom to choose to love when this faith, genuine faith in Jesus is at work
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:40:01.700]   inside of us and it's for this kind of freedom that Christ has set us free.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.820]   So how are we gonna use our freedom today?
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:10.220]   Again, if loving those around you feels more like a do's and don'ts or a requirement from
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:16.380]   your pastor, rather than something you really feel compelled in your heart to do, and I
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:21.380]   wanna invite you to just come to the feet of the cross with me because I need that as
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:27.700]   well, to just experience the agape love Jesus has for you and me.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:33.420]   I don't want you to strive by your own effort and try to, "Okay, I'll force myself to love
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:38.500]   someone," because that's exactly how we fall away from grace.
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:45.140]   Don't strive, just come and receive that agape love of God.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:51.660]   He longs to pour out his love inside of you through his Holy Spirit and he longs to see
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:55.920]   that love start to overflow in our hearts.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:01.180]   And one day when we see him face to face, he will call us righteous.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:05.380]   He'll say, "You have fulfilled righteousness.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.500]   You know how to love your neighbors.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.400]   You know how to love your God.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:15.500]   You are righteous because my Holy Spirit has given you the power, has enabled you.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:20.020]   That faith inside of you has been at work through love.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.360]   You've done it."
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.780]   It's not by us trying so hard, it's by just allowing the Holy Spirit to come and start
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.080]   his work inside of us.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:38.580]   So put your trust in the one who loves you with an unmerited and sacrificial love.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:46.220]   You can't earn his favor, but you also don't need to earn his favor because of Jesus.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.860]   God's favor, it's already on you today.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:51.860]   Let us sink it in.
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.000]   God's favor is on you today.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   He likes you.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.540]   He doesn't just love you, he likes you because of Jesus.
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:03.620]   He's well pleased with you.
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:08.500]   If you ask, if you allow him, he's going to pour out his love through his Holy Spirit
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.060]   in you today.
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:16.460]   And he wants that love to overflow in you until those around you start to feel your
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:23.220]   love and start to feel the same agape love that you received from him.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:27.340]   How are you going to use your freedom today?
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:35.940]   Shall we pray?
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:43.060]   Maybe for some of us here in your entire Christian life, loving someone, loving others, it's
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:48.420]   been more like a command, something you ought to do, you try hard to do, and you know at
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:53.220]   times you fail and you feel very tired and you feel if you're not doing it, you're in
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.220]   trouble.
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:43:03.140]   That's when we fall away from grace and I just want to invite you back into that grace,
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:07.220]   into just coming to receive the love of God today.
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.980]   And just come and receive that.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:14.940]   See how unworthy we are yet God still loves us.
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:20.460]   See how far we have fallen, you know, fallen short of his glory, of his standard of righteousness,
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:27.020]   but he still embraces, loves us anyway.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:36.820]   When you can truly open your heart to receive this kind of love, that's when the transformation
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:37.820]   happens.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:43.940]   And I just had a sense that in this room today, there are some of us here in your entire life,
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:47.720]   you have never known this kind of agape or unconditional love.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:51.780]   In your entire life, people around you, maybe your family, maybe your colleagues, maybe
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:57.480]   your friends, the kind of love you receive from them has always been conditional.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.780]   It's always been kind of like an errorous kind of love.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:03.300]   It's only because you have achieved something, because you are worthy, that's why they love
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:08.980]   you or maybe that's how you're feeling the whole time.
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.860]   And so when you come into the presence of God, you are also automatically thinking,
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:17.000]   if I don't behave, if I don't perform, is God still going to love me?
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.540]   And the answer is yes.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:23.500]   But maybe you have a hard time believing it, maybe you have a hard time aligning with your
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.880]   past experience.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:31.500]   God is saying, if you are willing to believe, to trust that I'm doing it for you, that that
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.740]   is for free, that you don't have to earn my favor, today you're going to experience my
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.860]   love through my Holy Spirit.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.740]   If you're willing to do it today, you don't even have to figure everything out in your
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:47.980]   head, I invite you just to be open and receive.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:55.180]   You can just repeat this prayer after me and say, "Come Holy Spirit, I believe Jesus is
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.080]   enough.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:05.020]   Because of Jesus, because of your death, I can freely receive the fullness of God's love
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:08.980]   today, the agape love.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:13.460]   So come Holy Spirit, pour out the Father's love in me today."
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:37.220]   Just give it a moment, if you're here to receive that.
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:42.540]   Father I pray that today we would truly live in your agape love, we will be filled from
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.740]   head to toe by it.
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:52.620]   And I pray that when we understand what freedom we're called to, when we understand the righteousness
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:46:01.100]   that we are hoping for, Father I pray that today our faith in you would be at work, would
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:07.060]   be active, would energize inside of us, that it would come and change our lives, that the
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.300]   Holy Spirit you will come and transform us.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:14.740]   But I also pray that this faith will be active, our faith will be at work, and we'll be working
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:18.180]   through the agape love.
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:24.180]   I pray that this love would overflow inside of us until every single one around us would
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:28.140]   be blessed by it.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.580]   So if you're willing, if that's your prayer as well, I invite you to stand with me today
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:37.500]   as we worship, as we sing.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:45.140]   I pray, I pray for a deeper revelation of God's love for us.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.300]   How long, how wide, how deep.
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:54.840]   I pray it will be a revelation by the Holy Spirit that you know how much He loves you,
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.940]   so that you can start walking in that kind of love and your faith will be working through
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.940]   this kind of love today.
