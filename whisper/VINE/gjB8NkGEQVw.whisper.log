[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900]   Well, good morning, everybody.
[00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.180]   My name is Pastor Promise.
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.880]   Every time I say the words, "Pastor Promise,"
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.900]   it feels weird.
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.780]   Call her, I'm Dada, to my daughter.
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.620]   My daughter is here.
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.660]   She's never here at the 11 o'clock,
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.620]   so this is gonna be nice and challenging.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.860]   Well, hey, I'm glad that you guys are here.
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.760]   You chose to be here this morning.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.720]   So the sermon writing process is an interesting one.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.280]   We pray, we ask God, we write down the words,
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.760]   and we pass it on to someone to look at it and to edit it
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.520]   and to make sure that we are going in the right direction.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.000]   And we've prayed over today's sermon,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.560]   and we're gonna preach that.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.500]   Don't worry, Andrew, I'm not gonna go off script.
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.040]   But I wanna plead with you guys.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.680]   I kinda wanna put out what my intention
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.480]   with this whole sermon is.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.640]   And beyond my intention, what I believe God's intention
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.400]   with today's sermon is.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.400]   You guys wanna know what God desires you to get out of this?
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.520]   Anyone here?
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.100]   Yeah?
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.100]   I plead with you that in listening to the words today,
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.520]   that you would consider in your heart
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.040]   what it means to follow Jesus.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.600]   I plead with you today that you would consider in your heart
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.640]   what are the things of God,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.100]   and do those things create excitement in me?
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.880]   Are those things that I'm aligned with,
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.200]   that I desire to see in the world fulfilled through him?
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.220]   I plead with you today that you would ask yourself,
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.900]   how do I truly follow who Jesus is?
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.760]   That is my hope.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.340]   That is all I wanna get out of today's sermon.
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.700]   And I really want you guys to sit in this place of wrestling.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.260]   What does it mean to follow Jesus,
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260]   and how do I make sure I follow him?
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.120]   'Cause that's what it's all about, right?
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.520]   We gather, we worship, we sing,
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.160]   but we've got to become people who follow Jesus.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.880]   That's from the bottom of my heart.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.320]   That's where I hope we land today.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.020]   So we're continuing this series of Uncharted.
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.100]   And as we were studying, looking through it,
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.780]   I did a little bit of research,
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.660]   a little bit of homework to look and see
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.660]   that our New Testament has 27 books inside.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.140]   A lot of books.
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.340]   27 books inside the New Testament.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.620]   Of those 27 books,
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.060]   half of them are written by the same guy, right?
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.140]   Does anyone know who that is?
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.540]   Just to see if...
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.540]   Anyone?
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.460]   Say it with your chest, anyone?
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.300]   Paul, there we go.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.300]   Yes, well done.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.740]   Paul has written more than half of the books
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.460]   in the New Testament.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.280]   This is incredible.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.540]   He's written all these letters that we call epistles.
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.820]   These books, which purposes are to reveal Jesus, yes,
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.140]   but to help edify, help grow,
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.140]   help replenish the churches all across the Roman Empire.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.660]   These letters are written to churches
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.120]   that he's either started or established or planted himself.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.700]   Here at the Vine, 2000 plus years later,
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.540]   we are benefic, benefic, beneficians?
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.380]   There we go.
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.140]   Beneficiaries, benefactors, all the benefits.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.780]   We benefit, there's a word for you.
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.820]   We benefit from what Paul wrote.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.460]   In Ephesians, his letter to the church in Ephesus,
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.060]   he writes this prayer.
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.660]   He goes, "I pray that we would grasp how wide and long
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.260]   "and how high and how deep is the love of Christ
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.820]   "and to know this love which passes knowledge,
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.960]   "that we would be filled to the measure
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.040]   "of all the fullness of God."
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.320]   Filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.400]   That's where we get our very purpose here at the Vine
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.480]   in growing big people, that we would grow in understanding
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.880]   and all the measure of the fullness of God.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.360]   Paul is an incredible figure.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.080]   His role within that first century church
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.560]   is to bring together these two communities,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.060]   Gentiles who were people who were not heirs
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.040]   of the promise of God.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.200]   They were outside of that promise.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.300]   They were ethnically a different group of people.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.840]   So all the promises of the Old Testament,
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.100]   all the good news, didn't apply to them.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.000]   But through Paul, the Holy Spirit would bring these people
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.760]   and the Jewish believers, these new Christians
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.320]   together in one community.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.160]   Paul would be something like a unifying factor
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.400]   to help bring together a unified community.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.800]   If you've been in church for any time,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.120]   you would know that Paul's letters are super popular.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.800]   Some of the words he uses are pretty awesome, right?
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.760]   A little bit of Bible bingo for you.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.840]   Paul wrote, let's see, "The Armor of God."
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.680]   You guys know that one?
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.520]   "The Armor of God."
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.360]   "The fruits of the Spirit."
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.960]   "Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness."
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.720]   If you've been to any wedding ever,
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.760]   you've probably heard one of his famous ones.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.280]   The first Corinthians, "Love is patient, love is kind."
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.320]   Everyone really loves that one
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.320]   when they have someone that they love
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.360]   and they wanna say it to.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.720]   Or perhaps maybe his most tattooable.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.000]   Yeah, Paul wrote some things that people have probably,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.240]   there might be someone in this room with a tattoo of this.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.480]   And I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.440]   Right?
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.120]   Some incredible statements are given to us
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.520]   through the life of Paul.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.460]   But I don't wanna just paint Paul out to be someone
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.400]   who said and wrote a lot of good things.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.640]   Paul with his life lived incredibly.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.120]   He went on three massive missionary journeys
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.840]   as a way to take the good news of the gospel
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.160]   throughout the Roman Empire,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.960]   going out to city after city,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.240]   planting and helping build and helping strengthen churches.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.520]   He gets shipwrecked, he gets bitten by snakes,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.480]   he gets threatened, he gets stoned.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.880]   All these things that happened to him,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.580]   persecuted, eventually ends up dying.
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.800]   He gives his life to make sure
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.100]   that the world knows who Jesus is.
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.520]   He would say that compared to the pain he would feel,
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.120]   that the joy of knowing Christ is even greater.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   He would say, "I count everything as lost just to know him."
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.440]   Paul is what you would call a hero of our faith.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.240]   Said a lot of good things, wrote a lot of good things,
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.080]   did a lot of good things.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.440]   He really helped establish Christianity as we know it today.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.680]   But this hero of our faith was not always a hero
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.160]   of our faith.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.800]   You could say this, Paul had a past.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.040]   Paul did some pretty dodgy things
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.440]   before he became a Christian.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.560]   So someone who's known for being one
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.000]   who is building up the church
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.360]   and helping strengthen their church,
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.700]   before he was a Christian, was the exact opposite of this.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.760]   His name wasn't Paul, his name was Saul back then.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.760]   And he lived to eradicate this Jesus following movement
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.400]   that existed in Jerusalem and throughout the region.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.120]   His goal was to make sure
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.800]   that this Jesus movement stopped.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.880]   His early career, he persecuted and jailed and beat
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.800]   and even had people killed who believed this Jesus person
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.400]   and aligned themselves with him.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.640]   So how ironic that the thing he's most famous for
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.240]   was the thing that he hated so much
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.320]   before his transformation.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.100]   But he does have a transformation.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.140]   There is a change from a Saul to a Paul.
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.820]   And if you've been in church any time,
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.800]   this will be somewhat of a popular story
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.480]   or familiar story where he is,
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.520]   the apostles would say he is breathing murderous threats
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.920]   against those who believe in Jesus.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.120]   And he's given permission by the chief priests
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.720]   to go outside of Jerusalem and into Damascus
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.080]   to round up the Christians there
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.240]   and bring them back to Jerusalem for persecution.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.400]   So he's on his way.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.840]   He, with the people that he needs,
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.160]   with the authority that he has,
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.440]   on his way to go and persecute more Christians.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.720]   When all of a sudden a light from heaven shines down on him,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   he falls off of his horse and he sees Jesus,
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.640]   Jesus standing before him.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.360]   Jesus asked him this question.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.320]   He goes, Saul, why are you persecuting me?
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.200]   And in that moment, Saul has an encounter
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.880]   that changes his life.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.640]   He experiences Jesus and leaves that experience blind,
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.480]   cannot see.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.040]   Maybe the most powerful person all of a sudden now,
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.040]   maybe one of the most vulnerable people.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.880]   His transformation is not complete though.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.360]   See, God started something in that road to Damascus
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.920]   that would be completed through the Holy Spirit
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.440]   working with another person.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.320]   Someone else was going to have to pay a pretty big cost.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.120]   Someone else would have to intervene
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.120]   and help establish Paul into who he would be.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:35.240]   This is where we get the story of Ananias.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.200]   So today our teaching text is gonna be found
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.800]   in Acts chapter nine, starting at verse 10.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.000]   So I'm gonna open my Bible.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.960]   If you have one of these old relics,
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.800]   Bibles, physical ones, you can open it with me as well.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.120]   Looking here in Acts chapter nine, starting at verse 10.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.240]   If you don't have a Bible,
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.480]   it will be provided for you on the screen.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.320]   I'm gonna read this out.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.440]   It says, in Damascus, there was a disciple named Ananias.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.600]   The Lord called to him in a vision, Ananias.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.240]   Yes, Lord, he answered.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.640]   Lord told him, go to the house of Judas on Straight Street
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.640]   and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul,
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.720]   for he is praying.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.440]   So in a vision, he has seen a man named Ananias come
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.280]   and place his hands on him to restore his sight.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.100]   Lord, Ananias answered, I have heard many reports
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.620]   about this man and all the harm he has done
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.520]   to your holy people in Jerusalem.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.920]   And he has come here with the authority
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.400]   from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.720]   But the Lord said to Ananias, go.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.240]   This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.160]   to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.520]   I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.080]   Then Ananias went to the house and entered it,
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.840]   placing his hands on Saul.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.160]   He said, brother Saul, the Lord Jesus,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.320]   who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here,
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.440]   he has sent me so that you may see again
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.320]   and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.120]   And immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.160]   and he could see again.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160]   He got up and was baptized.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.920]   And after taking some food, he regained his strength.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.360]   Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.080]   At once, he began preaching in the synagogues
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.880]   that Jesus is the son of God.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.920]   All those who heard him were astonished.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.440]   And they asked, isn't he the man
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.560]   who raised havoc in Jerusalem
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.080]   among those who call on this name?
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.320]   And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.600]   to the chief priests?
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.560]   Yet Saul grew more and more powerful
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.280]   and baffled the Jews living in Damascus
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.360]   by proving that Jesus was the Messiah.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.240]   Let me pray for us.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.420]   Jesus, we come before you this morning.
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.520]   We open your word and we ask Holy Spirit,
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.880]   not for interesting thoughts and good comprehension, God,
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.480]   but that your living, breathing word would do what it does.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.240]   It would penetrate into our hearts,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.940]   that it would begin to transform us
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.720]   as we see you through this story.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.640]   Would you open our ears?
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.560]   Would you make our hearts fertile soil
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.440]   for the things that you have for us this morning?
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.300]   We pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.000]   So basically Ananias is this person
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.360]   who's gonna be used in the transformation of Saul.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.840]   This is a guy who we know very little about.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.600]   Raise your hand if you know anything about Ananias.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.040]   Hey, besides Pastor Andrew.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.840]   Not really, like we don't know who that is.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.120]   Saul, Paul we know, John, Peter, those are big names.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.760]   Ananias, never heard of the guy, right?
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.000]   No one really knows him.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.720]   But this is about to be his moment.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.960]   While living under persecution in the first century,
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.460]   we're gonna see that God calls out to Ananias
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.080]   to go into the known.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.080]   Now I wrestled with whether or not to say it like this.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.320]   Into the known should make you be like, wait,
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.000]   our whole series that we're on is about the unknown, right?
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.920]   The uncharted, right?
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.160]   Like that's what we're talking about.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.560]   How does God calling Ananias to go into the known?
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.080]   Well, in this case, yes, the whole journey as a whole
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.520]   and how it's gonna play out is unknown,
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.920]   but there are things that he does know.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.280]   He's aware of the cost that this is gonna be for him.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.800]   He's aware of who Saul is, right?
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.440]   So he's aware that he's about to step into a very dangerous,
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.560]   tricky, challenging, and hard situation.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.320]   And it probably makes him uncomfortable a little bit.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:37.320]   What he would know is that this would require some risk.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.040]   And Ananias is gonna have to ask himself,
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.080]   where does he truly stand?
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.960]   A call to the uncharted where Ananias
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.520]   is going to have to weigh his options.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.640]   He's gonna have to consider his beliefs
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.440]   and where his trust truly is.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.240]   Where Ananias is gonna have to ask himself,
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.480]   do I believe enough to follow?
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.120]   I believe, but do I believe enough to follow?
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.200]   Or does my belief in Jesus boil down
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.880]   to a collection of interesting information
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.800]   that I've gathered?
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.520]   He has to ask himself if he believes enough to be obedient
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.280]   to the call that is put on him.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.960]   This is all part of the uncharted journey
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.040]   that you and I are also on.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.880]   We are going to be stepping into seasons
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.800]   if we've not already, where God's gonna be calling us
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.520]   to do some pretty risky, dangerous,
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.960]   maybe seemingly crazy things.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.040]   And we're gonna be faced with that question.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.600]   Do I believe enough to trust him and to follow him?
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.600]   Do I believe enough to step into this known challenge?
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.800]   Do I believe enough to follow him
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.200]   into the uncharted territories and uncharted spaces?
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.120]   Knowing this would be challenging,
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.320]   knowing this is gonna cost us.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.520]   See, Pastor Andrew last week said something
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.680]   that I thought was really, really, really good.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.160]   She does say quite a few things regularly,
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.000]   they're pretty good.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.760]   But this time, it was this one that I was like,
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.960]   whew, gonna say it again.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.800]   So I'm gonna put it back up here.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.680]   He's talking about the idea of persecution.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.000]   And I want you to remind us of this.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.840]   He said this, "When putting Christ first
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.600]   "comes with great personal cost,
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.360]   "we are tempted to choose what is safe
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.280]   "rather than obedience to him."
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.960]   (child yelling)
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.400]   My daughter said, "Amen, that's awesome."
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.920]   Thanks, honey.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.600]   This is the very position that Ananias is in.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.080]   God is extending an invitation to something
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.160]   that seems crazy, something that's never been done before.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.480]   For him to go against the grain,
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.080]   something that's gonna require him
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.920]   to have new levels of dependency on God.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.240]   See, the rumors of who saw what,
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.520]   was well known, everyone knew who Saul would be.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.400]   Saul's killings and his persecution,
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.960]   he was efficient at what he did
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.280]   when it came to persecuting Christians.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.160]   And this would be the backdrop
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.200]   in which God would invite Ananias
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.560]   into following him into the uncharted.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.200]   I love the way that Luke tells this story
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.560]   because he tells it in a very interesting way.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.040]   The way he writes it,
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.640]   he's telling it in a very interesting way.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.200]   He writes it, highlights certain things to the reader
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.000]   that we need to understand
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.400]   when it comes to stepping into situations just like this.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   With Ananias, Luke actually doesn't give us
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.960]   many details about him.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.240]   It's actually quite a short little bit he tells us.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.920]   What Luke chooses to disclose about Ananias
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.600]   is perhaps the only small detail.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.320]   But it's not about his family, it's not about his status,
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.800]   it's not about his church attendance,
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.120]   it's not about what he served in
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.600]   and what team he served with.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.560]   It's not about any of that stuff.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.640]   It's not about how much money he had, who he was.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.120]   None of that stuff seemed to matter.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.760]   What Luke ends up telling us about Ananias
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.680]   is something about his identity.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.080]   And perhaps the most important thing about Ananias
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.920]   is boiled down to this.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.880]   This little identity concept
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.680]   would be the way Ananias would shape
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.360]   how he made his decisions.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.080]   It would be what would make him ultimately Ananias.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.000]   It'd be how he would weigh his options
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.080]   in difficult situations.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.760]   What Luke gives us is this.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.360]   He says, "In Damascus, there was a disciple named Ananias."
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.920]   So what's Ananias' big descriptor?
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.520]   What's the big detail about Ananias?
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.520]   He's a disciple.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.000]   That's it.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.840]   Nothing else.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.680]   He is a disciple.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.960]   So Luke deems the only detail worth noting,
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.280]   or better yet, the one detail that tells you
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.440]   everything you need to know about who Ananias is
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.960]   is that he is a disciple of Jesus.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.360]   He believes and he follows in Jesus.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.740]   This word disciple is a common word in our New Testament.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.560]   Across the first five books of the New Testament,
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.280]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Acts,
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.280]   the word disciple appears 261 times.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.160]   This is a common word.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.760]   And it simply means this, one who follows.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.600]   Right?
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.160]   So we can, a disciple is someone who follows.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.960]   When we hear disciples at the very beginning
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.580]   of the gospels in Matthew,
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.920]   what is it that they're called to do?
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.960]   Come and follow me, is what Jesus tells them.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.560]   It's the very nature of a disciple to live
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.640]   and respond into adherence of the person
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.920]   that they're following.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.740]   Right?
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.600]   They go with that person where that person goes.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.320]   So then a disciple of Jesus, as Ananias would be,
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.920]   would be one who would follow Jesus in his belief patterns,
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.360]   follow Jesus in his ideological leanings,
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.100]   follow Jesus in his behavior, in his practice.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.880]   The follower of Jesus would be one who follows Jesus
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.400]   in his prioritization, in his preferences,
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.920]   in his decision-making process,
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.160]   in his posture towards society and culture.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.280]   This is what it means to be a disciple,
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.800]   a specifically disciple of Jesus.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.100]   So as a disciple of Jesus, Ananias lives a certain way,
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.620]   responding to the belief that he has in Jesus.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.460]   Right?
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.420]   He has decided that Christ is enough.
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.480]   We sang it earlier, right?
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.720]   Christ is enough for me.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.300]   Like he liked that song too.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.720]   Everything in his life was going to exist
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.360]   to respond to who Jesus was.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.600]   So when God calls him into this ridiculously challenging,
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.760]   hard, really clearly difficult situation
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.060]   of going to Saul, who is a murderous persecutor,
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:22.580]   the posture of his discipleship
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.480]   is what's gonna make it possible for him to follow
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.000]   into the known dangers, into the uncharted areas.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.440]   Because Luke identifies Ananias as a disciple,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.960]   it should give us the readers a bit of a foreshadowing
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.460]   as to what's gonna happen, right?
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.220]   Because he's a disciple, we should therefore know
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.360]   what his decision is gonna be.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.580]   His decision is gonna be, yes, I'm gonna follow
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:46.960]   because disciples follow.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.720]   It's like playing, I remember the first time I heard
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.060]   the idea of what a disciple was,
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.240]   someone did like a cool little like skit for me.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.880]   They played, has anyone played the game Follow the Leader?
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.720]   Did I make it?
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.540]   Yeah, yeah, Follow the Leader.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.520]   So one person starts walking and then you just follow them.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.560]   That's literally what a disciple does.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.120]   They follow that person.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.160]   So for Ananias, whatever he's about to be asked,
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.320]   no matter how much we know about him,
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.760]   because we know he's a disciple,
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.240]   we can be certain that he is going to follow Jesus.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.200]   But Ananias does have a choice
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.600]   because Jesus isn't the only thing that can be followed.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.640]   There's quite a few things we can follow.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.340]   For many of us in this season of uncharted,
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.740]   whether we face it now or we're gonna be facing it,
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.200]   we're gonna be faced with the choice
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.880]   of what are we actually going to follow?
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.920]   And I know it could seem easy.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.320]   Well, if you're Christian, we follow Jesus, right?
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.680]   Sometimes it's not that easy.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.440]   In moments when it's challenging,
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.880]   we can find ourselves if we're not careful,
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.800]   actually following the circumstance and not Jesus.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.480]   As in we are tempted to follow Jesus
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.160]   only when the situation ahead,
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.440]   the circumstance ahead seems right,
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.680]   according to our observation,
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.560]   seems favorable according to our observations.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.360]   When verses like Psalm chapter 23,
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.360]   where he leads us by still water,
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.920]   where he leads us into green pastures,
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.920]   when Jesus does that, I mean, sign me up,
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.680]   I'm ready to follow, right?
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.100]   That sounds like a good chance of following the leader.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.440]   I would love some green pastures
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.020]   and some still calm waters.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.660]   But in the same book, in the same chapter,
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.760]   that following Jesus also continues
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.080]   into the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.080]   where our enemies are around us.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.880]   For Ananias, it would be following Jesus
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.920]   would be following him into a conversation,
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.920]   into an encounter with Saul,
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.700]   the very person who has the authority
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.340]   to take him in as a Jesus follower.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:45.080]   When we find ourselves at this crossroads,
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.920]   will we follow what we observe?
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.640]   Will we follow how favorable the situation
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.080]   or circumstance is,
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.800]   or are we at risk of not following Jesus at all?
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920]   And please don't get me wrong,
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.520]   I'm not saying that Jesus is saying,
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.040]   don't consider how challenging it is.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.480]   I'm not saying that Jesus is saying,
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.680]   pretend like every challenging invitation is easy.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.880]   Jesus has no desire for you to lie about how hard
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.120]   what he's calling you is.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.440]   He's not called you to not feel or not observe
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.480]   or not have senses about what's going on.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.460]   We are going to feel, he's given us senses for a reason.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.520]   It's okay to acknowledge the feelings,
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.120]   but he's saying that you can't always follow
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.260]   the observations, you can't always follow
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.060]   your assessment of the road ahead.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.860]   You can't always follow how you feel.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.360]   At some point, the way of our feelings
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.320]   and the way of Jesus will clash.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.120]   They will become opposites.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.460]   And there are times where our feelings
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.380]   are simply meant to be felt and not followed.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.540]   When things appear one way,
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.660]   know that God isn't calling us to follow an appearance
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.140]   because uncharted is an invitation
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.720]   to lean not on your own understandings,
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.000]   but to lean on him.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.020]   The heavy reality for us is that we are at risk
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.820]   of actually not following Jesus,
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.620]   but instead following circumstances.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.420]   That's just the truth.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.520]   That's the temptation we have to wrestle with regularly.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.760]   For many of us, I know our desire is to follow Jesus.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.740]   We're here because we want to follow Jesus.
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.100]   So I just wanna make it really clear
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.780]   what the disguise things are,
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:26.320]   what the alternative paths are that present themselves
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.900]   as if we are following Jesus.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.620]   It can be such a subtle temptation to follow a circumstance
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.180]   when it's good thinking that we're following Jesus.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.540]   It requires a nuance and understanding.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.580]   And I love that we have a good example
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.140]   of how Ananias felt tempted to do the exact same thing
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.580]   in verse 13, it reads this.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.880]   He goes, "Lord," answered Ananias,
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.760]   "I have heard many reports about this man."
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.680]   I have observed, I have heard, I have seen.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.800]   He is dangerous, right?
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.400]   And all the harm he has done to your holy people.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.960]   He's come here with authority, God,
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.880]   from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.000]   Ananias has a legit reason to have fear.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.640]   Ananias has a legit reason because Saul is notorious
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.360]   at this point for his killings and his arrests,
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.440]   ruthlessly persecuting Christians.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.840]   Saul is efficient.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.840]   Everything Ananias is saying in this response to God
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.260]   is true, consider that.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.480]   His fear is not wrong, it's true.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:32.920]   Yet there's a difference in acknowledging the cost
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:38.340]   and being a disciple of a favorable circumstance.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.200]   It's one thing in recognizing
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.240]   that this is gonna cost me much.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.880]   It's another thing in allowing it to stop you
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.120]   from following Jesus into it anyways.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.200]   This is what Ananias would have to wrestle with.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.900]   Listen, uncharted, this season that we're going into,
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.400]   that we're in now,
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.500]   is not an invitation to favorable circumstances.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.420]   I think we just need to get that clear.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.480]   It's not an invitation to everything just going super well
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.520]   and super easy and not having any challenges.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.080]   It's an invitation to follow the sovereign Jesus
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.180]   who has victory over both the favorable
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.600]   and the unfavorable circumstances, right?
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.440]   That's our Jesus.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.240]   He has victory over all of that.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.960]   And because Ananias is a disciple of Jesus,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.000]   because he follows Christ alone,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.920]   he's willing to walk into the known danger ahead of him.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.120]   And when we follow Jesus alone,
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.360]   we too can be willing to walk.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.060]   Yes, having some fear, but having a greater confidence
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.520]   because our eyes, our sight is fixed
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.840]   on the one that we follow, right?
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.840]   Fixed on the victorious Jesus
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.640]   who has overcome all things,
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.620]   even the conditions of the journey ahead.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.640]   See, the decisions we are willing to make
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.000]   will show us what it is we truly follow.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.600]   The decisions we are willing to make
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.320]   will show us what it is that we truly follow.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:06.320]   I find Ananias reminding God of Paul's,
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.160]   Saul's CV very interesting.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.280]   He tells him, "Lord, there's many, many, many reports
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.120]   about this."
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.480]   Like you couldn't have missed this, right?
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.760]   This guy is a bad guy, straight out.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.920]   There's nothing good about him.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.120]   Did you get me the wrong person that you want me to go to?
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.220]   Because me being a Christian,
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.760]   someone that follows you stepping into a situation
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.600]   with this guy could be the end of me.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.880]   God, are you sure this is who you want me to go to
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.920]   and help him?
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.360]   Right, that's a good question.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.600]   That's a fair question.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.240]   It's in moments like this that we realize
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.840]   that there is sacrifice involved in following Jesus.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.560]   Disciples of Jesus will have to sacrifice
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.280]   at some point in our lives.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.720]   But how does exactly does God get you from this space
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.040]   where you acknowledge your feelings
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.120]   and you acknowledge the difficulty ahead
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.160]   into actually then going and doing what it is?
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.280]   How does he get you from recognizing
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.880]   that it's gonna cost you a lot
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:06.080]   to faithfully living in obedience despite the cost?
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.120]   Well, let's look and see what he says to Ananias.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.200]   He says this, "Go!"
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.040]   This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.440]   to the Gentiles and to their kings
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.640]   and to the people of Israel.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.800]   Can we appreciate the fact
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.000]   that God kind of ignores his questions?
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.960]   Like homeboy is like, I'm terrified, God,
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.920]   he's gonna kill me.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.160]   He has all the authority
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.240]   and I'm gonna be the victim number one.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.800]   You want me to go to the person who's after me?
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.200]   And God is like, but he's my chosen instrument.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.560]   Like, what is that?
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.040]   Right, like, I mean, you would expect that God would just,
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.340]   for me, you know what would work?
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.000]   If I pray and I'm like, God, you know, this is challenging.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.640]   If you would just give me some assurance,
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.400]   I feel like I'd be more confident to go
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.160]   and live out what God has called me to live, right?
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.600]   If he just said, all right, promise,
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.680]   go into this dangerous situation,
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.780]   go into a situation that's gonna cost you a lot.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.540]   But he also said, it's okay,
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.840]   I'll make sure your bank account's still full.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.360]   It's okay, I'll make sure no harm comes
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.720]   to you and your family.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   It's okay, nothing about what you,
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.520]   the way you expect your life to go,
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.160]   it'll still go exactly like that.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.240]   Then I'd be like, yeah, let's go
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.520]   into the known and the unknown.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.600]   I don't really care, I would go with him, right?
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.280]   And I feel like most of us would do the same thing
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.080]   if God would just give us the assurance
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.240]   that it's gonna be okay.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.080]   Just follow me, it's gonna be okay.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.400]   Nothing bad's gonna happen.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.560]   You don't have to worry about anything.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.040]   It's all just gonna be good, good, good.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.360]   There's no cost involved.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:27.000]   If he just gave us this assurance, for so many of us,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.480]   that's what it would take for us to follow.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.320]   But he doesn't do this with Ananias.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.560]   He does not assure him at all.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.720]   He doesn't tell him that it's gonna be okay,
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.880]   that there's no chance for failure,
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.260]   that nothing bad will happen,
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.560]   that life will carry on like he expected it.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.560]   - Yeah.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:46.720]   - Now, see, God sees Ananias' desire for assurance,
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.280]   and instead he chooses to answer him by saying this.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.680]   This man Saul is my chosen instrument
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.440]   to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.320]   and to the people of Israel.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.260]   Look at this.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.120]   God takes a man looking for assurance
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.920]   and instead shows him purpose.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.720]   Sit on that for a minute.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.600]   God takes us when we're looking for this assurance
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.800]   that we're gonna be okay,
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.520]   that nothing dangerous or hard is gonna come to us.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.360]   And instead of addressing that, he shows purpose.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:21.500]   He's saying, Ananias, consider the things I have planned.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.200]   You see Saul one way, but actually I see him differently.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.080]   You see him as this great persecutor,
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.280]   but I being God who knows all things,
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.800]   where all things are possible, the way making God,
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.020]   I see him as the very person who takes the good news
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.520]   to all of the Gentiles, who extends the kingdom of heaven
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.840]   and brings them in all under this banner of Jesus
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.800]   as the church.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.280]   I see him differently.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.280]   He is my chosen instrument.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.080]   The thing you fear is the very thing I'm gonna be using
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.560]   to extend the gospel.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:58.500]   See, cost is often associated with value.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.520]   God doesn't call us to sacrifice simply because,
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.980]   sounds fun, let's just test them and see how they do.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.560]   He didn't call us to sacrifice just because it's a religion.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.480]   No, the cost indicates that there is value
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.260]   on the other side.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.360]   God shows Ananias the value by showing him the purpose.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.620]   And it makes me wonder, I didn't make this a slide,
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.080]   so I want us to listen.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.220]   It makes me wonder this, how many of our fears
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.040]   and our hesitations to respond to Jesus
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.800]   with a costly sacrifice need to be seen
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.320]   from a place of purpose rather than from a place
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.260]   of assurance?
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.000]   I'll say that again, 'cause it's not up here.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.200]   How many of our fears and our hesitations to respond
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.280]   to Jesus with costly sacrifice need to be seen
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.220]   from a place of purpose rather than assurance?
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.520]   Would we even still, while feeling the feels,
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.360]   be more willing to step into uncharted territories,
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.520]   knowing that God isn't randomly leading us there,
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.060]   but he has valuable purpose planned?
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.360]   There is a cost because there is value.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.360]   God's not wasteful.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.520]   So it's only natural that we ask, what's the purpose?
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.100]   And in Ananias' case, God gives him a very clear,
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.840]   exact, distinct purpose behind why he calls him.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.080]   So what's the purpose, God?
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.560]   The reality is that God's not always gonna give you
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.040]   the exact purpose.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.320]   Can we just be real?
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.920]   He's not always gonna tell you exactly why you need
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.760]   to go through this hard thing.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.720]   He's not always gonna show you the big picture
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.320]   and exactly how it's gonna play out.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.680]   But for the Christian, for the follower of Jesus,
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.640]   for those of us that know him, the call is enough,
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.520]   'cause if we know him, we know his purposes.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.520]   And what are his purposes?
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.520]   To bring the fullness of the kingdom of God here,
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.260]   where there's brokenness to fix it,
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.840]   where there's darkness to bring light,
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.400]   where there's despair to bring hope,
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.880]   where there's lies to bring truth,
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.960]   where there's insecurity to bring confidence,
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.440]   where there's absolute rubbish in the world
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.480]   to bring hope and to rebuild.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.800]   So those are the purposes of God.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.360]   Those are the things he's doing.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.720]   Those are the ways he's moving.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.520]   That's what his kingdom on earth looks like,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.840]   setting the captives free,
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.360]   elevating the truth of the goodness of God,
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.880]   liberating us from sin and the hole that it has
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.000]   through the blood of Jesus.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.280]   And if we forget these purposes,
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.840]   it becomes near impossible to willingly sacrifice.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.520]   Again, I'm gonna quote Andrew.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.640]   Last week, he said this about persecution.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.040]   One of the things that we can do is deepen our roots.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.080]   I 100% agree with it.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.760]   I'm gonna add a little bit more to it.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.200]   One of the things we can do is deepen our roots
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.240]   by becoming familiar with God again.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.080]   Absolutely.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.880]   That is what we need to do, persecution,
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.360]   and with costly sacrifice.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:50.360]   But can I add that we need to also become more familiar
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.960]   with the purposes of God again?
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.040]   Because the slide is this.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.440]   We won't be willing to suffer for what we don't know,
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.640]   for what we don't love.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:06.800]   When we consider these purposes,
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.760]   the reconciliation and the restoration of all of humanity
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.120]   and all of creation,
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.320]   when we consider what God is doing,
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.720]   we remember that the waters are uncharted,
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.920]   the spaces ahead are uncharted,
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.320]   but our God's an open book.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.360]   He's not uncharted.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.760]   He's not the one in question.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.440]   He's known, he's revealed,
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.320]   he's made clear who he is and his heart and his purposes.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.360]   And so when we know that,
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.360]   there becomes no real fear
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.840]   when we sit in uncharted territories.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.080]   Even in known dangers,
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.600]   there's no risk that's too big
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.760]   if we remember the purposes behind what God is doing
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.360]   in and through us,
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.440]   that he is good,
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.960]   therefore no price is too steep,
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.160]   that he is good,
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.960]   that his ways are good,
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.040]   that his purposes for all creation is good.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.760]   My heart for all of us here in this room and online
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.440]   is that we would consider the worthiness of God
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.720]   when we remember his purposes
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.440]   and that his purposes would be enough
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.920]   to call us to consider
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:14.920]   and to respond to the costly sacrifice of trusting in him.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.000]   That we too can be aligned and so in love
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   and so desire to see the fullness of God's kingdom here
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.680]   where suffering ends,
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.720]   where shame ends,
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.240]   where brokenness ends,
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.080]   like that is the kingdom
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.840]   where full restoration takes place.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.960]   That is what our hearts should long for as his people
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.640]   when we remember his purposes.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.720]   And when we remember this,
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.520]   we become so in love with it,
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.840]   we insist on paying for it because it is valuable.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.480]   It is of great value.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.920]   It is probably the most valuable thing
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.240]   this world's gonna see, right?
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.840]   We insist on paying for it.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.200]   We will be a people who say,
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:05.080]   we will not sacrifice to the Lord our God,
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.240]   a life that costs us nothing.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.240]   We will not give to him what costs us nothing.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.800]   We wanna pay the cost.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.880]   We wanna give all that we have
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.800]   because of how beautiful this vision of heaven on earth,
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.680]   full restoration, new creation looks like.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:31.760]   I think Ananias could have never imagined
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:36.760]   just how wild, how big, how spread Saul's transformation
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.600]   would, what it would do for the gospel.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.000]   I don't think he could ever realize the impact.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.720]   See, he was just faced with a moment,
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:48.080]   with a small moment of examining what he believed
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.240]   and where his trust was.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.040]   The transformation of Saul to Paul
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.640]   would have not been a result of the sacrifice
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.700]   of just knowing things about God,
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.520]   just knowing information about Jesus.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.300]   That wouldn't be the costly sacrifice required.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.080]   The costly sacrifice that God required of Ananias
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.280]   and today that he's requiring of us
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.420]   is belief through obedience.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.620]   Costly sacrifice always calls and leads us to examine
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.000]   where it is that we really put our trust in.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.400]   Listen, we can say that we trust Jesus
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.000]   till we're blue in the face,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.760]   until we act in obedience,
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.960]   until we do something about that trust,
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.340]   until we choose to sacrifice for him.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.720]   It's just words.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.680]   It's just knowledge.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.000]   It's just information.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.200]   See, persecution comes to us all,
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.660]   but the idea of costly sacrifice
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.160]   is one that we have to choose.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.280]   That's a decision that we have to make
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.840]   based off of the belief that we have in him.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.100]   And that is why we have to get to this place
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.400]   where our belief isn't simply
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.820]   getting more information about God,
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.360]   isn't simply sitting in another service,
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.840]   isn't simply just knowing stuff.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.880]   We live in an oversaturated world of information.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.360]   There's too much information out there,
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.720]   so much information we get sick of information.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.100]   So it's not gonna be information alone
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.480]   that's gonna transform us into people
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.820]   who live in response to Jesus.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:20.220]   No, it's gonna be a call to obedience.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.140]   Disciples who trust God must act upon the belief
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.000]   and trust that we possess.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.840]   As the band comes up, I wanna read us this quote
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.180]   from Dietrich Bonhoeffer,
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.540]   someone who I've been reading a lot of recently.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:36.860]   And he says this, he's so intellectual, he's so smart.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.820]   He uses lots of big words.
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.420]   I don't understand half of what he says.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.600]   Took me a long time to make it
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.800]   through the first two chapters.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.320]   I'm probably still there.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.960]   But I put it up here so we can read it
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.720]   and really think about what he's saying,
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.440]   because this really hit me and stopped me at my core.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.520]   He says this, "With an abstract idea,
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.220]   "it is possible to enter into a relation of formal knowledge
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.140]   "to become enthusiastic about it,
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.380]   "and perhaps even to put it into practice,
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:03.660]   "but it can never be followed in personal obedience.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.780]   "Christianity without the living Christ
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:08.540]   "is inevitably Christianity without discipleship,
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.920]   "and Christianity without discipleship
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.260]   "is always Christianity without Christ."
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:19.300]   To follow, to be a disciple of Jesus in uncharted spaces,
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.820]   we have to be a people who more than just agree
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.640]   on the information that's out there about Jesus,
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.340]   but rather people who are willing to choose
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.920]   to respond with sacrificial trust,
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   even when it costs us dearly.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.180]   My question is, where is your trust today?
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.380]   What have we been adhering to?
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:46.500]   What decisions are we willing to make
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.980]   should God call us into a challenging situation?
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:53.040]   What is it that we follow?
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.820]   Are we leaning too much on the other options
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.260]   of discipleship, right?
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.260]   Are we leaning on the other ways,
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.060]   the other things like our observations?
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:09.220]   Do we follow favorable circumstances so much
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.700]   that we become risk adverse to following Jesus
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.700]   if he says it's gonna hurt a little bit?
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:18.620]   Are we leaning too much on our own understanding?
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:22.060]   Are there things that hinder us
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.860]   from actively following Jesus,
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.580]   no matter where he's calling us?
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.380]   The good thing is that if he goes there,
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.040]   then that means if we follow him there, he's still there,
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.180]   so we're good, right?
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.180]   Like if Jesus is there, then we have hope,
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.420]   then we have peace,
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.140]   and we have all the things that we need.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:40.100]   So following Jesus,
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.780]   it doesn't matter how charted and uncharted it is.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.380]   If Jesus is gonna be there, that's where you wanna be,
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.340]   right?
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.180]   Trust me, that's, if Jesus is in that situation,
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.180]   then I wanna be in that situation 'cause I know who he is.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:58.820]   So my prayer for us this morning, church,
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:03.160]   is that we would be reminded of the purposes of God,
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.100]   of his kingdom come, what it looks like on the earth today,
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.380]   that we would be reminded of all the good and all the life,
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:13.360]   all the fullness that he brings with his kingdom
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.540]   that he has inaugurated already,
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.880]   and that it would lead us to a place of deeper surrender,
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.140]   a place where our trust leads us to costly sacrifice,
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.740]   where we would be willing to offer our bodies
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.340]   as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing and acceptable
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:32.220]   unto the Lord as an act of worship in views of God mercy.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.020]   Would we be willing to respond?
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:39.260]   I ask you to go ahead and stand and we'll pray together.
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:45.160]   Jesus, we recognize that discipleship
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.940]   is not an easy thing per se.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.660]   God, we recognize that there are voices
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.820]   that are sometimes come across as louder than you.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:56.100]   Our fears can be louder, our reason can be louder,
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.280]   the conditions of the direction you've called us into
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.660]   can sometimes be louder.
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.220]   But God, I pray supernaturally,
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.540]   would you tune our ears to only hear you?
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:13.420]   Would you fix our eyes to be fixed upon you alone?
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.920]   God, that no matter how challenging, no matter how hard,
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.540]   no matter what risk or what cost,
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:26.540]   Jesus, may we choose to decide that today we will follow you.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.580]   We will follow you no matter how hard it is,
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.900]   no matter how easy it is, from green pastures into valleys.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.340]   Lord, may we be a people who are committed to following you.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.820]   And where we don't have that strength,
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.520]   Holy Spirit, would you strengthen our feet?
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.580]   Would you strengthen our minds, God?
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.700]   Would you protect us against the overthinking,
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.760]   against the doubt, against the fears
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.380]   that take us away from you?
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.460]   When our senses pull us further away from you,
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.180]   Jesus, would you be everything?
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:57.900]   Would you lead us so that we will truly follow you?
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.540]   Jesus. Amen.
