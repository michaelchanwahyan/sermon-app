1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 Let me pray this in Jesus' name.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,760
 Everyone says?

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,760
 Amen.

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,840
 Can we give Jesus a big round of applause?

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,840
 Thank you, Lord.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,640
 Have a seat, have a seat.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,640
 Welcome to the Vine.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,640
 My name's Andrew.

9
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,280
 I'm one of the pastors here, and it's great to be with you this morning.

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,760
 I want to be really honest and vulnerable with you up front here this morning and let

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,040
 you know that the topic that I want to teach on this morning is one that I'm doing out

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,120
 of a place of very deep and personal conviction.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,120
 I want to teach you today on the topic of being prepared for the persecution that may

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:49,640
 come for standing boldly for our faith in a time of historical cultural change.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,040
 I want to talk about that because I think the Lord is preparing His bride for the season

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,960
 to come, and it's something that He's been speaking to me and dealing with me in my own

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,960
 life for over the last year or so.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,840
 And in this series that we're in right now where we're looking at the values that the

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,880
 Lord placed in the disciples to enable them to be that victorious church in an uncharted

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,840
 season of sharing the gospel in the Greco-Roman Empire, I think it's this value that we're

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,680
 looking at today that I struggle with the most.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,840
 It's the value, if I could put it most distinctly, it would be this.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,520
 The value that the early church had was a personal and a communal willingness to be

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,080
 persecuted for their faith.

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,880
 A personal and a communal willingness to be persecuted for their faith.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,680
 And I think in a year where the Lord is saying to the divine church, "This is a year where

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,240
 I want you to live your faith more publicly.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,080
 It's a year where I'm moving you into an uncharted season where you're going to be out of your

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,840
 comfort zone and you're going to be in places where you've never been before."

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,880
 I think our own personal and communal willingness to be bold and courageous for the gospel,

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,720
 even though that might create some pushback, might create some critique, might create some

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,160
 adverse responses from the people that are around us.

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,240
 Our willingness, our ability to still push forward for the gospel despite the criticism

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,320
 that might come, that is going to be foundational for whether the church in Hong Kong is going

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,360
 to move forward in victory or retreat in the years ahead.

36
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:44,000
 And because this is so important, the Holy Spirit has been showing me that I lack preparation

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,280
 for it, that I personally feel that I lack the readiness that I need for what might be

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,240
 ahead for us.

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:04,400
 I know that I recognize in me just quite a bit of fear and anxiety as a church leader

40
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,360
 in this time, as somebody who menaces in the pulpit in this time.

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:20,240
 I can feel in me that tension to want to be silent when I should find my loudest voice.

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,420
 I think the reality is that the Holy Spirit has been challenging me deeply in this area

43
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,000
 because I think He wants to challenge all of us in this area.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,140
 One of the things that the Holy Spirit has been saying to me quite abruptly is He's been

45
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,040
 reminding me of the moment when Paul wrote to the church in Rome when they were under

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,640
 an incredible season of persecution, and he wrote this.

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,200
 He said, "I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation for

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,080
 those who believe."

49
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,400
 I am not ashamed of the gospel.

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,800
 The Holy Spirit has been challenging me as to whether I actually believe that, and if

51
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:06,000
 I believe that, then whether I'm going to be as bold in my time as Paul was in his.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,320
 I think that's the great challenge that sits on me as I bring this word to you today.

53
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,640
 I want you to know right up front that what I'm preaching you today is coming from a place

54
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,280
 of conviction rather than confidence.

55
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,760
 I don't stand before you arrogant, bold, and always courageous for the things of God.

56
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,280
 I stand before you as someone who's personally wrestling with the need for repentance for

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,560
 the fear that I have for being bold in my faith in this time.

58
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,680
 Maybe that resonates with you.

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,880
 Maybe the topic of persecution is one that you kind of just push to one side in your

60
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
 life.

61
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,960
 Maybe it's one that you recognize is important in our time at this time, but is one that

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,680
 you maybe haven't thought about too deeply.

63
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,360
 I wonder whether maybe some of us in this room feel that same way, that there's a sense

64
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,880
 of anxiety, sensitivity, a sense of maybe that fear that might be there because of that

65
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
 in our future.

66
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,880
 If that's the case, then I think we're all in good company here because we come submitted

67
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,580
 to the victory that is in Christ Jesus, even though at times we wrestle ourselves with

68
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,580
 how we might feel.

69
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,580
 Amen?

70
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,920
 I want to pray for us as we open the word together here this morning.

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,280
 Lord, I thank you so much for the power that is in your word.

72
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,000
 And Father, as we open Scripture, as we look at the journey that the early church had,

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,120
 as we think about our own personal lives, as we wrestle with this call that is upon

74
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:44,800
 us to live our faith more publicly in the year ahead, Lord, I want to pray for humility.

75
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,520
 I want to pray for the conviction of your word, but I also want to pray for the confidence

76
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,400
 that comes through the victory found in the cross of Christ.

77
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,760
 And Lord, out of that place of victory, we as a church might move forward boldly in a

78
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,760
 season where we need to find our loudest voice.

79
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,960
 We thank you for this in your name.

80
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,600
 Amen.

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,480
 A quick review of church history will show you that whenever God calls the church to

82
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,320
 live boldly for the faith in a time of political, cultural, societal change, persecution always

83
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,240
 comes.

84
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
 And when you see that and recognize that, you'll notice through church history that

85
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,400
 when that persecution comes, the church sometimes is strong and stands faithful.

86
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,720
 And sometimes the church is weakened and retreats.

87
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,480
 And if I think about what's happening in the globe at the moment, if we look at global,

88
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,060
 political, social, and cultural change that's, I think, happening at unprecedented rates

89
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,560
 around the world right now, I think a time has come again where the church is being tested

90
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,200
 and where the church is being asked whether it really does stand on the solid rock of

91
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,080
 Jesus Christ and his word or whether it's on the shifting sands of popular opinion and

92
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,400
 its comfort.

93
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,960
 And I truly believe that here in our city, if the church is going to be faithful and

94
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,040
 if the church is going to be victorious in the years ahead, we're going to have to embrace

95
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,540
 this same value that the early church had to embrace and wrestle with, this willingness

96
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,400
 to be persecuted for our faith.

97
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,680
 And I think one of the important things is that we just need to be prepared for it.

98
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,440
 Here's the thing that I want to say right up front.

99
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:41,960
 If we're not prepared for the challenge, the inevitable negative reaction that will come

100
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,240
 from each one of us living our faith more boldly and publicly in the year ahead, then

101
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,320
 here's what will happen.

102
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:57,140
 We will all too easily compromise the gospel and as a result, we will diminish its power.

103
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,660
 That's what will happen.

104
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,740
 If we're not prepared, if we're not ready, when it comes, we will too easily compromise

105
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:09,380
 the gospel and we will therefore ultimately diminish its power.

106
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,220
 We have to understand that in a season where God is calling his church to the uncharted,

107
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,100
 it is always a call to more radically live out the purposes and the values of the kingdom

108
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:27,060
 of God and understanding that that may therefore cause us to rub up against where the peoples

109
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:34,220
 or structures or society that may not agree or accept the thing that we're standing for.

110
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:39,620
 We have to understand that the kingdom that we believe as Christians is different from

111
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,780
 the structures that are found in this world.

112
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,660
 This has always been the Jesus way, the call to faith in Christ Jesus, the adventure of

113
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,660
 following Jesus.

114
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,360
 It's not an adventure to an easy, comfortable or straightforward life.

115
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:01,980
 It is a calling into a place where we have to walk a narrow path that few actually journey

116
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,780
 on.

117
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,740
 It's a place where we have to recognize that there is a clash of systems that happen when

118
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,980
 we want to live it faithfully in this world.

119
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,620
 I love the way that British theologian John Stott has put it.

120
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,060
 Let me read this to you from him.

121
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:22,340
 He says, "Persecution is simply the clash between two irreconcilable value systems,

122
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,380
 that the word of God and his spirit of love and the world of the flesh and its spirit

123
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,380
 of greed."

124
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:35,700
 I think that's so profoundly beautiful that it is this clash of two, I love this, irreconcilable

125
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,620
 value systems.

126
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,820
 When we understand that, we should understand, well, this is why therefore Jesus himself

127
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,180
 was persecuted for living out his message and for the way in which he lived it out and

128
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,820
 the things that he said and the way that he acted in the Greco-Roman culture around him

129
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,980
 of his day.

130
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,880
 Jesus was persecuted by every strata of society.

131
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,940
 Of course, by the Greco-Roman authorities eventually in his killing on the cross, from

132
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:06,200
 the Jewish religious authorities around him who labeled him a heretic, from the crowds

133
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,660
 that had initially gathered around him in joy and yet as his teachings got stronger

134
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:18,120
 and stronger, began to fade away, to even his disciples and his best friends, who when

135
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:25,680
 persecution really came, were the first to either betray him or deny him publicly.

136
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,780
 And Jesus understood that in the persecution he had experienced in sending out the disciples

137
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,780
 with the call of the Great Commission and this beautiful idea of what it is to live

138
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,140
 God's values in the world around us.

139
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,320
 He understood that in sending the Holy Spirit upon them to empower them in that journey,

140
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,180
 that he was necessarily sending them into the same structures, the same irreconcilable

141
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,620
 systems, the same reality that there might be persecution ahead.

142
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,860
 I love the way he says it actually in John 15, 20.

143
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
 Let me read this to you.

144
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,580
 He says, "Remember the word that I said to you," this is Jesus speaking to his disciples,

145
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,940
 "A servant is not greater than his master.

146
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,220
 If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also."

147
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,940
 And so the starting point when we come to a topic like this is that we should not be

148
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,820
 surprised.

149
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,220
 Peter actually himself writes, "Do not be surprised by the fiery trial that you're going

150
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,580
 through."

151
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,980
 The church should not be caught unawares.

152
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,140
 We should not be surprised by the reality that there are two irreconcilable value systems

153
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,380
 and that we're going to rub up against it.

154
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,460
 That doesn't mean that we go out looking for persecution.

155
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,260
 Hear this, the goal of the Christian is not to find persecution.

156
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,480
 The goal of the Christian is to be obedient to Jesus and submit our lives to him.

157
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,140
 But the reality is as we live the goal and the purposes of our faith, the reality is

158
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:53,380
 there is an inevitable clash that will lead perhaps to some true and real persecution.

159
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,500
 Our starting point is to be prepared.

160
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,740
 And this was the thought for the early church as they began to disciple their church.

161
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,580
 They had heard Jesus say exactly this in John 15, 20, and they went into raising up leaders

162
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:13,300
 for the church and the Greek and Roman culture around them with this particular readiness,

163
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,060
 with a preparation to be persecuted.

164
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:23,020
 I want to read you how Paul does this so beautifully, I think, for one of his young prodigies, Timothy.

165
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:29,420
 And this is right when Paul is sending Timothy out to be a pastor in the church of Ephesus.

166
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,300
 Timothy was not there when Jesus was ministering.

167
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,020
 Timothy came later, was raised up, came to faith, and Paul then sends him out to do the

168
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,940
 work of church.

169
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,180
 Notice what he says to him here in 2 Timothy 3 verse 10.

170
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,380
 He says, "You, however," speaking of Timothy, "know all about my teaching, my way of life,

171
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:55,060
 my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, endurance, my persecutions, my sufferings.

172
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:01,420
 What kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, the persecutions I endured.

173
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,540
 Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them."

174
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,540
 Notice that.

175
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,580
 He didn't say, "The Lord rescued me from some of them, from all of these persecutions."

176
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,660
 In fact, everyone, notice this, "who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will

177
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,940
 be persecuted."

178
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,700
 Isn't that a happy verse?

179
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,140
 We don't like to teach on these verses.

180
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,220
 Everyone, that includes you, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus

181
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,860
 will be persecuted, he says.

182
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,500
 "While evil men and imposters will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived."

183
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,020
 In other words, the church is going to suffer persecution and everybody on the other side

184
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,260
 will be seen to rise.

185
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,380
 You notice this?

186
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,820
 Church will feel like this, everybody else is going to feel like this.

187
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,460
 And then he says, "But as for you, continue in what you have learned and become convinced

188
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,660
 of because you know those from whom you have learned it.

189
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,900
 And how from infancy you have known the holy scriptures which are able to make you wise

190
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,420
 for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ."

191
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,900
 I love what Paul does here.

192
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,100
 He starts out by saying to his young mentee, "Okay, you know how I've lived my life.

193
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
 You know all the good things.

194
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,260
 You know my endurance, my patience, my loving, the way I've ministered the gospel.

195
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,060
 You've seen all the good things, Timothy, but you've also seen the bad and ugly things.

196
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,620
 You've seen the sufferings I've had to endure, the persecutions."

197
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,260
 When Paul's writing this to Timothy, this is towards the end of Paul's life, he's been

198
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,540
 arrested, he's been beaten, he's been shipwrecked, he's been imprisoned.

199
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,940
 I mean, basically everything that could happen to him other than death has happened to him

200
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,340
 because of his faith in Christ Jesus.

201
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,300
 And so he's writing to Timothy, he's saying, "You know all about this.

202
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,660
 You know about the persecutions.

203
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,860
 You know about the sufferings."

204
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,660
 And he says this, "Anyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."

205
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,580
 Notice what he says here.

206
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,380
 He does not say everyone who believes in Jesus will be persecuted.

207
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,820
 Come on, church.

208
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,380
 He says everyone who wants to live a godly life.

209
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:08,180
 In other words, there's a choice like Ellison was talking about last week.

210
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,900
 There's a choice before the church whether we will just believe in Jesus or live a godly

211
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,980
 life in Jesus.

212
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,500
 And believing in Jesus is easy.

213
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,140
 Living a godly life in Jesus, that's a whole different thing.

214
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,860
 And Paul is trying to get across to Timothy, "Here's what I want you to do.

215
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,580
 I want you to live a godly life in Jesus, but when you do so, don't be surprised that

216
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,700
 it's going to be hard.

217
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,680
 If you want easy, don't live a godly life in Christ Jesus."

218
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,020
 And he's saying this to Timothy because he knows what Timothy's about to go through.

219
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,660
 And the godly life is defined for Paul like he had just explained.

220
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:50,060
 This loving life, this life of living before the world, the hope of Christ Jesus, wanting

221
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,700
 to forgive your enemies and love those who persecute you, wanting to live a person of

222
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:01,220
 radical forgiveness and grace, wanting to be yeast in dough, wanting to share the gospel

223
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,300
 because you want to see people come to relationship with Jesus, wanting to stand for the things

224
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,000
 that the kingdom stands for, doing it from a place of love, not from a pace of rebellion

225
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,340
 or wanting to disrupt the world, but from a place of loving the world.

226
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,640
 I want to love this world so much that I will not be ashamed of the gospel.

227
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:27,500
 So what Paul's saying is, if you want to live a public life of faith, then you need to realize

228
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,940
 that you're going to be persecuted, which if you follow Paul, this is really good, you

229
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,100
 might want to write this down.

230
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,740
 Here's how to avoid persecution, live a private life of Christ Jesus.

231
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:44,900
 Take your faith, which is a bright light, and put a basket on top of it.

232
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,060
 That's the best way to avoid persecution.

233
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:55,620
 If you want an easy life, just believe in him and know that one day you'll go to heaven.

234
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,340
 And if you believe in him, you will one day go to heaven.

235
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,020
 Belief in Jesus is so important.

236
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,940
 But if you want to live the way in which the Bible is saying we should live our faith,

237
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,900
 then you do not take your light and put it under a basket, but you let your light shine

238
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,780
 before all this world.

239
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,460
 And if you're going to commit to that, then you have to recognize it's not going to be

240
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,380
 easy.

241
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,780
 Paul says that sufferings will come and that these sufferings will be hard.

242
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,620
 Paul's not saying that every suffering you will ever experience as a Christian should

243
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,620
 be labeled persecution.

244
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,300
 Because sometimes we suffer for our own sin.

245
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,040
 Sometimes we suffer because we make mistakes and bad decisions.

246
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,700
 Sometimes we suffer because of somebody else's sin and their bad mistakes.

247
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,880
 He's not saying every suffering that you ever have is a persecution.

248
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,860
 I think sometimes the church can be a little bit like that.

249
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,660
 It's like, "Oh man, I'm suffering so bad.

250
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,500
 I'm under persecution because I lost my job."

251
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,180
 And it's like, "Well, maybe you lost your job because you did something dumb."

252
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,180
 Are you with me?

253
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,300
 It's not everything that we do is therefore labeled persecution.

254
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,860
 What Paul's saying is if you live a godly life and in living a godly life, in other

255
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:15,300
 words, as you devote yourself to Christ and live in a way of devotion to Christ and persecution,

256
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,300
 suffering comes, you can label that persecution.

257
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,420
 It is the suffering that comes from our devotion to Christ.

258
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,020
 And that devotion to Christ is the preeminent thing that we do.

259
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
 And the suffering can be real.

260
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,140
 It can be emotional and psychological suffering, name-calling, being made to feel like on the

261
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,780
 outside of things, being shunned by the people that you used to be accepted by.

262
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,600
 Maybe those in your family or those in your offices turning their back on you or saying

263
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,820
 things behind your back or even saying things to your face.

264
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,380
 It can be emotionally and psychological suffering.

265
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,180
 It can be like for Paul, physical suffering, beatings and floggings, which actually still

266
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,140
 occurs in our world today because of faith in Christ Jesus.

267
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,780
 Or maybe in our level, it might be losing our jobs because of the value systems that

268
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,700
 we hold and how they've rubbed up against the employer that we're working for.

269
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,620
 Or perhaps our financial challenges that might come to us because of our devotion in Christ

270
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,620
 Jesus.

271
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,340
 There could be a number of ways that it can happen physically for us.

272
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,500
 I think it's also spiritual.

273
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,660
 We can have spiritual suffering.

274
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,020
 We can have an attack from the enemy because of the way in which we're living our lives.

275
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,100
 That's a very real thing as well.

276
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,540
 And then there are some dramatic things that take place.

277
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:33,540
 There's even imprisonment and death, not just in the first century, which we see throughout

278
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:40,040
 the pages of Acts, but in our world today, in countries not too far from this one.

279
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,680
 That is still happening today.

280
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,860
 So there's this idea that there's this suffering that's going to happen.

281
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,980
 And here's the thing that I felt the Holy Spirit been challenging me around.

282
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:57,780
 Am I really, and I mean really, prepared to suffer for my faith?

283
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:03,460
 Am I really prepared to take what might come, not again because I'm looking for it, not

284
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:09,500
 because I'm going out there to stir up trouble, but as I'm living a godly life for Christ

285
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,940
 Jesus in the world that is as it is right now, am I really willing to press on with

286
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,860
 my faith even if suffering might come?

287
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:27,820
 Or do I recognize within me the need to fit in too much, the need to be accepted too much,

288
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:33,820
 the need to not want to upset people too much, the need of fear of what people might think

289
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,620
 around me too much, or whatever it might be.

290
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,020
 That sits on my spirit and it weighs on me.

291
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,260
 And here's how I think I've been processing it.

292
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,660
 I've recognized, and this is just an honest confession before you, I've recognized that

293
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,980
 sometimes my faith is too shallow.

294
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,980
 It's too shallow.

295
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,080
 And what I mean by that is that at the nearest hint of somebody who might be upset at me

296
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:06,440
 because of something I've said, I am tempted to assimilate to that person.

297
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,660
 And as I've been wrestling with this, I felt the Holy Spirit has led me to a personal passage.

298
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,620
 I want to read this to you because it might resonate with some of you as well.

299
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,580
 In Matthew 13, there's a beautiful parable of the sower.

300
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,860
 You know the parable probably, the scattering of seed and some of it falls on certain ground,

301
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,340
 rocky ground and soil that doesn't accept it and other soils that do.

302
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,780
 And then Jesus explains the parable a little bit later in the passage.

303
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,460
 I want to pick up from verse 20.

304
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,820
 Notice this, he says, "The one who has received the seed that fell on rocky soil or rocky

305
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:44,500
 ground is the person who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.

306
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,460
 But since he has no root, he lasts only for a short time.

307
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:57,140
 When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away."

308
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,900
 Jesus led me to that passage and this was like Jesus, you know those moments where you

309
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,100
 know that Jesus is lovingly convicting you.

310
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,500
 And he led me to that passage and he's like, "Andrew, you're kind of like the rocky ground

311
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,660
 sometimes.

312
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,500
 You're like the rocky ground where my word comes to you and you accept it with joy, but

313
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,500
 there is not a lot of root sometimes.

314
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,660
 And when there's not root, when the wind comes and the storms come and the stuff comes, it's

315
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,100
 very easy for that word just to get lost in you."

316
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,960
 And I recognize that I wrestle with this.

317
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,060
 And so as the Lord brought that passage to mind, I began to pray and ask the Lord, "Why

318
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,420
 am I shallow?

319
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,420
 What's going on?

320
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,460
 What keeps me shallow sometimes in my faith?"

321
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,460
 And he came and said something to me, which I journaled.

322
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,860
 I want to read this to you.

323
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,860
 He said this.

324
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,580
 I'm just being very honest with you, by the way, today.

325
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,580
 I hope that's okay.

326
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,020
 Welcome to the Vine.

327
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,420
 "Andrew, I am both your Savior and your Lord.

328
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:58,100
 You need to be careful you don't just live as if I am only your Savior."

329
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,140
 And I think this is so profound, or at least it was for me, that there is this idea that

330
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,260
 He is our Savior and our Lord.

331
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:11,460
 But so often, this is what keeps us shallow, we just keep Him being our Savior and we don't

332
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,220
 submit to Him as Lord.

333
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,960
 And when that happens, here's what it is.

334
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,900
 We like the fact that we have that ticket out of here.

335
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,520
 We like the fact that our sins are forgiven.

336
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,220
 We like the fact that we have someone to go to, to offer, and to know that we are forgiven

337
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:32,400
 and redeemed and saved, but then we fail to fully submit our everyday life to Him.

338
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,220
 And so He's our Savior, yes, but can we actually say that He's our Lord?

339
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,140
 And I think what Jesus was saying to me, and perhaps what He's trying to say to us as the

340
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,460
 church here this morning, is that how we go deep is we move beyond just the recognition

341
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,060
 of Him as our Savior, and because He is our Savior, because of the work of the cross,

342
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,100
 because of the grace of forgiveness, we don't keep it cheap.

343
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,940
 And we actually press to a place of deep-rooted obedience and submission to His laws, to His

344
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,660
 love, to His challenges, to His conviction, to His Word, living a godly life out of a

345
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,020
 place of reverent submission to Him.

346
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,940
 That's the root.

347
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,500
 And so Jesus must be for us at the Vine as we move into this time of uncharted both Savior

348
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:23,100
 and Lord, and if you're anything like me, perhaps you get this part well and this one

349
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,420
 you struggle with sometimes.

350
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,820
 And in that, we have to wrestle with the honesty of coming to Him in confession and saying,

351
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,980
 "I know You are Savior and Lord.

352
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:42,140
 Hold me back from just living like You're my Savior only."

353
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,980
 As the church wrestles with this, I think it begins to position us in a place where

354
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,940
 we can begin to respond, because this is not just a personal thing, it's also a communal

355
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,940
 thing.

356
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,980
 We can be churches that are what I would call rocky-ground churches.

357
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:03,980
 Oh, eager to worship, eager to put our hands up, eager to have a great moment on a Sunday

358
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,140
 together, and yet where's the depth?

359
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,140
 Where is the obedience?

360
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,500
 Where is the submission to what the Father is saying amongst us?

361
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,740
 And I do not want the Vine to be a rocky-ground church.

362
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,460
 And I recognize I don't want to be a rocky-ground person.

363
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,980
 How do we change this?

364
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,340
 I was reminded of something I read recently by Leonard Ravenhill.

365
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
 Let me read you what he said.

366
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,340
 I think this is so challenging.

367
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,260
 "The early church was married to poverty, prisons, and persecutions.

368
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:38,420
 Today, the church is married to prosperity, personality, and popularity."

369
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:44,020
 I think when that happens, a church has Jesus as their Savior, but not as their Lord.

370
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,380
 When that happens, we seek all the benefits of relationship with Him without any of the

371
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,820
 responsibility.

372
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,140
 I was in a conversation a few years ago with an incredible pastor who lives in an Asian

373
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,660
 country that is well-known for its persecution of Christians.

374
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,140
 And we were talking about the church, the global church.

375
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,500
 And as we were in conversation together about the global church, he said this thing to me.

376
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,660
 He said, "The church in the West has had years of prosperity, and it has weakened."

377
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,620
 And he says, "It's interesting, because the church in my country has had years of persecution,

378
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,500
 but we have only strengthened."

379
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,940
 And then he said this, and this blew my mind.

380
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:32,360
 He said, "Persecution is much better than prosperity when it comes to the gospel."

381
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,700
 And I felt a deep conviction when he said that, and I feel it now as I'm sharing it

382
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,120
 with you.

383
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,060
 And this conviction of saying true revival will come when we actually honor and understand

384
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:51,580
 that, when we're willing to live a godly life in Christ Jesus boldly and courageously, despite

385
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:58,020
 how that will rub us up against that irreconcilable value system, and yet do so in a place of

386
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,100
 love, even in a place of joy.

387
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,300
 How do we do that?

388
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,820
 Notice what Paul says here in this passage.

389
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,140
 He lays it out for Timothy.

390
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,860
 He's not trying to give Timothy a hard time, because he says, "But as for you," verse 14,

391
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,700
 "continue in what you have learned and become convinced of, because you know those from

392
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,060
 whom you have learned it."

393
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,060
 That's the first thing.

394
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,060
 He says, "You want to go deep."

395
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,680
 He says, "Continue to meet together like this.

396
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,100
 Continue to submit yourself under the Word of God in a public setting.

397
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,860
 Continue to have your small group and have fellowship in your small group.

398
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,460
 Continue to learn under those that you have respect for, those that you have seen, how

399
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,820
 they've lived their lives.

400
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,260
 Continue to submit yourself under an environment where you are learning and growing from the

401
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,100
 people that you respect, whether that's a church on a Sunday, whether that's a small

402
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
 group during the week."

403
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,180
 He's basically saying, "Look, commit to that."

404
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:55,500
 But then notice what he says, verse 15, "And how from empathy you have known the Holy Scriptures."

405
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,140
 So he's saying there's a two-fold rootedness that takes place for you.

406
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:05,020
 If you want to grow rooted in the gospel to live a godly life, it comes from this moment,

407
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,060
 submitting yourselves in fellowship to a church community, but it also comes from taking up

408
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,540
 your own personal responsibility of being in the Word of God.

409
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,180
 The Holy Scriptures that he says to Timothy, "You've known since you're young.

410
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,680
 Don't give up on the Scriptures that you've read, that you've studied, that you've done

411
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,020
 the hard work in, and don't give up on what you've learned from those around you that

412
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
 you respect."

413
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,620
 Those two-pronged things.

414
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:34,300
 That's the way that you put roots down deep in the kingdom of God, no matter what might

415
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,580
 come.

416
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,140
 And I think it's those two things.

417
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,980
 The understanding of who Jesus was and how they had been with Jesus, they had learned

418
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,780
 from him and they'd seen him, as well as their own reflections and understanding of the Scriptures

419
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,020
 enabled the early church to stand up with this value of the willingness to be persecuted

420
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,580
 for their faith.

421
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,140
 Let me take you just quickly to a passage where this gets illuminated to us from Acts

422
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,020
 chapter 5.

423
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,020
 Acts chapter 5, starting in verse 27, says this.

424
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,700
 Before I read it, let me tell you a little bit.

425
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,160
 I'm getting too ahead of myself.

426
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,020
 This is the moment just about two or three months after the disciples have seen the death

427
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,580
 and resurrection of Jesus and seen Jesus ascend.

428
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,340
 It's about two or three months after the sending of the Holy Spirit.

429
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,260
 And remember what Jesus has said to them.

430
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,620
 He said, "You'll be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the world."

431
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,600
 Jerusalem to begin with.

432
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,020
 And so here's what the disciples are doing.

433
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,980
 They're spending every day in the temple courts in the heart of Jerusalem.

434
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:37,660
 They're sharing that Jesus is the Messiah, which was a radical thing to do in the temple,

435
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:43,020
 the very center of the Jewish faith for the people who are looking for their Messiah.

436
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,760
 And the disciples, this small band of people, are coming and sharing every day in the outer

437
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,940
 courts of the temple with whoever who would listen to them that Jesus is their Messiah.

438
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:58,500
 And this has become so much that the Sanhedrin, who are the sort of religious leaders of the

439
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,780
 day, 71 men that were leading the temple of that day, they had already told the disciples,

440
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,540
 "Stop talking about Jesus."

441
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,900
 But the disciples were like, "We're not going to stop talking about Jesus."

442
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,540
 And so we pick up the story from the point where the Sanhedrin brings them in to talk

443
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,620
 to them, verse 27.

444
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,980
 "Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned

445
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,980
 by the high priest.

446
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,620
 'Hey, we gave you strict orders not to teach in his name,' he said.

447
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:28,020
 'Yet you have filled Jerusalem,'" notice this, "'filled Jerusalem with your teaching and

448
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,260
 are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.'

449
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:38,340
 Peter and the other apostles replied, 'We must obey God rather than people.

450
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,820
 The God of our fathers raised Jesus from the dead, whom you had killed by hanging him on

451
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,820
 a tree.

452
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,700
 God exalted him to his own right hand as prince and savior, that he might give repentance

453
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,980
 and forgiveness of sins to Israel.

454
00:30:50,980 --> 00:31:02,140
 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those

455
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,140
 who obey him.'"

456
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,140
 I love this.

457
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,500
 The Sanhedrin are saying, "You need to stop teaching Jesus."

458
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,900
 And the apostles say, "We must obey God rather than people."

459
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,740
 Peter stands up in front of the people that could literally have him stoned, and he says,

460
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,900
 "We're going to obey God more than we're going to obey you."

461
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,060
 Now you've got to understand, this is the same Peter who just about three months prior

462
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:32,020
 to this, when he sees Jesus get arrested, denies him three times.

463
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:37,260
 Denies him three times, runs away, and returns to being a fisherman, and gives up the whole

464
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,880
 cool that Christ had placed upon him.

465
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,980
 He goes away from it all, and in fear, he basically hides.

466
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:51,380
 I think at this time, Peter saw Jesus as his savior, but not his Lord.

467
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,900
 And because he had seen Jesus as his savior, when Jesus was arrested, he was like, "This

468
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,020
 is going to end really badly for Jesus.

469
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:05,060
 It could potentially end really badly for me, so I guess maybe he's not Jesus, the Messiah.

470
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,100
 He's not the one that we had thought he was.

471
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,340
 He's not our savior."

472
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:13,820
 And when Jesus dies on the cross, before Peter is seeing him in his resurrection, he runs.

473
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,180
 He flees away.

474
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:21,780
 And then Jesus, in his resurrection, meets him on the beach, restores to him, gives him

475
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,580
 his calling to be one of the fathers of the church, and just three months later, here's

476
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,260
 Peter standing before the very persons that three months prior he was afraid of, and now

477
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,180
 he's standing in front of them and saying, "We're going to obey God over you."

478
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:41,340
 Something has so radically happened in Peter that now he sees Jesus not just as his savior,

479
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,100
 but also his Lord.

480
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,540
 And because he's his Lord, he's willing to submit everything under the kingship of Christ

481
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,300
 Jesus, so much so that he can stand before his people and say, "I'm going to always put

482
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
 God first."

483
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,620
 Now notice, Peter is not trying to incite some revolution against the powers of the

484
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,020
 day.

485
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,700
 He's not trying to say, "Hey, we're just going to disregard all of you guys."

486
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,180
 He's not trying to say, "Look, we should work against the laws of the land."

487
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,540
 He's not doing that.

488
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,180
 I think Peter has a deep respect for his people.

489
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,020
 I think he's got a deep respect for the laws of his land.

490
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,380
 He's not advocating some rebellion against the laws of this land.

491
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:24,100
 What he is saying, though, he's saying, "If it ever comes down to it, where the word of

492
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:31,500
 my king and the word of this world clash, I'm going to side with my king."

493
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,500
 That's what he's saying.

494
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,060
 And he's saying, "That's where my obedience will be.

495
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,220
 That's where my life will be.

496
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,140
 That's where I will submit myself to over and above everything else."

497
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,460
 And we can hear that and go, "Yeah, that sounds great.

498
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,740
 Oh, I always would put Christ first."

499
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,180
 And then persecution comes.

500
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,740
 You know, I think it's actually really easy for us to put God first when it comes with

501
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,540
 very little personal cost to actually living it out.

502
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:02,340
 But when putting Christ first comes at deep sacrifice and cost, I know that we are so

503
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:11,820
 easily tempted to choose what is safe rather than what is faithful.

504
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,820
 And Peter is standing before his people and saying, "I will always put God first.

505
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,060
 I didn't three months ago."

506
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,380
 I love how beautiful Peter is.

507
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,780
 He's like, "I'm not perfect.

508
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,540
 Three months ago, man, I even denied him three times.

509
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,060
 But now I stand before you.

510
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,740
 He's my savior and my Lord."

511
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,740
 So how do we do this?

512
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,740
 How do we practically?

513
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:37,740
 I know I'm going a bit long, but how do we practically put a word like this, begin to

514
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:43,060
 put it and shape it into our lives in the months and years ahead for us here in Hong

515
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,500
 Kong, a place that we love, a place that we want to see flourish and grow?

516
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,540
 Well, I want to suggest a few quick things.

517
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,380
 First of all, number one, do not be surprised, right?

518
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:57,380
 Do not be surprised by the reality of these two irreconcilable value systems that are

519
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,700
 going to rub up against each other.

520
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,820
 That's the first one.

521
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,260
 We've seen that throughout our time together today.

522
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,300
 Here's the second one.

523
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,500
 Pray for the grace.

524
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,340
 Pray for the grace to be able to stand up against whatever might come to you.

525
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
 But I want you to see this.

526
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,100
 The grace that Christ gives us for persecution has two directions to it.

527
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,140
 The first direction is the grace that we need to stand up under persecution.

528
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,660
 But the second direction of the grace is the one we often forget about.

529
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:32,500
 That grace should also then work through our lives outwards towards our persecutor.

530
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,420
 Jesus said, "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."

531
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,780
 And so if we get to stand up under that clash of value system, we should be asking for the

532
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:48,940
 grace not just to stand up against it, but for the grace to be able to withstand whatever

533
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,620
 persecution might come.

534
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,180
 It's really interesting because Peter, after saying this thing he says, they're actually

535
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,900
 flogged and they're beaten so badly.

536
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,380
 And they leave from that place of being flogged and beaten and they say these words.

537
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:08,780
 They say, "We rejoice that we have been counted worthy of suffering for the name."

538
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,940
 If I was the disciples in that moment, if I was Peter, I would have left with these

539
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,940
 emotions.

540
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,940
 Not joy.

541
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,900
 My emotions would be anger.

542
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,980
 My emotion would be hate.

543
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,320
 My emotion would be, "How do I get revenge here?"

544
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,460
 Their emotion was rejoicing.

545
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,460
 Joy.

546
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,380
 Joy that they've been counted worthy of suffering for the name.

547
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,300
 Another way of saying it, joy for realizing that in living a godly life, the persecution

548
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,980
 has told them that they're on the right track.

549
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,100
 They're on the narrow path.

550
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,740
 There's great joy in that.

551
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,460
 Here's the third thing.

552
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,600
 Deepen your relationship with Jesus.

553
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,380
 The easiest way I can say it is this.

554
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:51,660
 You will never be prepared to suffer for something or someone you do not know.

555
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,700
 Come on, church.

556
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,500
 We are only prepared to suffer for something that we know and that we love and that we

557
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,940
 believe is valuable to stand for.

558
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,380
 So as we deepen our roots in Christ Jesus, that's the greatest way that we prepare ourselves

559
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,260
 for whatever might come.

560
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,540
 Here's the fourth thing.

561
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:14,180
 Replace our fear of people with a healthy fear of the Lord.

562
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,540
 It's so easy for us to feel afraid of what everybody might think or afraid of what might

563
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,460
 happen or afraid of the opinions of those around us.

564
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,460
 And that's a very real thing.

565
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,620
 And I've already told you that's something I struggle with a lot.

566
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,340
 Replacing that fear with a healthy fear of the Lord.

567
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,340
 This is Peter, right?

568
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:34,500
 "I will obey God over human beings because I put my fear, my ultimate trust, my ultimate

569
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,900
 reverence, my ultimate worship under my king rather than under any human authority structure.

570
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,620
 Ultimately, that's what I do," says Peter.

571
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,820
 We need to replace our fear of people with a healthy fear of the Lord.

572
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,580
 Here's the final one and I'll close with this.

573
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:58,860
 We need to not forget that the church is victorious.

574
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,420
 Not forget that we as God's people hold the victory.

575
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,940
 And that even though we might, as Paul would write to the church in Corinth, be on the

576
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,860
 dying side, the people around us are on the rising side.

577
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,920
 That they get to see the gospel and they get to come into relationship with Jesus.

578
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,220
 They get salvation and a Lord.

579
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,920
 And in seeing people being brought into the kingdom of God, we're willing to take the

580
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,220
 dying side if they're going to have the rising side.

581
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,440
 We're willing to live a godly life for Christ Jesus, even though it might rub us up against

582
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,600
 the grain of sin, simply because we long to see the victory that is found in the church

583
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
 of Christ.

584
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,120
 That Jesus would say, "I've built this church and the gates of hell will not come against

585
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
 it."

586
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,440
 Paul, as he's writing to the church, he finishes with these powerful words.

587
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,680
 And I want to read these over you.

588
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,920
 So as we close, can I invite you to stand with me?

589
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,920
 And I want to read these words over you because I'm hoping that some of what I've taught you

590
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,280
 today has been helpful for you.

591
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,140
 I'm hoping that it has been challenging to you.

592
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:11,100
 But I'm hoping that you will leave here not in a place of fear, but in a place of worship.

593
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,340
 That you leave here going, "I want a Savior and a Lord."

594
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,120
 That you leave here saying, "I know it's not going to be always easy.

595
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,440
 That's the narrow path, but I'm not doing it alone.

596
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,420
 I'm doing it with a room filled with people like this.

597
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,520
 I'm doing it in a church community that loves me and that will help me.

598
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,680
 I'm doing it amongst people who will pray for me.

599
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,360
 But more than that, I'm doing it as a victor, not as someone in defeat."

600
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,800
 Notice what Paul says over his church.

601
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,100
 And I want to encourage you just to close your eyes as I read this to you.

602
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:48,100
 He says, "Because those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.

603
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,660
 For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received

604
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,440
 a spirit of sonship.

605
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,180
 And by him we cry, 'Abba, Father.'

606
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:04,620
 For the Spirit himself testifies with our own spirit that we are God's children.

607
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:10,500
 Now if we are the children, then we are also his heirs, heirs of God and co-heirs with

608
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,500
 Christ.

609
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:17,460
 If indeed we share in his sufferings, in order that we may also share in his glory.

610
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:23,300
 For I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that

611
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,180
 will be revealed in us.

612
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:31,460
 No, for in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

613
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:37,620
 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels nor demons, neither present

614
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:44,020
 nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all of creation

615
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:52,060
 will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

616
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,220
 Father, I pray for your church.

617
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,700
 I pray for the vine, for these incredible people that you love.

618
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,340
 I pray for myself.

619
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:06,420
 I pray that we would take conviction, that we would turn it into repentance, and that

620
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,580
 out of a place of repentance, we would move forward in glory, Lord.

621
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,140
 I want to pray, Lord, for a resurrected church.

622
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:22,260
 Lord, I want to pray a glimpse, the temptation to the rocky ground church, to the rocky ground

623
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,340
 Christian, the temptations that I have had to battle with.

624
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:32,540
 Lord, I want to pray for the rising of a conquering church, Lord, the church that knows that we

625
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:38,260
 are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus, that as his forgiveness and his spirit and

626
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:44,300
 his power comes upon us, and as we choose to live a godly life for him, not out of rebellion,

627
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,780
 not because we're seeking some persecution, but because we so love the world that Jesus

628
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:55,460
 was sent here, and that we have a gospel and a story to proclaim in the world around us.

629
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:02,380
 Lord, as we stand on the victory of the risen Jesus and the power of the Spirit in us, Lord,

630
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:08,140
 we will stand.

631
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:14,180
 So Father, I want to pray a blessing over each person here today.

632
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:19,820
 I want to pray the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit

633
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,580
 would be their rear guard.

634
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,020
 I pray that you would go before them, you would be around them, and that you would be

635
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,640
 behind them.

636
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,620
 And that, Lord, if anyone in this room right now is under a place of persecution for their

637
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:37,380
 faith, Lord, we want to pray as the church of Jesus Christ for them.

638
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,260
 We want to pray a lifting right now off of the oppression that the enemy would want to

639
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,260
 bring upon them, and we want to pray hope and faith and life.

640
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,740
 Lord, we want to pray that they would find themselves being able to stand firm in whatever

641
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,260
 persecution they may be struggling with at this time.

642
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,540
 And Lord, we want to pray that we would be all for your glory.

643
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,860
 All for your glory.

644
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,420
 All for your glory.

645
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:10,620
 And Lord, the final thing I want to pray, I want to pray for anyone here who recognizes

646
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,980
 that they have you as their Savior, but not as your Lord.

647
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:20,460
 Lord, I want to pray for anyone here who recognizes that you are their Savior, but they do not

648
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,060
 and they know that they struggle with submitting themselves fully to your Lordship, to your

649
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,060
 kingship.

650
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:32,900
 Lord, I want to pray that as you take them deeper this year in seasons that are uncharted,

651
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,460
 that their obedience and submission to you as their King would be the place of their

652
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:41,060
 greatest joy like it was for Peter.

653
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:46,140
 And Lord, in that place of overwhelming joy, we would move forward.

654
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,580
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

655
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,580
 Amen.

656
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,580
 Amen.

657
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:51,580
 Amen.

658
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,420
 Amen.

659
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,260
 Amen.

660
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,500
