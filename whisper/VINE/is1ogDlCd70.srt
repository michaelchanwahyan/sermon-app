1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 a redemptive story of Jesus Christ,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,560
 and that celebrates in the freedom and grace

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,360
 that such a story brings.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,440
 This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,200
 but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,640
 desiring for God's kingdom to take root

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,520
 and bear fruit in local soil.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,760
 A church that sees salvation as holistic,

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,560
 transforming God's people for God's work

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,580
 and equipping a generation to represent God's heart

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,400
 to the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the persecuted.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,280
 Imagine this church committed to seeing the family

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,620
 as integral to all that it's called to be and do,

14
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,020
 involving intentional, committed,

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,900
 and authentic relationships across all levels.

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,800
 It is the sort of place where both the young

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,200
 and the old feel cared for, supported, and equipped.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,520
 A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,800
 come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,480
 that honors and embraces a richness in diversity

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,760
 that marks us as the body of Christ.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,280
 It is a church that is willing to innovate

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,800
 and express faith creatively,

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,000
 reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,360
 as glory to Him.

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,700
 A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,720
 and passionate to see this invade

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,400
 all aspects of their lives,

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,240
 where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,680
 rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
 A church that does not make its Sunday services

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,000
 the exclamation mark of its existence,

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,240
 but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,800
 a time of service, love, and engagement

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,920
 that inspires and emboldens all equally

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,080
 for the conversation that lies ahead.

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,240
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,520
 This is our city.

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,020
 This is our church.

40
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,320
 This is our home.

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,380
 - Good morning, church.

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,600
 It is so good to see you.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,920
 Welcome.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,760
 Hey, if you're looking for a place,

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,880
 you can find a seat right now.

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,160
 Yeah, so my name is Tim.

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,520
 I'm one of the pastors here.

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,240
 And every week, we come here to gather,

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,120
 to explore who Jesus is,

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,160
 to understand what it means to know Him, to follow Him,

51
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,540
 and to also lift up His name and praise.

52
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,760
 So as I was praying and preparing for today,

53
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,920
 I was thinking of a friend of mine who is a worship leader,

54
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,920
 and he does something that I always find powerful,

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,080
 and I actually wanna do that with you.

56
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,600
 Does that sound good?

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,520
 Yes?

58
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,520
 Right, so he encourages people to give God thanks,

59
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,840
 but what he does is he says this.

60
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,080
 He's like, if you are breathing,

61
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,960
 you have something to be thankful for.

62
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,560
 If you slept in a bed last night,

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,040
 you have something to be thankful for.

64
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,280
 If you ate a meal this morning,

65
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,280
 you have something to be thankful for, 'cause God is good.

66
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,200
 He is the provider of everything we have.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,280
 And for us, the truth is a lot of times,

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,800
 there are challenges that we face, right?

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,280
 There are things that even we're facing right now,

70
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,600
 and so it's easy to just focus on them.

71
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,440
 There's actually still a lot of things

72
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,840
 that we can give God praise for.

73
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,840
 So what I wanna encourage you right now,

74
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,600
 and children, this is for you as well.

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,840
 I want you to think of two things that you are thankful for

76
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,440
 and actually turn to your neighbor

77
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,200
 and tell them what you are thankful for.

78
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,040
 Does that sound good?

79
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,920
 Can we do that?

80
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
 Two things you're thankful for.

81
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,680
 Let's do that right now.

82
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,400
 All right, hey, I would love to hear

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,840
 like one or two things that you said.

84
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,160
 So would somebody be willing to share,

85
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,640
 what are you thankful for?

86
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,240
 Family, okay, what else?

87
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,520
 Your wife, oh, he's scoring some points.

88
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,200
 Good job, Kieran.

89
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,360
 What else?

90
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:49,880
 For the people serving here,

91
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,320
 yes, we are so thankful for them.

92
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,880
 You know, when we come to worship,

93
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,160
 actually one way of entering into God's presence

94
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,240
 is by giving thanks and by praising him.

95
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,560
 And so I wanna actually prepare our hearts right now.

96
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,920
 There's a verse from Psalm 100, verse four.

97
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,440
 It says, "Enter his gates with thanksgiving

98
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,520
 "and his courts with praise.

99
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,840
 "Give thanks to him and praise his name."

100
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,320
 So I wanna invite everyone to stand

101
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,000
 and would love to pray for us

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,880
 as we prepare our hearts for worship.

103
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:31,840
 Jesus, we thank you that you are so good to us.

104
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,720
 You have given us so much.

105
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,960
 You have given us everything.

106
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,560
 You've given us family, you've given us spouses,

107
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,320
 you've given us people who serve,

108
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,880
 you died for our sins, you gave us breath, Lord.

109
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,360
 And we right now just wanna turn around

110
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,000
 and just give you praise 'cause you are worthy of it.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,440
 You deserve it.

112
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,560
 You deserve our songs.

113
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,400
 You deserve our thanksgiving.

114
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
 And right now, Holy Spirit,

115
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,960
 we just wanna welcome your presence.

116
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,680
 We wanna welcome your presence.

117
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,600
 And we wanna turn our hearts and our attention to you.

118
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
 I pray all this in your name, Jesus, amen.

119
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,000
 (gentle music)

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:43,800

 We forget how great God is.

292
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,840
 You know it's our circumstances that are weighing us down.

293
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,360
 It's sometimes it's a battle in our minds.

294
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,280
 But God is the miracle worker.

295
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,720
 He is the savior, he is the redeemer.

296
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,640
 He is the one that can make a way where there is no way.

297
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,800
 And as we were worshiping I just had the sense

298
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,080
 that God wants to raise our faith.

299

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,260
 but at the same time, acknowledge God's,

370
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,740
 you know, his love for us.

371
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,300
 He died on the cross for us.

372
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,580
 And let's just sing this from the bottom of our heart,

373
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,660
 you know, to glorify God.

 love all the connections happening.

494
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,500
 Hey, there are several things

495
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,500
 that I wanna keep you in the loop and keep you updated on.

496
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
 First, as I already mentioned,

497
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
 we have your bring your own lunch.

498
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
 Basically, after the service,

499
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
 either you've brought your lunch,

500
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
 you put it in the fridge,

501
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
 or you go out, grab something, come back,

502
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
 and we're just gonna have lunch together.

503
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
 Now, this is a great way of meeting people here,

504
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,500
 of connecting.

505
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,500
 It's also a good way of catching up

506
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,500
 for those of you who are part of this community.

507
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
 So just encourage you to come.

508
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
 It's always a great time.

509
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
 So bring your own lunch

510
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,500
 just after the service happening then.

511
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,500
 Next, we have, and I'm really excited about this,

512
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,500
 on June 1st, we have our parenting workshop,

513
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,500
 2 to 4 p.m., and the topic is

514
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
 I have big emotions too.

515
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,500
 And basically, it's about,

516
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,500
 the workshop's about identifying your parenting triggers

517
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,500
 and building stronger relationships with your children.

518
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,500
 And our speaker is Dr. Elaine Tang,

519
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
 and she's gonna help us to cultivate

520
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,500
 some self-awareness for effective parenting.

521
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 We're also gonna explore values

522
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
 that we carry ourselves with parenting,

523
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,500
 and emotions, and learn practical strategies

524
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,500
 to enhance our relationship with our children.

525
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,500
 So there's a lot of packed in there.

526
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
 This is gonna be awesome.

527
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,500
 So if you're a parent, or you know someone

528
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
 that could benefit from this,

529
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
 I wanna encourage you to invite them.

530
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
 So we do four of these a year,

531
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
 two in Cantonese, two in English.

532
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,500
 This is the English one.

533
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
 We have our Cantonese one in March.

534
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,500
 We have another one coming up sometime in the near future.

535
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,500
 This is one way that we wanna love, and serve,

536
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,500
 and contribute to the flourishing of our city.

537
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,500
 So this is one intentional and strategic investment

538
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,500
 that we make, that we bring high-quality speakers

539
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
 who run very practical workshops

540
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,500
 so that anyone who comes will be equipped,

541
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,500
 will gain some new tools that they can walk away with

542
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,500
 and their family can flourish.

543
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
 And so if you know anyone,

544
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
 share it in your mom's groups, your dad's groups.

545
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
 I don't know if their dad's usually in enough groups, right?

546
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
 It's usually mom's groups.

547
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
 Share it in your mom's groups.

548
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
 Invite people.

549
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
 And by the way, we've made it free.

550
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,500
 We didn't want any barrier for anyone to come.

551
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
 So if you're single parent, traditional family,

552
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
 doesn't matter, you are welcome to come.

553
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
 But do please sign up and let us know

554
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
 because there will also be some beverages

555
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
 and some little treats and things.

556
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
 So this is gonna be amazing.

557
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,500
 All right, next, we owe you an update.

558
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,500
 Vision Sunday happened in March.

559
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
 So on Vision Sunday, we shared, we wanted to,

560
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,500
 our aim, our goal was to raise 400,000 Hong Kong dollars

561
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
 as a new church plant.

562
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
 And so part of that, of course,

563
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
 is for us to continue to carry out our mission,

564
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,500
 our vision of bringing the gospel to this community.

565
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
 And I just, I'm really excited.

566
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,500
 I wanna share with you how much we raised.

567
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
 Drum roll.

568
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
 Yay!

569
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,500
 705,440 Hong Kong dollars.

570
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
 So praise God.

571
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
 He did more than we could ask for, imagine.

572
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,500
 So thank you for your generosity in that.

573
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
 Now, you might wonder what's next,

574
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
 what's gonna happen with this.

575
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
 So there's just a couple of things

576
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
 that I wanna share on that.

577
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,500
 First, 433,000, I'm not gonna say the whole number,

578
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,500
 will go to operations and ministry expenses and reserve.

579
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
 Now, what does that involve?

580
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
 For one, it just involves us simply being able

581
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
 to gather here on Sundays.

582
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500
 It involves K-alpha, it involves K for C,

583
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,500
 it involves anything that happens in here.

584
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
 And so this just allows us to continue

585
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,500
 to carry that forward and gives us some stability

586
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
 by building a reserve.

587
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
 Since we're a new church, this is significant,

588
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,500
 important for us to have a little bit of reserve

589
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,500
 and operation security.

590
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,500
 Then the second part, 272,000,

591
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
 will go into special outreach and community projects.

592
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
 So you already heard about the parenting workshop.

593
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,500
 That's one of those where we seek to reach out

594
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
 and just bless our neighbors

595
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,500
 and form relationships with them.

596
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,500
 Also, we're in the process of starting a youth group.

597
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,500
 So this will also be used to do special events

598
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,500
 for youth in this community and to connect

599
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
 and to reach them.

600
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
 Then we also are in the process

601
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,500
 of forming relationships with mission partners,

602
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,500
 people who serve here in the community

603
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,500
 in incredible ways and have an impact.

604
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,500
 We want to partner with them.

605
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
 We want to pray for them.

606
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,500
 We want to also support them financially.

607
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
 Because we could try to do the things they are doing,

608
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,500
 but we would at best do a mediocre job.

609
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
 They do an incredible job,

610
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
 so we want to partner with them

611
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,500
 and strategically invest in those partnerships

612
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,500
 where we can contribute to the flourishing

613
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
 of people here in this community.

614
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,500
 So we're in the process with one organization.

615
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
 Once we're through with that,

616
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,500
 and that's signed off and everything,

617
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
 we'll announce that.

618
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,500
 Our aim is to have two of those mission partnerships

619
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
 established by the end of the year.

620
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
 So you can pray that the Holy Spirit also leads us

621
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
 in both of these and just leads us

622
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
 to the right partnerships as well.

623
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
 So I'm excited.

624
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,500
 This really is helping us make a major investment

625
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
 in this community, in this city,

626
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
 to turn lament into joy

627
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
 and for us to continue to work as a church.

628
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
 So praise God.

629
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
 Thank you for your generosity.

630
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,500
 Now, right now we're going to transition

631
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,500
 into a time of our tithes and offerings.

632
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,500
 I want to invite the welcome team to come up.

633
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:26,500
 So we are--part of our worship is our finances,

634
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
 how we steward them.

635
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
 Everything we have is from God.

636
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
 So this is one way of us loving God back

637
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
 with our finances,

638
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,500
 making funds available for him, for his work.

639
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,500
 And so thank you for all your generosity

640
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
 and all your giving always.

641
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
 Here are different ways that you can give.

642
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,500
 There is digital ways, which are popular.

643
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,500
 There's also the buckets going around with envelopes

644
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
 if you prefer that.

645
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
 What's helpful for us as a new church plant is always

646
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,500
 if you set up online automatic giving

647
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
 that helps us with planning

648
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
 and we know what we're working with.

649
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
 So if you consider us your home church,

650
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
 please do pray about that.

651
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,500
 But I would love to pray for the offering

652
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
 and also the Vision Sunday giving

653
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
 and just pray a blessing over that.

654
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
 So let me pray.

655
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,500
 Jesus, we are humbled by how you have been providing

656
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
 for us in this church plant.

657
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,500
 Every step of the way, you have been faithful

658
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,500
 and you have provided what we need when we need it.

659
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
 And we want to give you praise for that.

660
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
 We thank you for all that's been raised by the Vision Sunday,

661
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,500
 for all the people who were able to give.

662
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,500
 And we want to lift up what's given today

663
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
 and what was given then,

664
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,500
 that it may be used for your glory and for your purpose

665
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
 to reach the city, to love the city

666
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,500
 with your good news, the gospel message,

667
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,500
 and also to do works of justice and mercy

668
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
 for the marginalized

669
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,500
 and those who need others to advocate

670
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,500
 and to step up for them as well.

671
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,500
 And so we want to give you all the glory

672
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,500
 and I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Amen.

673
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
 All right. Hey, I'm excited

674
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,500
 because I want to invite a very cool person up.

675
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,500
 Chapman, Pastor Chapman.

676
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
 Come on up. Okay.

677
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,500
 Watch out. Don't trip.

678
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
 Can you hear me here? Okay, come on.

679
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
 Come in here. All right.

680
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500
 So Chapman is one of our pastors

681
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
 and I'm going to pray for him right now.

682
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
 Does that sound good?

683
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,500
 All right. You can stretch out your hands towards him as well.

684
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,500
 Jesus, I thank you for my brother here who loves you.

685
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,500
 I pray that you powerfully speak through him

686
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
 as he proclaims your word,

687
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,500
 that you just anoint him, anoint his tongue,

688
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
 and that you also prepare our hearts to receive

689
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
 what it is that you want to say to us.

690
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,500
 So I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Amen.

691
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,500
 Oh, wow. Your lights are pretty bright.

692
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
 Bright here. I hope you don't mind.

693
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,500
 But yeah, I can take this off as well.

694
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
 Oh, wow.

695
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,500
 This reminds me of the very first day

696
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,500
 that I first saw light in my life.

697
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,500
 Ah, what a wonderful memory.

698
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,500
 Actually, I can't stop telling that story again and again in my life.

699
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
 Oh, but since--yeah, I know.

700
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
 We've never met before, right?

701
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
 This is the first time I meet you.

702
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,500
 So I'm just going to let you know a little bit about myself.

703
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,500
 Hi, everyone. My name is Bar Timaeus.

704
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:36,500
 I'm Jewish, and I'm not going to tell you about my age.

705
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:42,500
 But, you know, in our language, which is Aramaic, by the way,

706
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,500
 Bar, my name Bar, means son.

707
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,500
 And my father's name was Timaeus.

708
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,500
 So my name literally means son of Timaeus.

709
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:58,500
 I guess when he named me, he was expecting me to be like him.

710
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,500
 But then I guess he was really frustrated or disappointed the day

711
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:07,500
 when he found out I was actually blind.

712
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,500
 When I was young, my parents, they loved me.

713
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,500
 They don't normally talk about my condition,

714
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,500
 but they actually taught me how to survive.

715
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,500
 I remember there was one night at home.

716
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,500
 I was supposed to be sleeping, and I heard them crying outside,

717
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,500
 and they were saying something like--they're praying, saying,

718
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,500
 "Forgive our sins, Lord," and I don't know what that means.

719
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,500
 But later I heard somebody said,

720
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,500
 "Actually, blindness and other disabilities is normally a form

721
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
 of punishment from the Lord."

722
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,500
 I remember that night I went home at dinner, and I told my parents,

723
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:51,500
 I said this, I said, "Father, Mother, is the Lord punishing us?

724
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,500
 That's why I'm blind?"

725
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:01,500
 That was the longest silence I've ever experienced.

726
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:06,500
 My father and my mother, they haven't said another word that night,

727
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,500
 and I just decided I'll never bring that up again.

728
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
 Don't get me wrong, my parents, they do love me.

729
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,500
 They took good care of me, but eventually they passed.

730
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,500
 Everybody does, right?

731
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,500
 Someone like me, I wasn't able to do any kind of work,

732
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,500
 because any kind of work, it would mean physical labor,

733
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,500
 like farming or fishing, and I couldn't see,

734
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,500
 and I couldn't do any of that.

735
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
 I had no income.

736
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,500
 So soon after my parents were gone, I ended up on the streets.

737
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,500
 What else can a blind man like me do except begging for money,

738
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,500
 begging for people to spare some change for me?

739
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,500
 So every day when the rooster crows, "Cuckoo, cuckoo,"

740
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,500
 I'll just make my way to the market.

741
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,500
 I'll go outside the market and wait for people to come.

742
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
 And I know what time people come.

743
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,500
 It's normally when I could feel the heat of the sun on my face.

744
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,500
 That's the time when people started coming.

745
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
 And you know what? I'll tell you something.

746
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,500
 If you want to be a beggar outside the market, there's a strategy.

747
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,500
 Yes, being a beggar, you need strategy as well.

748
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,500
 So what I would do is I would go to the entrance of the market,

749
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,500
 but I cannot be too close to the stores,

750
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
 otherwise the store owners would get mad at us,

751
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,500
 and they would drive us away.

752
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,500
 But I can't be too far away either, because if I stay too far away,

753
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,500
 people, after they are leaving the market, they would either miss us,

754
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,500
 or they would have given all their spare change to those beggars

755
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,500
 closer to the market, so it takes strategy.

756
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,500
 And me and my buddies, we are really good at strategies,

757
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,500
 and one day we found out a great strategy.

758
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,500
 Do you know who are the most generous people in all of Judea?

759
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,500
 It's actually those people who are going to the temple

760
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,500
 to present the sacrifice to the Lord.

761
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:11,500
 And so me and my friends, we found a good spot outside the city of Jericho,

762
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,500
 because there were a lot of travelers going or going to

763
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,500
 or coming back from Jerusalem.

764
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,500
 And so we would sit there and just wait for someone to drop by.

765
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:29,500
 And one day, one day there was another large crowd passing by

766
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
 and headed to Jerusalem.

767
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:37,500
 Oh, I thought, you know, it could be some Pharisees, rabbis, and their followers.

768
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,500
 But let me tell you, they are bad business.

769
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,500
 You know, the Pharisees, they are known for their love for money.

770
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,500
 They are very stingy people, but they love to put on a show for everyone.

771
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,500
 So what they would do is, when there's a large audience,

772
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,500
 these Pharisee rabbis, they would come to people like us,

773
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,500
 and they would start talking about, oh, how the law instructs them

774
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,500
 to care for people like us.

775
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,500
 And they would say, "Oh, yes, I love the law. I love the Lord,"

776
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
 and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

777
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,500
 And then in the thunder of applause, everybody was clapping,

778
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:18,500
 and they would throw us a few cents, not even enough for my lunch.

779
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:24,500
 They would even expect us to go to them and say, "Oh, thank you for your generosity, sir.

780
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
 Thank you so much."

781
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,500
 The memory of that makes me sick.

782
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:38,500
 But just out of curiosity that day, just because I do want to find out who it was,

783
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:48,500
 I shouted. I said, "Excuse me, who are you following?"

784
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,500
 Yeah, like that. Nobody responded.

785
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,500
 I think after five times, I have shouted the same thing.

786
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,500
 Finally, perhaps someone was kind enough, or maybe they were too annoyed by me.

787
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:06,500
 They finally yelled back at me and said, "Oh, it's Jesus of Nazareth,

788
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,500
 what do you blind men know about the rabbi?

789
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,500
 Just keep quiet, man. Don't embarrass yourself."

790
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:19,500
 Jesus of Nazareth. Come on, surely I've heard of him.

791
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,500
 Everybody in town have heard of him.

792
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,500
 People talk about him in the market. They talk about him on the streets.

793
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,500
 Of course, they were skeptical at first.

794
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,500
 They would say something like, "Oh, what good can come out of Nazareth?"

795
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,500
 Or they would say, "A Galilean? Are you kidding me?

796
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,500
 Is he here to teach us how to fish?"

797
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,500
 Well, but then I started to hear stories.

798
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,500
 There was a story about him healing a paralyzed man.

799
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:58,500
 I don't know how he did it, but what I heard was that man literally picked up his man and walked away.

800
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:06,500
 And I heard another story about him driving demons out of a man into some pigs.

801
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,500
 That was a hilarious one, right?

802
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:21,500
 But later I heard of a story of Jesus opening the eyes of a blind man in Bethsaida.

803
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:32,500
 I'm like, "Really? Someone like me, a blind man, can be healed?"

804
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,500
 Then I remember I used to follow my parents to the synagogue,

805
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,500
 and I would listen to the reading of scriptures.

806
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:45,500
 It was a brief moment in my life when I would feel I'm normal,

807
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,500
 because everybody else would be doing the same thing.

808
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:54,500
 They would just sit there and listen attentively to the reader or to the preacher, to the speaker.

809
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,500
 I felt I could blend in. I felt that moment.

810
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:02,500
 I'm normal. I could just do what everybody else does.

811
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,500
 That's the one thing that I really enjoy.

812
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,500
 And I remember there was this particular book written by the prophet Isaiah,

813
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:17,500
 and then he talks about this figure, they call him the Messiah, the Son of David.

814
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,500
 He will bring us the kingdom of peace, of shalom.

815
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,500
 And not only that, but there is a line in this book that says,

816
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:32,500
 "The eyes of the blind will be opened, the ears of the deaf will be unstopped,

817
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:40,500
 the lame will leap like a deer, and the mute tongue will shout for joy."

818
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:47,500
 Every time when they read that, I just couldn't stop weeping.

819
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:53,500
 What beautiful words. What a wonderful promise.

820
00:48:53,500 --> 00:49:02,500
 And then I start to wonder, would this Jesus of Nazareth be that anointed one,

821
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
 that promised Messiah?

822
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:14,500
 Could I be a part of his kingdom and experience shalom and feel complete for once in my life?

823
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,500
 When that name was mentioned that day outside the city of Jericho,

824
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,500
 my entire body started shaking.

825
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:29,500
 I knew I had to call him. I knew if someone could help me, that would be him.

826
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,500
 The next moment, I found these words just coming out of my mouth.

827
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:42,500
 "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me, please."

828
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,500
 What else could I ask of a king?

829
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,500
 And he's just not a normal king, he's the king of kings.

830
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:55,500
 What else could I ask him but to have mercy on a nobody like me?

831
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:01,500
 I actually don't know if Jesus has heard me, but those around surely did,

832
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,500
 and they weren't very happy.

833
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,500
 They were saying, "Keep your voice down, man."

834
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:14,500
 They were saying, "It's not time to ask for money. Get lost, you beggar."

835
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:20,500
 Or someone say, "He's a very important man who's got important business in Jerusalem.

836
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:26,500
 He's not here to entertain you. Just go home, you dude."

837
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,500
 Usually when I hear this kind of stuff, I would try to hide.

838
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,500
 I would feel super embarrassed. I would run away.

839
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:39,500
 But in that instance, I knew I'd rather lose face and make a fool of myself

840
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:44,500
 than to lose the one opportunity to get my life changed.

841
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:49,500
 I wanted this so badly that shame couldn't stop me.

842
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,500
 Their mean words and their rebuke couldn't stop me.

843
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:58,500
 I gathered all my strength, and I yelled at the top of my lungs again,

844
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:04,500
 "Son of David, help me! Have mercy on me!"

845
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,500
 And suddenly, I no longer heard footsteps.

846
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:16,500
 The whole crowd quieted down as if they were waiting for something to happen.

847
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:23,500
 And I heard a man's voice, "Cheer up, mate! On your feet! He's calling you!"

848
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,500
 I could tell that voice, even though I couldn't see,

849
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:32,500
 I could tell that voice was directed to my direction, but I couldn't believe.

850
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,500
 So I had to confirm. I said, "Me?"

851
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:40,500
 He said, "Yeah, you blind man. He wants to talk to you."

852
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:49,500
 "You mean the Messiah didn't just hear me, but he actually stopped to see me?"

853
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:56,500
 "I've never had someone who want to spend time with me ever since my parents were gone."

854
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:06,500
 "Everybody here, they tried to stop me, but Jesus, he stopped for me."

855
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:14,500
 "These people, they made me feel like I'm a nobody, but that day, Jesus made me feel I'm a somebody."

856
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:22,500
 I was so overwhelmed, but I jumped to my feet at once, and I walked towards that voice,

857
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,500
 and I could sense the crowd just parted like the Red Sea in front of me

858
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:33,500
 until I reached the other shore where Jesus was waiting for me.

859
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:41,500
 I will never forget his first words to me, and in fact, he asked me a question.

860
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:48,500
 He said, "What do you want me to do for you?"

861
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,500
 "What do you mean, what do I want?"

862
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,500
 "No one has ever asked me such a question."

863
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,500
 "Who would care what a blind beggar wants?"

864
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:04,500
 "And if Jesus is king, I should be the one doing what he wants."

865
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,500
 "I should be the one bowing before him and said, 'Your will be done, my Lord.'"

866
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,500
 "I should be the one asking him that."

867
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:19,500
 And yet, he's asking me what I want.

868
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:30,500
 Here, standing in front of me was a man who was king, and yet he acted like a servant.

869
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:37,500
 With tears in my eyes, I uttered my wildest dream to him.

870
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:47,500
 I said, "My master, my Lord, I want to see."

871
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:53,500
 I never dared to say those four words, "I want to see" to anyone in my life.

872
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:58,500
 People would just call me silly, or they would say, "It's impossible."

873
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:03,500
 "It's unrealistic." "Stop daydreaming."

874
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,500
 I never imagined someone would care to listen.

875
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:13,500
 Just now I told you, when I used to listen to God's word in the synagogue,

876
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,500
 I felt I'm normal. But you know what?

877
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:25,500
 That day, I suddenly realized I felt I was a normal person

878
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,500
 when someone actually stopped to listen to me.

879
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:35,500
 And what really blew my mind was that that someone, standing there,

880
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:45,500
 asking what I wanted, listening to my every word, he was God himself.

881
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:51,500
 "Go," he said. "Your faith has healed you."

882
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:58,500
 Before he finished that sentence, I felt this warmth, this burning sensation in my eyes,

883
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,500
 and then it was brightness.

884
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:07,500
 It's like walking out of a completely dark room into the bright, sunny day.

885
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,500
 My faith in Jesus opened my eyes.

886
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:19,500
 And when I looked up, I saw a face. I saw the face.

887
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,500
 I remember in the synagogue, they used to pray this blessing over us.

888
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:29,500
 "The Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you."

889
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,500
 "The Lord turns his face towards you and give you peace."

890
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,500
 That's the face I saw that day.

891
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:43,500
 That's the very first face, indeed, in my life I've ever seen.

892
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:53,500
 And that's the face I'm going to see in eternity, the face of Jesus.

893
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:58,500
 At that moment, I knew I wanted to follow him for the rest of my life.

894
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,500
 I knew I'll go wherever he goes.

895
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,500
 He's my healer. He's my savior. He's my king.

896
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:12,500
 I want to spend the rest of my life asking him, "What do you want me to do for you?"

897
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:19,500
 Or even better, "What do you want me to do with you, Lord?"

898
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,500
 I was a blind beggar sitting on the side of the road.

899
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:31,500
 But Jesus came. He stopped. He listened. And he responded.

900
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:38,500
 So I'm telling you guys, today, if you cry out to him, he would do the same for you.

901
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,500
 He would come into your life. He would stop for you.

902
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:46,500
 He would listen to you, and he would respond.

903
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,500
 What is that you want to tell him today?

904
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:56,500
 Where in your life you need him to heal you and save you, to zozo you?

905
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:05,500
 Come to him today and cry out to him, "Jesus, have mercy on me."

906
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:23,500
 [silence]

907
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,500
 Greetings, my dear friends. Peace be with you.

908
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,500
 [applause]

909
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,500
 Oh, thank you for that.

910
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,500
 How are you guys doing today?

911
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:40,500
 My name is John. I'm one of the disciples of Jesus.

912
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,500
 Isn't the story of Bartimaeus amazing? Can you give him a round of applause?

913
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,500
 [applause]

914
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:53,500
 But I want to tell you this. What's even more wonderful for me personally

915
00:57:53,500 --> 00:58:00,500
 is that the day when Bartimaeus received his sight, I received mine too.

916
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:05,500
 The day when his eyes were open, so were mine.

917
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:10,500
 I remember that day very well. It was the final days we spent with Jesus

918
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:15,500
 before he was arrested, he was tortured, and finally crucified in Jerusalem.

919
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,500
 In fact, we were on our way there. We were walking towards Jerusalem,

920
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:24,500
 and we came all the way from Galilee, and then we passed through Jericho in Judea,

921
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,500
 and we were headed towards Jerusalem.

922
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:33,500
 And that was the Passover period, so there were lots of people going to Jerusalem

923
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,500
 alongside us, and we had a large crowd following us.

924
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,500
 And you know Jesus, just being Jesus himself, he would seize every opportunity

925
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,500
 to teach the people about the kingdom of God.

926
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:51,500
 But I could tell, being his friend, he was quite burdened inside.

927
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,500
 It's in the small details. It's in the way how he looked at us.

928
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,500
 It's in the way how he would spend longer time away from us in solitude,

929
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,500
 like just praying by himself.

930
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:08,500
 And he also told us, not just once, not just twice, but three times,

931
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:14,500
 that whatever is in store for him in Jerusalem, it's pain and suffering and death.

932
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,500
 He said he's going to be killed there.

933
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,500
 You know, of course, none of us wanted that to happen, right?

934
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,500
 He's a good friend. He's a rabbi.

935
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:27,500
 My best buddy, Peter, actually tried to talk him out of it,

936
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,500
 but yeah, it didn't end too well for him.

937
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:36,500
 But even what's more bizarre was that he told us after he died,

938
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,500
 he would rise again in three days.

939
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,500
 We had no idea what he was talking about.

940
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,500
 But so far, let me tell you, following Jesus, yeah,

941
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:52,500
 that kind of life is nothing short of miracles, surprises,

942
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,500
 and also riddles that none of us really understood.

943
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:02,500
 The one thing we were sure, though, was that he was the Son of God,

944
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,500
 and he is the Son of God.

945
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,500
 He's the Messiah that we've been waiting for.

946
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:13,500
 We even saw him talking to Moses and Elijah on the top of a mountain.

947
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:20,500
 He is going to be a Messiah, and what that means is he should be a conquering king.

948
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,500
 He will lead us in glorious victories and establish his kingdom

949
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,500
 over those Romans and other Gentiles.

950
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:33,500
 At least that was what I was told and what I had believed ever since I was a boy.

951
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,500
 So that day, yeah, back to the story.

952
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:40,500
 That day, we were passing by Jericho, and everybody cheered for us

953
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,500
 like what you did just now.

954
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:48,500
 The whole town gathered literally on the two sides of the road just to see Jesus.

955
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:53,500
 After all the miracles and all the healings, you wouldn't be surprised

956
01:00:53,500 --> 01:01:00,500
 if Jesus is the most popular, famous Jewish man on the planet, right?

957
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500
 Everybody wants a piece of him.

958
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,500
 So sometimes I feel a little bit overwhelmed and, "Oh, that's too much."

959
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:10,500
 And you know, me and my brother James, we volunteered to be Jesus' bodyguards,

960
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,500
 like, "Hey, stop, stop there. We're his security detail."

961
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,500
 And we would exercise a little bit of crowd control.

962
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,500
 Okay, just let me tell you a fun fact.

963
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,500
 Me and my brother James, we have a nickname.

964
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,500
 We're called the Sons of Thunder because of our temper, I guess.

965
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,500
 Anyway, but suddenly that day when we were getting out of Jericho,

966
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,500
 we heard a voice, a very loud voice that says, "Jesus, Son of David,

967
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,500
 have mercy on me."

968
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:43,500
 "Oh, Son of David. Huh, this guy knew what he was talking about, huh?"

969
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:47,500
 It seems we're not the only one who believe Jesus is the Messiah

970
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,500
 because that's what that phrase, "Son of David," means.

971
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:55,500
 So I tried to look around, but I don't see who's talking.

972
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,500
 And perhaps there was just too many people.

973
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,500
 So then someone from the crowd just told me, "Oh, it's just a beggar.

974
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,500
 He was probably asking for money."

975
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,500
 I'm like, "Okay, if he thinks Jesus is a rich Messiah,

976
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,500
 then he must be misguided."

977
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,500
 "Well, look at us. Look at me. Do I look rich to you guys?"

978
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,500
 "I'm not rich. Jesus is not rich."

979
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,500
 "But all right, anyway, just a beggar, just looking for money.

980
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,500
 False alarm. Let's move on. Let's carry on.

981
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,500
 We got to go find a place to rest before sunset, you know?

982
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,500
 It's really dangerous out here in the wilderness in Judea."

983
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,500
 But just as I was taking a few more steps down the road,

984
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,500
 that same voice yelled again, "Son of David,

985
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,500
 have mercy on me!"

986
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:42,500
 And I thought, "Okay, I'm the bodyguard. I should deal with that."

987
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:48,500
 But before I walked to deal with him, Jesus, he stopped.

988
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,500
 I'm like, "Oh, come on.

989
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,500
 If someone has any spare food for this guy,

990
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,500
 let's just give it to him so we can all be on our way.

991
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,500
 Come on, come on. I don't have time."

992
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,500
 You know, "Now a glorious journey to Jerusalem.

993
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,500
 It's going to be delayed.

994
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,500
 Who knows what's going to happen in Jerusalem?

995
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,500
 Jesus may actually become king there, you know,

996
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,500
 and we would have a royal status.

997
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,500
 He's messing with our schedule right now.

998
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,500
 Could somebody just take care of him?"

999
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,500
 You see, when would the procession of a king

1000
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,500
 be interrupted by some homeless man, right?

1001
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,500
 So he just want to go.

1002
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,500
 And Jesus says, "Call him."

1003
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:38,500
 You know his voice is always so gentle, yet full of authority.

1004
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,500
 And so we did. We called that guy over.

1005
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:46,500
 And a few moments later, we met the guy with the loud voice,

1006
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,500
 and on top of that, he also had long and dirty hair.

1007
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,500
 He had worn out clothes and some very unpleasant smell.

1008
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:57,500
 Oh, that guy was blind.

1009
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,500
 So Jesus looked at him and said,

1010
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,500
 "What do you want me to do for you?"

1011
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,500
 "Wait, what did he just say?"

1012
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,500
 I immediately turned and looked at my brother James,

1013
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,500
 and he did the same. He just looked at me.

1014
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,500
 Because the day before,

1015
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,500
 Jesus asked the two of us the exact same question.

1016
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,500
 See, we were on the journey to Jerusalem,

1017
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,500
 and we knew something big, something important was going to happen.

1018
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,500
 So of course, Jesus mentioned he was going to suffer and die,

1019
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,500
 and all that we know.

1020
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,500
 But James and I, we decided to go and talk to Jesus.

1021
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,500
 And we said, "You know, we've been following you for so long,

1022
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,500
 and since the beginning, we were your first disciples.

1023
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,500
 Surely we deserve a front seat in the kingdom of God, right?"

1024
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,500
 Can I get an amen for that?

1025
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,500
 No, none of you agree with me. That's okay.

1026
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:53,500
 And so we asked Jesus, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask."

1027
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,500
 And Jesus asked the same question,

1028
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,500
 "What do you want me to do for you?"

1029
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:03,500
 Well, we shamelessly asked to sit at his right and his left.

1030
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:07,500
 Yeah, we want the fame. We want the power, right?

1031
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,500
 Come on. We have laid down literally everything to follow Jesus

1032
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,500
 in the last three years.

1033
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,500
 We were by his side the whole time,

1034
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,500
 and that's what we deserve.

1035
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,500
 That's what we are entitled to, right?

1036
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,500
 But look at this blind beggar.

1037
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,500
 What did he do to deserve this?

1038
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,500
 What has he done to earn this favor

1039
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:33,500
 that the Messiah himself would do something for him?

1040
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,500
 He hasn't followed Jesus for a single day.

1041
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,500
 He never preached the good news of the kingdom like we did.

1042
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:43,500
 He never healed a sick person or drive out a demon like we have.

1043
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,500
 Why would he deserve this?

1044
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,500
 And I heard he said, "My master, my Lord,

1045
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,500
 I want to see."

1046
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,500
 And yet, there he goes once again.

1047
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,500
 As always, the miracle happened.

1048
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:03,500
 And Bartimaeus, he immediately joined the company

1049
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,500
 and followed Jesus.

1050
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,500
 He became part of us.

1051
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,500
 He became a brother.

1052
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,500
 And then I realized,

1053
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:18,500
 Jesus didn't stop to perform a miracle.

1054
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:23,500
 Jesus actually was there to call a man.

1055
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:27,500
 Just like the day when he called me and my brother James and Peter,

1056
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,500
 he stopped and performed a miracle for us

1057
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,500
 and called us to follow him.

1058
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,500
 Whatever Jesus saw in me,

1059
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:41,500
 he saw in Bartimaeus too.

1060
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:46,500
 Who am I to think that I deserve and he doesn't?

1061
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,500
 Isn't it only because of Jesus' grace

1062
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:54,500
 that we are both saved and restored?

1063
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:59,500
 That day, outside the city of Jericho,

1064
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,500
 when Jesus opened the eyes of Bartimaeus,

1065
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,500
 he opened mine too.

1066
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,500
 While Bartimaeus, he could be physically blind,

1067
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:14,500
 I, myself, and many other disciples,

1068
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,500
 we were indeed spiritually blind.

1069
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,500
 We were blind to who Jesus was

1070
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,500
 and his real mission here on earth.

1071
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,500
 We were so obsessed with the image of a conquering king

1072
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,500
 that we were blind to the suffering servant

1073
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,500
 right in front of our eyes.

1074
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,500
 We were so obsessed with the success and achievements

1075
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,500
 we want Jesus to give us

1076
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,500
 that we were blind to his call,

1077
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,500
 which is to follow his examples

1078
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,500
 and serve those around us.

1079
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,500
 Our role as his disciples should be,

1080
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,500
 supposed to be, to bring people to him,

1081
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,500
 not to stop them from coming to him.

1082
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,500
 And we've been doing such a poor job.

1083
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:01,500
 And no wonder we're also blind to the poor,

1084
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,500
 to the vulnerable, to the marginalized,

1085
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,500
 to the needies around us.

1086
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,500
 In our spiritual blindness,

1087
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:13,500
 we only focus on what we can gain in this life

1088
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,500
 and we forgot what we could give.

1089
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,500
 We ignore the marginalized.

1090
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,500
 We say that their problem is not our problem.

1091
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,500
 What's even worse,

1092
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,500
 when they try to voice out their problems,

1093
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,500
 we silence them.

1094
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,500
 We tell them this is not the place and time

1095
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,500
 to say these things.

1096
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,500
 Let's do it later.

1097
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,500
 Let's don't do it here.

1098
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,500
 We don't have time for you.

1099
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,500
 But Jesus, Jesus doesn't stop people

1100
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,500
 from expressing their needs.

1101
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,500
 Instead, he stops for them.

1102
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,500
 He sees them.

1103
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,500
 He listens.

1104
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,500
 He responds.

1105
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,500
 Jesus doesn't just want to heal the physically blind.

1106
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,500
 He also wants to open the eyes

1107
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:59,500
 of the spiritually blind as well.

1108
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,500
 What kind of a church are we?

1109
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,500
 Are we a spiritually blind church?

1110
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,500
 Are we a spiritually blind disciple?

1111
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,500
 That we are blind to the needs of those around us?

1112
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,500
 That we just turn a blind eye

1113
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,500
 or we look away?

1114
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,500
 Or are we blind to who Jesus really is

1115
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:22,500
 and what he wants to achieve in this earth?

1116
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,500
 Are we spiritually blind

1117
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:33,500
 that we actually can't see Jesus' heart for the others?

1118
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,500
 That day Jesus opened my eyes.

1119
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,500
 I once was lost, but now I'm found.

1120
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:44,500
 I was blind, but now I see.

1121
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,500
 I know what kind of a disciple

1122
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,500
 I want to be since that day.

1123
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,500
 I want to be the kind of disciple of Jesus

1124
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,500
 that would stop for people,

1125
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,500
 that would see people as people,

1126
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,500
 that would listen to them,

1127
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,500
 that would respond to their need.

1128
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:04,500
 And what about you, my friends?

1129
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:10,500
 What kind of a Jesus follower would you want to be?

1130
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,500
 I wonder where you find yourself

1131
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,500
 outside the city of Jericho today.

1132
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,500
 Are you the one sitting at the side of the road

1133
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,500
 like Bartimaeus

1134
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,500
 and you're carrying with you a physical condition perhaps

1135
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,500
 or maybe an emotional or even a relational issue

1136
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:30,500
 and you need to cry out for Jesus' help?

1137
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,500
 Or perhaps you're one of those standing in the crowd

1138
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,500
 like the disciples,

1139
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,500
 suffering from spiritual blindness.

1140
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,500
 You're either blind to Jesus,

1141
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,500
 his identity and his mission on earth

1142
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,500
 or maybe you're blind to the needs around you.

1143
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,500
 You know, if you're blind to the needs

1144
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,500
 of the people around you,

1145
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:52,500
 that affects not just how you would interact with them,

1146
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,500
 that affects how God would interact with them

1147
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,500
 through you as well.

1148
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,500
 So no matter where you are today,

1149
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,500
 Jesus is here

1150
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,500
 and he wants to heal you and save you,

1151
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,500
 to zozo you.

1152
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,500
 All you need is to say,

1153
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,500
 "Have mercy on me, Lord."

1154
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,500
 And I'm just wondering right across this room right now,

1155
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,500
 who would love to pray this prayer with me?

1156
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,500
 I myself, I definitely need to pray this prayer.

1157
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,500
 "Lord, have mercy on me, open my eyes."

1158
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,500
 I wonder who wants to join me in this prayer.

1159
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,500
 If that's you, I invite you to stand where you are

1160
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,500
 and close your eyes.

1161
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,500
 You know, sometimes it doesn't really matter

1162
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,500
 what we're seeing physically.

1163
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,500
 It matters even more what we can see spiritually.

1164
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,500
 And Jesus, he's so kind,

1165
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,500
 he's so faithful, he's so loving.

1166
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,500
 He wants to open your eyes

1167
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,500
 and my eyes here today.

1168
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,500
 So church,

1169
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,500
 I can't do this on your behalf.

1170
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,500
 You must come to him.

1171
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,500
 I can only show you the way to Jesus

1172
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,500
 and you have to be the one to cry out to him.

1173
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,500
 "Have mercy on me, Lord."

1174
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,500
 Why don't we do it now?

1175
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:21,500
 (silence)

1176
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:25,500
 Jesus, you didn't just heal Bartimaeus that day.

1177
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:30,500
 You didn't just open his physically blind eyes.

1178
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,500
 You healed your disciples.

1179
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,500
 You healed their spiritual blindness.

1180
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,500
 And God, today I pray that you would come into this place

1181
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,500
 and do the same.

1182
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,500
 Whether it's a physical condition that needs to be zozoed,

1183
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:45,500
 maybe an emotional one, a relational one, a mental one.

1184
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,500
 Jesus, I pray you would so kindly come and zozo us.

1185
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,500
 But I also ask you would come

1186
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,500
 and open our eyes,

1187
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:59,500
 especially those of us who are spiritually blind like myself.

1188
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,500
 That we will turn a blind eye

1189
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,500
 to the people around us.

1190
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:08,500
 Here in Yuen Long, here in Hong Kong,

1191
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:12,500
 or maybe just right next door, our neighbors,

1192
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:17,500
 the person sitting next to us in the office,

1193
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:21,500
 or when we are on the streets, those who need you.

1194
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:27,500
 Father, I pray that we would not just write them off casually

1195
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,500
 and we wouldn't just walk past them

1196
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,500
 without even looking at them.

1197
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,500
 Not in a strange way, but...

1198
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:38,500
 Father, I pray you would give us your vision,

1199
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,500
 your perspective,

1200
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,500
 when we are walking the streets of Hong Kong,

1201
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,500
 the streets of Yuen Long.

1202
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:47,500
 We would actually be able to see the need,

1203
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,500
 or even to listen to them,

1204
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,500
 and respond to them.

1205
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,500
 Come Holy Spirit, help us.

1206
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:02,500
 [music]

1207
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:09,500
 All these pieces broken and scattered

1208
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:16,500
 In mercy gathered, mended and whole

1209
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:23,500
 Empty handed, but not forsaken

1210
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:31,500
 I've been set free, I've been set free

1211
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:39,500
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound

1212
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:44,500
 That saved a wretch like me

1213
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:53,500
 I once was lost, but now I am found

1214
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:58,500
 Was blind, but now I see

1215
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:07,500
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound

1216
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:12,500
 That saved a wretch like me

1217
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:21,500
 I once was lost, but now I am found

1218
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:26,500
 Was blind, but now I see

1219
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:33,500
 I can see you now

1220
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:40,500
 I can see the love in your eyes

1221
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:47,500
 Laying yourself down

1222
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:53,500
 Raising up the broken to life

1223
01:15:53,500 --> 01:16:00,500
 I can see, oh I can see you now

1224
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:07,500
 I can see the love in your eyes

1225
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:14,500
 Laying yourself down

1226
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:22,500
 Raising up the broken to life

1227
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:45,500
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1228
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:51,500
 Amazing grace, amazing grace

1229
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,500
 How sweet the sound

1230
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:58,500
 That saved a wretch like me

1231
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:07,500
 I once was lost, but now I am found

1232
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,500
 Was blind, but now I see

1233
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:17,500
 Amazing grace, amazing grace

1234
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:21,500
 How sweet the sound

1235
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:26,500
 That saved a wretch like me

1236
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:34,500
 I once was lost, but now I am found

1237
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,500
 Was blind, but now I see

1238
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:45,500
 Oh, I can see, I can see you now

1239
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:52,500
 Oh, I can see the love in your eyes

1240
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:58,500
 Laying yourself down

1241
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:04,500
 Raising up the broken to life

1242
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:12,500
 I can see, I can see you now

1243
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:18,500
 I can see the love in your eyes

1244
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:25,500
 Laying yourself down

1245
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:34,500
 Raising up the broken to life

1246
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:39,500
 You know, as we were worshipping, I was just literally picturing

1247
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:43,500
 our blindness, you know, falling from our face,

1248
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:49,500
 our spiritual blindness just, you know, going away.

1249
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:54,500
 And I just wonder, what kind of church would we be

1250
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:59,500
 if we would shake off our spiritual blindness?

1251
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:04,500
 How would people see this gaze of Jesus' love through us

1252
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:08,500
 in the city, around here?

1253
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,500
 You know, I just wonder.

1254
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,500
 Now, I don't know about you, but I long for that.

1255
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,500
 I want that, and I know I have blind spots myself.

1256
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:21,500
 So I want to just pray into that and pray that over us

1257
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:26,500
 that we can be a church that shakes its blindness

1258
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:32,500
 and that can see so that others can see and know Jesus.

1259
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:39,500
 So Jesus, we pray that you would free us

1260
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,500
 from our spiritual blindness, where we get caught up

1261
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,500
 with things like John was caught up with.

1262
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,500
 I want this position, I want to sit here,

1263
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:51,500
 I want things to be this way, I want to be comfortable.

1264
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:58,500
 That you disrupt us and that you show us

1265
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,500
 how you want us to look at things,

1266
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:04,500
 how you want us to look and listen to the people around us.

1267
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,500
 That you, us as a church, that you give us words,

1268
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,500
 that you give us love, that you give us sacrifice,

1269
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:13,500
 that we bring as we pour out your love over the city,

1270
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,500
 as we pour out the love of the people,

1271
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,500
 that you set us free from the spiritual blindness

1272
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,500
 that puts us on a different mission,

1273
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,500
 which is not your mission.

1274
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,500
 Jesus, put us on your mission.

1275
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,500
 Lord, where we've gone wrong, we say,

1276
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,500
 "Jesus, I'm sorry.

1277
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,500
 Forgive me where I've gone wrong.

1278
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:34,500
 Lead me in repentance.

1279
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,500
 Lead me in your love."

1280
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,500
 So we thank you for this work that you've done

1281
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:43,500
 right now in this room, and we pray that by your grace,

1282
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,500
 not out of our own strength, but by your grace,

1283
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,500
 that we live this out more and more as a church community.

1284
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,500
 We pray this in your name, Jesus.

1285
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:56,500
 Amen. Amen.

1286
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:02,500
 Wow, what a gifted and talented actor, preacher we have.

1287
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,500
 So let's give Chapman a hand.

1288
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,500
 Thank you so much.

1289
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:10,500
 You know, it takes boldness to try that.

1290
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,500
 It's not easy to try something in front of people

1291
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,500
 like a different way of preaching.

1292
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,500
 But it really--I don't know about you,

1293
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,500
 but it really helped me to enter into the story

1294
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,500
 in a different way and to see a lot more

1295
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,500
 than I've seen before.

1296
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:29,500
 So thank you, Chapman, for giving it a go.

1297
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,500
 Also, I just want to say thank you for everyone

1298
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,500
 who serves here.

1299
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,500
 We already had earlier that--

1300
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,500
 and as we were giving Thanksgiving, but it's true.

1301
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,500
 You know, we have so many people in so many different ways

1302
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,500
 on different days who serve and who make this happen.

1303
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:44,500
 Thank you for partnering with us.

1304
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,500
 Thank you for just leading us so beautifully

1305
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,500
 in worship today.

1306
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,500
 Thank you all for coming, for being part of this community.

1307
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,500
 We love you all.

1308
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:56,500
 We hope to see you at the Bring Your Own Lunch.

1309
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,500
 That's happening now, but if not next week.

1310
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:02,500
 Also, if you would like prayer, we have a prayer team here.

1311
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,500
 They would love to pray for anything, honestly,

1312
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,500
 that you need prayer for.

1313
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,500
 It doesn't matter what it is.

1314
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,500
 They would love to pray with you, love to bless you.

1315
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,500
 So please do take advantage of that.

1316
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,500
 All right, love you all.

1317
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,500
 Have an amazing Sunday.

1318
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,500
 See you at Bring Your Own Lunch.

1319
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,500
 Okay, bye-bye.
