1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
 Amen

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,400
 Oh, oh wow, your lights are pretty bright, bright here

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,720
 I hope you don't mind, but yeah, I can take this off as well

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,600
 Oh wow

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:20,560
 This reminds me of the very first day that I first saw light in my life

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,960
 Ah, what a wonderful memory

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,360
 Actually, I can't stop telling that story again and again in my life

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,160
 Oh, oh, but since, yeah, I know, we've never met before, right?

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,080
 This is the first time I meet you also

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,160
 I'm just gonna let you know a little bit about myself

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,360
 Hi everyone, my name is Bar Timaeus

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,160
 I'm Jewish and I'm not gonna tell you about my age

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,440
 But, you know, in our language, which is Aramaic, by the way

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,440
 Bar, my name Bar, means son

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,360
 And my father's name was Timaeus

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,840
 So my name literally means son of Timaeus

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,240
 I guess when he named me, he was expecting me to be like him

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,640
 But then I guess he was really frustrated or disappointed the day

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,800
 when he found out I was actually blind

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,520
 When I was young, my parents, they loved me

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,640
 They, you know, they don't normally talk about my condition

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,600
 But they actually taught me how to survive

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,280
 I remember there was one night at home

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,920
 I was supposed to be sleeping and I heard them crying outside

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,480
 And they were saying something like

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,520
 They're praying, saying, "Forgive our sins, Lord"

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,440
 And I don't know what that means

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:48,560
 But later I heard somebody said, "Actually, blindness and other disabilities

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,760
 is normally a form of punishment from the Lord"

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,200
 I remember that night I went home at dinner

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,840
 I told my parents, I said this

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,200
 I said, "Father, Mother, is the Lord punishing us?

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,840
 That's why I'm blind?"

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,680
 That was the longest silence I've ever experienced

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,640
 My father and my mother, they haven't said another word that night

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,320
 And I just decided I'll never bring that up again

37
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,960
 Don't get me wrong, my parents, they do love me

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,240
 They took good care of me

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,040
 But eventually they passed

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,600
 Everybody does, right?

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,800
 And someone like me, I wasn't able to do any kind of work

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,720
 Because any kind of work, it would mean physical labour

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,000
 Like farming or fishing

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,360
 And I couldn't see and I couldn't do any of that

45
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
 I had no income

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,960
 So soon after my parents were gone, I ended up on the streets

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,560
 What else can a blind man like me do

48
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,200
 except begging for money, begging for people to spare some change for me?

49
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,400
 So every day when the rooster crows

50
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,600
 "Cuckoo, cuckoo!"

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,720
 I'll just make my way to the market

52
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,360
 I'll go outside the market and wait for people to come

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,440
 And I know what time people come

54
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,720
 It's normally when I could feel the heat of the sun on my face

55
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,960
 That's the time when people started coming

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
 And you know what? I'll tell you something

57
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
 If you want to be a beggar outside the market, there's a strategy

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,560
 Yes, being a beggar, you need strategy as well

59
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
 So what I would do is I would go to the entrance of the market

60
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,320
 But I cannot be too close to the stores

61
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,480
 Otherwise the store owners would get mad at us and they would drive us away

62
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,160
 But I can't be too far away either

63
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,520
 Because if I stay too far away, people, after they are leaving the market

64
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,880
 they would either miss us or they would have given all their spare change

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
 to those beggars closer to the market

66
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,960
 So it takes strategy

67
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,840
 And me and my buddies, we are really good at strategies

68
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,480
 And one day, we found out a great strategy

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,240
 Do you know who are the most generous people in all of Judea?

70
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,480
 It's actually those people who are going to the temple

71
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,280
 to present the sacrifice to the Lord

72
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,680
 And so, me and my friends, we found a good spot outside the city of Jericho

73
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,320
 because there were a lot of travelers going or going to or coming back from Jerusalem

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,120
 And so we would sit there and just wait for someone to drop by

75
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:41,560
 And one day, one day there was another large crowd passing by and headed to Jerusalem

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,520
 Oh, I thought, you know, it could be some Pharisees, rabbis and their followers

77
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,640
 But let me tell you, they are bad business

78
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,800
 You know, the Pharisees, they are known for their love for money

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,400
 They are very stingy people

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,520
 But they love to put on a show for everyone

81
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,440
 So what they would do is, when there's a large audience, these Pharisee rabbis

82
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,480
 they would come to people like us

83
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,200
 and they would start talking about how the law instructs them to care for people like us

84
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,440
 And they would say, "Oh yes, I love the law, I love the Lord" and blah, blah, blah, blah

85
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,680
 And then, in the thunder of applause, everybody was clapping and they would throw us a few cents

86
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,240
 Not even enough for my lunch

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,520
 And they even expect us to go to them and say, "Oh, thank you for your generosity, sir

88
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,400
 Thank you so much"

89
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,920
 The memory of that makes me sick

90
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:48,120
 But just out of curiosity that day, just because I do want to find out who it was

91
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:55,440
 So I shouted, I said, "Excuse me, who are you following?"

92
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,160
 Yeah, like that, nobody responded

93
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,080
 I think after five times I have shouted the same thing

94
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,600
 Finally, perhaps someone was kind enough, or maybe they were too annoyed by me

95
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,240
 They finally yelled back at me and said, "Oh, it's Jesus of Nazareth

96
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,480
 But what do you blind men know about the rabbi?

97
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,080
 Just keep quiet, man, don't embarrass yourself"

98
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,160
 Jesus of Nazareth

99
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,640
 Come on, surely I've heard of him

100
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,760
 Everybody in town have heard of him

101
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,840
 People talk about him in the market

102
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,320
 They talk about him on the streets

103
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,280
 Of course, they were sceptical at first

104
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,440
 They would say something like, "Oh, what good can come out of Nazareth?"

105
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,720
 Or they would say, "A Galilean? Are you kidding me?

106
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,080
 Is he here to teach us how to fish?"

107
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,920
 Well, but then I started to hear stories

108
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,520
 There was a story about him healing a paralyzed man

109
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:09,080
 I don't know how he did it, but what I heard was that man literally picked up his man and walked away

110
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,920
 And I heard another story about him driving demons out of a man into some pigs

111
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,960
 That was a hilarious one, right?

112
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:31,680
 But later I heard of a story of Jesus opening the eyes of a blind man in Bethsaida

113
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:42,520
 I'm like, "Really? Someone like me, a blind man, can be healed?"

114
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,720
 Then I remember I used to follow my parents to the synagogue

115
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,520
 And I would listen to the reading of scriptures

116
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,040
 It was a brief moment in my life when I would feel I'm normal

117
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,920
 Because everybody else would be doing the same thing

118
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:05,040
 They would just sit there and listen attentively to the reader or to the preacher, to the speaker

119
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,200
 I felt I could blend in, I felt that moment

120
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,640
 I'm normal, I could just do what everybody else does

121
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,280
 That's the one thing that I really enjoy

122
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,280
 And I remember there was this particular book written by the prophet Isaiah

123
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,600
 And then he talks about this figure, they call him the Messiah, the son of David

124
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,280
 He will bring us the kingdom of peace, of shalom

125
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,000
 And not only that, but there is a line in this book that says

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,360
 The eyes of the blind will be opened, the ears of the deaf will be unstopped

127
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,560
 The lame will leap like a deer and the mute tongue will shout for joy

128
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:56,600
 Every time when they read that, I just couldn't stop weeping

129
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,040
 What beautiful words, what a wonderful promise

130
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:12,480
 And then I start to wonder, would this Jesus of Nazareth be that anointed one

131
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,960
 That promised Messiah, could I be a part of his kingdom

132
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,800
 And experience shalom and feel complete for once in my life

133
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,360
 When that name was mentioned that day outside the city of Jericho

134
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,400
 My entire body started shaking

135
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,120
 I knew I had to call him, I knew if someone could help me, that would be him

136
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,880
 The next moment I found these words just coming out of my mouth

137
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,280
 Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me please

138
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,520
 What else could I ask of a king?

139
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,320
 And he's just not a normal king, he's the king of kings

140
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,800
 What else could I ask him but to have mercy on a nobody like me

141
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,600
 I actually don't know if Jesus has heard me

142
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,320
 But those around surely did and they weren't very happy

143
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,960
 They were saying, keep your voice down man

144
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:25,080
 They were saying, it's not time to ask for money, get lost you beggar

145
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,960
 Or someone say, he's a very important man who's got important business in Jerusalem

146
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,760
 He's not here to entertain you, just go home you dude

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,400
 Usually when I hear this kind of stuff I would try to hide, I would feel super embarrassed

148
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:50,120
 I would run away, but in that instance I knew I'd rather lose face and make a fool of myself

149
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,080
 Than to lose the one opportunity to get my life changed

150
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,720
 I wanted this so badly that shame couldn't stop me

151
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,960
 Their mean words and their rebuke couldn't stop me

152
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,360
 I gathered all my strength and I yelled at the top of my lungs again

153
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,160
 Son of David, help me, have mercy on me

154
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,880
 And suddenly I no longer heard footsteps

155
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:26,840
 The whole crowd quieted down as if they were waiting for something to happen

156
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,800
 And I heard a man's voice, cheer up mate, on your feet, he's calling you

157
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,560
 I could tell that voice, even though I couldn't see, I could tell that voice was directed to my direction

158
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,520
 But I couldn't believe, so I had to confirm, I said, me?

159
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,320
 He said, yeah, you blind man, he wants to talk to you

160
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:59,680
 You mean the Messiah didn't just hear me, but he actually stopped to see me?

161
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,720
 I've never had someone who want to spend time with me ever since my parents were gone

162
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:16,800
 Everybody here, they tried to stop me, but Jesus, he stopped for me

163
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:25,160
 These people, they made me feel like I'm a nobody, but that day Jesus made me feel I'm a somebody

164
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:32,840
 I was so overwhelmed, but I jumped to my feet at once and I walked towards that voice

165
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,880
 And I could sense the crowd just parted like the Red Sea in front of me

166
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,720
 Until I reached the other shore where Jesus was waiting for me

167
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:52,320
 I will never forget his first words to me, and in fact, he asked me a question

168
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:59,160
 He said, what do you want me to do for you?

169
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,560
 What do you mean, what do I want?

170
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:08,840
 No one has ever asked me such a question, who would care what a blind beggar wants?

171
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,840
 And if Jesus is king, I should be the one doing what he wants

172
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,200
 I should be the one bowing before him and said, your will be done my Lord

173
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,000
 I should be the one asking him that

174
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,800
 And yet, he's asking me what I want

175
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:41,040
 Here standing in front of me was a man who was king, and yet he acted like a servant

176
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,760
 With tears in my eyes, I uttered my wildest dream to him

177
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:57,640
 I said, my master, my Lord, I want to see

178
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,600
 I never dared to say those four words, I want to see to anyone in my life

179
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:13,280
 People would just call me silly, or they would say it's impossible, it's unrealistic, stop daydreaming

180
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,760
 I never imagined someone would care to listen

181
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:26,800
 Just now I told you, when I used to listen to God's word in the synagogue, I felt I'm normal

182
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,680
 But you know what, that day I suddenly realized

183
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:39,200
 I felt I was a normal person when someone actually stopped to listen to me

184
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:47,520
 And what really blew my mind was that that someone standing there asking what I wanted

185
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:55,760
 Listening to my every word, he was God himself

186
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,040
 "Go," he said, "your faith has healed you"

187
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:09,040
 Before he finished that sentence, I felt this warmth, this burning sensation in my eyes

188
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:17,520
 And then it was brightness, it's like walking out of a completely dark room into the bright sunny day

189
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,000
 My faith in Jesus opened my eyes

190
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:29,560
 And when I looked up, I saw a face, I saw the face

191
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,080
 I remember in the synagogue, they used to pray this blessing over us

192
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,440
 The Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you

193
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,520
 The Lord turns his face towards you and give you peace

194
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,920
 That's the face I saw that day

195
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,200
 That's the very first face indeed in my life I've ever seen

196
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:03,480
 And that's the face I'm gonna see in eternity, the face of Jesus

197
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,880
 At that moment, I knew I wanted to follow him for the rest of my life

198
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,960
 I knew I'll go wherever he goes

199
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,440
 He's my healer, he's my savior, he's my king

200
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,000
 I want to spend the rest of my life asking him, "What do you want me to do for you?"

201
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,440
 Or even better, "What do you want me to do with you, Lord?"

202
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,000
 I was a blind beggar sitting on the side of the road

203
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,360
 But Jesus came, he stopped, he listened, and he responded

204
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:49,080
 So I'm telling you guys, today if you cry out to him, he would do the same for you

205
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:56,640
 He would come into your life, he would stop for you, he would listen to you, and he would respond

206
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,520
 What is that you want to tell him today?

207
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:07,720
 Where in your life you need him to heal you and save you, to zozo you

208
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:15,360
 Come to him today and cry out to him, "Jesus, have mercy on me"

209
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:35,960
 Greetings, my dear friends

210
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Peace be with you

211
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,080
 Oh, thank you for that

212
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,120
 How are you guys doing today?

213
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,600
 My name is John

214
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,920
 I'm one of the disciples of Jesus

215
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,360
 Isn't the story of Bartimaeus amazing?

216
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,280
 Can we give him a round of applause?

217
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,040
 But I want to tell you this

218
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,840
 What's even more wonderful for me personally

219
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:11,040
 is that the day when Bartimaeus received his sight, I received mine too

220
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,400
 The day when his eyes were open, so were mine

221
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,480
 I remember that day very well

222
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:26,000
 It was the final days we spent with Jesus before he was arrested, he was tortured, and finally crucified in Jerusalem

223
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,880
 In fact, we were on our way there, we were walking towards Jerusalem

224
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:38,520
 And we came all the way from Galilee, and then we passed through Jericho in Judea, and we were headed towards Jerusalem

225
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:47,960
 And that was the Passover period, so there were lots of people going to Jerusalem alongside us, and we had a large crowd following us

226
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:56,520
 And you know Jesus, just being Jesus himself, he would seize every opportunity to teach the people about the kingdom of God

227
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,920
 But I could tell, being his friend, he was quite burdened inside

228
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:12,880
 It's in the small details, it's in the way how he looked at us, it's in the way how he would spend longer time away from us in solitude, like just praying by himself

229
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:25,080
 And he also told us, not just once, not just twice, but three times, that whatever is in store for him in Jerusalem, it's pain, and suffering, and death

230
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,800
 He said he's going to be killed there

231
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,200
 You know, of course, none of us wanted that to happen, right? He's a good friend, he's a rabbi

232
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:41,840
 And my best buddy Peter actually tried to talk him out of it, but yeah, it didn't end too well for him

233
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:50,240
 But even what's more bizarre was that he told us after he died, he would rise again in three days

234
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,000
 We had no idea what he was talking about

235
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:07,680
 But so far, let me tell you, following Jesus, yeah, that kind of life is nothing short of miracles, surprises, and also riddles that none of us really understood

236
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:14,800
 The one thing we were sure though was that he was the son of God, and he is the son of God

237
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,040
 He's the Messiah that we've been waiting for

238
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:23,560
 We even saw him talking to Moses and Elijah on the top of a mountain

239
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:30,520
 He is going to be a Messiah, and what that means is he should be a conquering king

240
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:37,520
 He will lead us in glorious victories and establish his kingdom over those Romans and other Gentiles

241
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,240
 At least that was what I was told, and what I had believed ever since I was a boy

242
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,280
 So that day, yeah, back to the story, that day we were passing by Jericho

243
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,320
 And everybody cheered for us like what you did just now

244
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,160
 The whole town gathered literally on the two sides of the road just to see Jesus

245
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:10,440
 After all the miracles and all the healings, you wouldn't be surprised if Jesus is the most popular, famous Jewish man on the planet, right?

246
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,760
 Everybody wants a piece of him

247
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,160
 So sometimes I feel a little bit overwhelmed and oh, that's too much

248
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,480
 And you know, me and my brother James, we volunteered to be Jesus' bodyguards

249
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,360
 Like hey, stop, stop there, we're his security detail

250
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,560
 And we would exercise a little bit of crowd control

251
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,240
 Okay, just let me tell you a fun fact, me and my brother James, we have a nickname

252
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,440
 We're called the sons of thunder, because of our temper I guess

253
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:44,440
 Anyway, but suddenly that day when we were getting out of Jericho, we heard a voice, a very loud voice that says

254
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,840
 Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me

255
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,240
 Oh, son of David, huh, this guy knew what he was talking about, huh?

256
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,840
 It seems we're not the only one who believe Jesus is the Messiah, because that's what that phrase son of David means

257
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,920
 So I tried to look around, but I don't see who's talking

258
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,760
 And perhaps there was just too many people

259
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:15,640
 So then someone from the crowd just told me, oh, it's just a beggar, he was probably asking for money

260
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,680
 I'm like, okay, if he thinks Jesus is a rich Messiah, then he must be misguided

261
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,880
 Well, look at us, look at me, do I look rich to you guys?

262
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,040
 I'm not rich, Jesus is not rich

263
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,760
 But all right, anyway, just a beggar, just looking for money, false alarm, let's move on, let's carry on

264
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,320
 We got to go find a place to rest before sunset, you know?

265
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,080
 It's really dangerous out here in the wilderness in Judea

266
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:47,760
 But just as I was taking a few more steps down the road, that same voice yelled again, son of David, have mercy on me

267
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,960
 And I thought, okay, I'm the bodyguard, I should deal with that

268
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,440
 But before I walked to deal with him, Jesus, he stopped

269
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:09,360
 I'm like, oh, come on, if someone has any spare food for this guy, let's just give it to him so we can all be on our way

270
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,240
 Come on, come on, I don't have time

271
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,280
 You know, now a glorious journey to Jerusalem, it's going to be delayed

272
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,840
 Who knows what's going to happen in Jerusalem?

273
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,920
 Jesus may actually become king there, you know, and we would have a royal status

274
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,000
 He's messing with our schedule right now, could somebody just take care of him?

275
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,480
 You see, when would the procession of a king be interrupted by some homeless man, right?

276
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,680
 So we just want to go, and Jesus says, call him

277
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,560
 You know, his voice is always so gentle, yet full of authority

278
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,920
 And so we did, we called that guy over

279
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,720
 And a few moments later, we met the guy with a loud voice

280
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,920
 And on top of that, he also had long and dirty hair, he had worn out clothes, and some very unpleasant smell

281
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,840
 Oh, that guy was blind

282
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:15,360
 So Jesus looked at him and said, "What do you want me to do for you?"

283
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,280
 Wait, what did he just say?

284
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,600
 I immediately turned and looked at my brother James, and he did the same, he just looked at me

285
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:30,080
 Because the day before, Jesus asked the two of us the exact same question

286
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,000
 See, we were on the journey to Jerusalem, and we knew something big, something important was going to happen

287
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,400
 So of course Jesus mentioned, you know, he was going to suffer and die and all that, we know

288
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,280
 But James and I, we decided to go and talk to Jesus

289
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,400
 And we said, you know, we've been following you for so long, and since the beginning, we were your first disciples

290
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,760
 You know, surely we deserve a front seat in the kingdom of God, right?

291
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,320
 Can I get an amen for that?

292
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,400
 No, none of you agree with me, that's okay

293
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:04,160
 And so we asked Jesus, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask"

294
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,160
 And Jesus asked the same question, "What do you want me to do for you?"

295
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,360
 Well, we shamelessly asked to sit at his right and his left

296
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,760
 Yeah, we want the fame, we want the power, right?

297
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,760
 Come on, we have laid down literally everything to follow Jesus in the last three years

298
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:31,600
 We were by his side the whole time, and that's what we deserve, that's what we are entitled to, right?

299
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,120
 But look at this blind beggar, what did he do to deserve this?

300
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:44,240
 What has he done to earn this favor that the Messiah himself would do something for him?

301
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,320
 He hasn't followed Jesus for a single day, he never preached the good news of the kingdom like we did

302
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,760
 He never healed a sick person or drive out a demon like we have, why would he deserve this?

303
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,560
 And I heard he said, "My master, my Lord, I want to see"

304
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:10,240
 And yet, there he goes, once again, as always, the miracle happened

305
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,960
 And Bartimaeus, he immediately joined the company and followed Jesus

306
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,520
 He became part of us, he became our brother

307
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:29,280
 And then I realized, Jesus didn't stop to perform a miracle

308
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,840
 Jesus actually was there to call a man

309
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,160
 Just like the day when he called me and my brother James and Peter

310
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:44,920
 He stopped and performed a miracle for us and called us to follow him

311
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:52,000
 Whatever Jesus saw in me, he saw in Bartimaeus too

312
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,160
 Who am I to think that I deserve and he doesn't?

313
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:05,160
 Isn't it only because of Jesus' grace that we are both saved and restored?

314
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:17,000
 That day, outside the city of Jericho, when Jesus opened the eyes of Bartimaeus, he opened mine too

315
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,640
 While Bartimaeus, he could be physically blind, I, myself, and many other disciples

316
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,040
 We were indeed spiritually blind

317
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,240
 We were blind to who Jesus was and his real mission here on earth

318
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,200
 We were so obsessed with the image of a conquering king

319
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,480
 That we were blind to the suffering servant right in front of our eyes

320
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,480
 We were so obsessed with the success and achievements we want Jesus to give us

321
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:55,600
 That we were blind to his call, which is to follow his examples and serve those around us

322
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,800
 Our role as his disciples should be, supposed to be, to bring people to him

323
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,920
 Not to stop them from coming to him

324
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,360
 And we've been doing such a poor job

325
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:17,880
 And no wonder we're also blind to the poor, to the vulnerable, to the marginalized, to the needies around us

326
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,400
 In our spiritual blindness, we only focus on what we can gain in this life

327
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,960
 And we forgot what we could give

328
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,400
 We ignore the marginalized, we say that their problem is not our problem

329
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,000
 What's even worse, when they try to voice out their problems, we silence them

330
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,360
 We tell them this is not the place and time to say these things

331
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,080
 Let's do it later, let's don't do it here, we don't have time for you

332
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,640
 But Jesus, Jesus doesn't stop people from expressing their needs

333
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:58,960
 Instead, he stops for them, he sees them, he listens, he responds

334
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,240
 Jesus doesn't just want to heal the physically blind

335
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,680
 He also wants to open the eyes of the spiritually blind as well

336
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,400
 What kind of a church are we?

337
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,120
 Are we a spiritually blind church?

338
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,880
 Are we a spiritually blind disciple?

339
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,120
 That we are blind to the needs of those around us

340
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,040
 That we just turn a blind eye and we look away

341
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:32,680
 Or are we blind to who Jesus really is and what he wants to achieve in this earth?

342
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:43,720
 Are we spiritually blind that we actually can't see Jesus' heart for the others?

343
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,600
 That day Jesus opened my eyes

344
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,240
 I once was lost, but now I'm found

345
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,200
 I was blind, but now I see

346
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,280
 I know what kind of a disciple I want to be since that day

347
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,160
 I want to be the kind of disciple of Jesus that would stop for people

348
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,760
 That would see people as people

349
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,080
 That would listen to them, that would respond to their need

350
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,760
 And what about you, my friends?

351
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:21,280
 What kind of a Jesus follower would you want to be?

352
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,120
 I wonder where you find yourself outside the city of Jericho today

353
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,000
 Are you the one sitting at the side of the road?

354
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
 Like Bartimaeus

355
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,200
 And you're carrying with you a physical condition perhaps

356
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,440
 Or maybe an emotional or even a relational issue

357
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,840
 And you need to cry out for Jesus' help

358
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,520
 Or perhaps you're one of those standing in the crowd like the disciples

359
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,320
 Suffering from spiritual blindness

360
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,960
 You're either blind to Jesus, his identity and his mission on earth

361
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,320
 Or maybe you're blind to the needs around you

362
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,920
 You know, if you're blind to the needs of the people around you

363
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,640
 That affects not just how you would interact with them

364
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:09,040
 That affects how God would interact with them through you as well

365
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,760
 So no matter where you are today

366
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,400
 Jesus is here and he wants to heal you and save you

367
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
 To zozo you

368
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,320
 All you need is to say, "Have mercy on me, Lord"

369
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,280
 And I'm just wondering right across this room right now

370
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,720
 Who would love to pray this prayer with me?

371
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,640
 I myself, I definitely need to pray this prayer

372
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,120
 Lord, have mercy on me, open my eyes

373
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,640
 I wonder who wants to join me in this prayer

374
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,720
 If that's you, I invite you to stand where you are and close your eyes

375
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,080
 You know, sometimes it doesn't really matter what we're seeing physically

376
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,920
 It matters even more what we can see spiritually

377
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,120
 And Jesus, he's so kind, he's so faithful, he's so loving

378
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,800
 He wants to open your eyes and my eyes here today

379
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,520
 So, church, I can't do this on your behalf

380
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,040
 You must come to him

381
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,440
 I can only show you the way to Jesus

382
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,240
 And you have to be the one to cry out to him

383
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,000
 Have mercy on me, Lord

384
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,040
 Why don't we do it now?

385
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:32,040
 (Silence)

386
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,880
 Jesus, you didn't just heal Bartimaeus that day

387
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,680
 You didn't just open his physically blind eyes

388
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,880
 You healed your disciples

389
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,480
 You healed their spiritual blindness

390
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,960
 And God, today I pray that you would come into this place and do the same

391
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,920
 Whether it's a physical condition that needs to be zozoed

392
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,560
 Maybe an emotional one, a relational one, a mental one

393
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,040
 Jesus, I pray you would so kindly come and zozo us

394
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,760
 But I also ask you would come and open our eyes

395
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,680
 Especially those of us who are spiritually blind like myself

396
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,880
 That we won't turn a blind eye to the people around us

397
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,160
 Here in Yuen Long, here in Hong Kong

398
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,040
 Or maybe just right next door our neighbours

399
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,600
 The person sitting next to us in the office

400
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,680
 Or when we are on the streets, those who need you

401
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:37,440
 Father, I pray that we would not just write them off casually

402
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,960
 And we wouldn't just walk past them without even looking at them

403
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,520
 Not in a strange way but

404
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:50,240
 Father, I pray you would give us your vision, your perspective

405
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,120
 When we are walking the streets of Hong Kong, the streets of Yuen Long

406
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,920
 We would actually be able to see the need

407
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,960
 Or even to listen to them and respond to them

408
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,440
 Come Holy Spirit, help us

409
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:17,440
