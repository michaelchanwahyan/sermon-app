1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 (audience applauding)

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,900
 - Tim, I just feel for you that you come across,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,900
 you're a big man physically, right?

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,980
 But this season, God is making you

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,120
 into the big man spiritually.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,540
 You know, so actually, let's not be just pulled off

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,000
 by just looking at him.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,780
 God is doing something inside of him, right?

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,220
 And might be the fasting, right?

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,460
 But this is your season,

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,340
 and God is making you into a spiritual giant

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,620
 as well as a physical giant.

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,820
 Can I have amen to that?

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,660
 - Amen.

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,480
 (audience applauding)

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,320
 - Good.

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,180
 Well, happy new year to everyone.

18
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,100
 Salud, Falak.

19
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,460
 It's great to be here.

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,600
 A new year is a new opportunity.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,640
 Vine Church, Yunlong,

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,720
 you are about to enter into a new season.

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,340
 It will not look like what you've known before.

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:09,620
 God says, "I will do a new thing."

25
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,180
 As someone who's had a relationship with the Vine Church

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,180
 for almost 30 years, I am indeed honored and privileged

27
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,540
 to be asked to say a few words on this special day,

28
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,080
 New Year's Eve.

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,780
 And may I just say right up front,

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,620
 what a wonderful year it's been.

31
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:36,500
 From those months, those wonderful months preparing at EIS.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,340
 You'll remember those forever, won't you?

33
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,880
 It's amazing.

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,880
 The prayer walks, the social events, the barbecues,

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,600
 the Vision Sunday, generous offering.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,940
 We're here today because on one Sunday this year,

37
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,180
 people were moved to give enough money

38
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,940
 to actually finance this church.

39
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:06,760
 The official launch and this wonderful building.

40
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,860
 Beyond any of our wildest dreams,

41
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:20,380
 my first words, however, may be misconstrued

42
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,900
 as me being a bit of a killjoy.

43
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,660
 Almost as you say, putting a dampener

44
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,120
 on this joyous occasion.

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,100
 But I need to say them nonetheless.

46
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,700
 The church is not a building.

47
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,520
 You're allowed to say amen, by the way.

48
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,580
 Any Pentecostals here?

49
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,420
 Yeah, good.

50
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,660
 Church is not a building.

51
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,040
 The church is not a building.

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,020
 The word that Jesus was quoted as using

53
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,220
 that we translate as church, ecclesia,

54
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,820
 has nothing to do with a church building.

55
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,600
 But I think this conversation only goes to illustrate

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,380
 the confusion that many of us face

57
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,860
 with church being regarded as a place,

58
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,380
 as a building we go to, rather than a thing we are.

59
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,660
 But in a sense, it doesn't matter

60
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,540
 whether we meet in a beautiful crystal cathedral

61
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,140
 or an old scout hut.

62
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:33,660
 The church is us, the people of God.

63
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:40,540
 And I believe that this highly impressive building

64
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,900
 here at Ho Sun Lee is a conduit,

65
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,540
 a conduit for us meeting together to thank God,

66
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,860
 to thank God for his faithfulness and goodness

67
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,220
 at the vine for almost 30 years

68
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,600
 and for this amazing past year here at Yuen Long.

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,580
 But equally as important is to seek him

70
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,420
 for his presence in the present

71
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,940
 and to ask his guidance for the future.

72
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,980
 I believe this is one of possibly

73
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,540
 the most significant times in church history.

74
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,780
 Give or take a percentage point,

75
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,900
 around 94% of Hong Kong's population

76
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,900
 are currently not part of any church.

77
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,260
 Does that make you feel good?

78
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,700
 It doesn't make me feel good.

79
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,860
 Many in our city, especially the younger generation,

80
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,180
 have lost hope.

81
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,660
 We're seeing an increase in those suffering

82
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,700
 with mental health issues

83
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,940
 and an alarming rise in teenage suicides.

84
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,740
 And in case you haven't noticed,

85
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,060
 our poor seem to be getting poorer.

86
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,620
 What can we do?

87
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,140
 My friends, mark my words.

88
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,500
 This building is significant,

89
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,580
 but not as an aquarium to keep the fish in,

90
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:30,100
 but as a launching pad for the lifeboats.

91
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,860
 Can I say that again?

92
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,100
 A launching pad for the lifeboats.

93
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,540
 Down those stairs and out there.

94
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,820
 I see this building as an equipping center,

95
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,500
 equipping the saints to man the lifeboats

96
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,140
 to be sent to the lost,

97
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,820
 the lonely, those who've lost hope.

98
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,460
 And I believe there are many fish

99
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,460
 to be caught right here in Yuen Long.

100
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:07,220
 I declare today that Yuen Long is a freaking village.

101
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,060
 - Amen.

102
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,460
 - An ocean full of fish ready to be caught.

103
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,940
 As I prayed this week, I saw a picture.

104
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,180
 I saw it in two halves.

105
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,900
 The first half was about today.

106
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,500
 The people of this church were gathered together

107
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,500
 and we were like young eaglets in an eagle's nest.

108
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,340
 Safe together, nestling in the mother's arms.

109
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,820
 They were in close community with each other.

110
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,060
 And I think that describes the Vine Yuen Long very, very well.

111
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,100
 You enjoy wonderful community.

112
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:58,900
 But in the second scene, the eaglets had grown.

113
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:05,180
 And I saw squadrons of eagles swarming out from Hong San Lee

114
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,460
 to the people of Yuen Long,

115
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,300
 to the people of Hong Kong and beyond.

116
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:19,300
 This building is to be that nurture place.

117
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,820
 This building is to be that nurture place

118
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,220
 where, oh yes, you enjoy community

119
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,260
 and please go on enjoying community.

120
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,180
 But where you are also prepared, trained,

121
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,860
 equipped to be sent to where the church of Hong Kong

122
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,860
 really is, in our offices, in our schools

123
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,060
 and the housing estates of our city.

124
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,380
 And in that respect, I wanna share a verse.

125
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,500
 It is the motivating verse for this message.

126
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,380
 It is my prayer.

127
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,420
 It is my dream for this church in 2024.

128
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,740
 And I believe that this verse describes you.

129
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,300
 The people who call Vine Yuen Long their home church.

130
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,580
 It's Psalm 1,3.

131
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,140
 That person, Tim,

132
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:28,660
 that person, Darius,

133
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,700
 is like a tree planted by streams of water

134
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,220
 which yields its fruit in season

135
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,860
 and whose leaf does not wither,

136
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,580
 whatever they do, prospers.

137
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,780
 Now, read my lips for a moment.

138
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:57,900
 There is no room in this church for spectators.

139
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,460
 Or to be on any church, to be honest.

140
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,260
 Christianity is not a spectator sport.

141
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,060
 The Psalmist has already told us this in verse one.

142
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,260
 Blessed is the one who does not walk in the step

143
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,420
 with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take

144
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,500
 or sit in the company of mockers,

145
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,700
 but whose delight is in the law of the Lord

146
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,700
 and who meditates on his law day and night.

147
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,780
 And can I just back up what Tim said about the fast?

148
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,740
 Fast is not about what you give up.

149
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,940
 Fast is about what you gain.

150
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,500
 Meditate on his word day and night.

151
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,780
 And I will come back to blessing at the end of my talk.

152
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,100
 But this got me thinking.

153
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,820
 Everybody sort of wants a successful life.

154
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,860
 Church is always talking about having successful ministries.

155
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,580
 But what is it?

156
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:09,620
 The promise of success here is qualified by the context.

157
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,700
 Whatever they do and whatever they do will be determined

158
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,860
 by living in obedience to the scriptures.

159
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,140
 Whose delight is in the law of the Lord

160
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,180
 who meditates on his law day and night.

161
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,140
 That is what will prosper.

162
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,740
 And what I wanna do now is move from,

163
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,060
 churches often talk about doing preaching verse by verse.

164
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,540
 It's very popular in churches.

165
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,460
 I'm gonna move to something

166
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,020
 which I'm gonna call word by word preaching.

167
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,860
 And I wanna end up with six definitions of success.

168
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,940
 This is my prayer for you for 2024.

169
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,980
 And they are all in verse three.

170
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,860
 And they are all linked to the sense

171
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,180
 of a tree being planted by streams of water.

172
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,380
 And you will love this.

173
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,300
 They all begin with the letter P.

174
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:13,220
 Ironically, the world might come up with the same six P's.

175
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,660
 But I want you to see them through the lens

176
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,740
 of a tree planted by streams of water.

177
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,740
 Through as it were Psalm 1,3 tinted glasses.

178
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,180
 And the first P is this prominence.

179
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,220
 It says like a tree.

180
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,620
 Trees are prominent.

181
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,260
 To be prominent is to be widely known.

182
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:45,220
 We are to project outward from the line

183
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,660
 we started in our faith.

184
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,340
 A tree is a prominent part of nature.

185
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,740
 And I wanna say to you,

186
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,340
 it is not wrong to be prominent in the world.

187
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:04,380
 Billy Graham was friends with 13 US presidents

188
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,060
 from Harry S. Truman to Donald J. Trump.

189
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:14,020
 It is time to let our faith be known.

190
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,540
 Can I repeat that?

191
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,020
 It is time to let our faith be known.

192
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,820
 Always move forward.

193
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,100
 We are to be bold like a tree.

194
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:32,580
 Just like a tree is always growing, so should our faith.

195
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,860
 No one's faith can stand still.

196
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,980
 It either goes forward or backwards.

197
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:43,900
 The second P is permanence.

198
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,420
 The word is planted here.

199
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,180
 This quality of the Christian life is crucial.

200
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,940
 We need to be permanently planted in God's word.

201
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,820
 We need to be permanent with our faith

202
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,540
 and not let anything shake us.

203
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,500
 We've been singing about that all morning.

204
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,540
 Not let the things of the world shake us.

205
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,700
 We are to be rooted by the word of God.

206
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,620
 Rooted by the words of God.

207
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,300
 That means if a decision comes up, a problem or a doubt,

208
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,340
 we should always refer to God's word for assurance.

209
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,060
 This permanence gives us security.

210
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,180
 There are just too many Christians out there

211
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,060
 who float in the wind

212
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,380
 and compromise their faith with the world.

213
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:39,900
 We are to stand firm with security and permanence.

214
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,060
 Then there is position.

215
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,260
 This is important.

216
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,060
 It says here, planted by streams of water.

217
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,780
 As important as it is to be planted,

218
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,940
 we must make sure we don't plant ourselves

219
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,380
 outside in a field that's gonna be chopped down

220
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,700
 by lumber workers.

221
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,300
 We are to plant ourselves by streams of water.

222
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,060
 Water nourishes and feeds the tree

223
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,260
 to grow strong and permanent.

224
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,780
 Just like the tree has water,

225
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,700
 we need God's word and God's Holy Spirit

226
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,740
 to nourish us, to feed us, and to counsel us.

227
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,380
 We need God's word, but we need God's Holy Spirit.

228
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,780
 The fourth P is productivity.

229
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,860
 The word here is fruit.

230
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,140
 It will bear fruit.

231
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,660
 When a tree is healthy, drinking water,

232
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,780
 and firmly planted, it doesn't only grow,

233
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,780
 but it bears fruit.

234
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,980
 If we are reading and meditating on God's word,

235
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,180
 if we are being constantly filled with the Holy Spirit,

236
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,380
 if we are positioning ourselves in the correct area

237
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,580
 and firmly plant ourselves,

238
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,500
 we too will bear fruit for Jesus.

239
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,220
 By our fruit, people will be able to tell

240
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,860
 what really matters to us.

241
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,060
 I wanna ask you a question.

242
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,620
 What is the fruit of your life?

243
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,220
 Do you have any fruit?

244
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,140
 Is your fruit sour or sweet?

245
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,340
 What type of fruit is your life producing?

246
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,980
 The fifth P is perpetuity.

247
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,140
 It says the leaf does not wither.

248
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,460
 We are to be in a state of being perpetual.

249
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,260
 That is never ending for eternity.

250
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,540
 Our leaf does not wither when life gets stormy.

251
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,980
 We had a few typhoons this year,

252
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,940
 haven't we in Hong Kong, T10.

253
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,580
 What happens to you when your life gets stormy?

254
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,660
 We need to look at trials.

255
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,140
 We need to look at the typhoons in life

256
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,860
 as a test that will only make us stronger.

257
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,700
 We cannot fold to harsh times and bad weather.

258
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:16,060
 The leaf of God does not wither and we are the leaf.

259
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,900
 My friends, do not give in.

260
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,900
 There will be times in 2024

261
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,020
 when every one of us will feel like giving in.

262
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,780
 Do not give in.

263
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,500
 My last P is prosperity.

264
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,980
 It says whatever they do will prosper.

265
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,540
 If we abide in God, everything we do will prosper.

266
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:48,300
 We may not always see it that way or even ever see it.

267
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:54,780
 We must choose what we want our ministry on earth

268
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,620
 to be about.

269
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,900
 Is it to be about us

270
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,740
 or is it to be about the generations to come?

271
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:08,340
 We need to leave a legacy for Christ, not our name.

272
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:13,020
 That's my 2024 challenge to you.

273
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,540
 Who are you leaving a legacy to?

274
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,900
 Who's coming after you?

275
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,300
 Who are you sowing into?

276
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,540
 I want to encourage each one of you to find someone

277
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,620
 that you can actually regularly find time

278
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,700
 to sow into their lives.

279
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,300
 My 2024 prayer for you is for an intellectually

280
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,140
 excellent mind.

281
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,260
 One is that is informed,

282
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,660
 one that makes important distinctions

283
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,900
 when a less mature mind fails to do so.

284
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,980
 One that has deeper and deeper insights

285
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,580
 into issues of importance.

286
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:56,300
 Be planted by streams of water.

287
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,540
 Simple, be planted.

288
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,860
 Who are the people you're spending time with?

289
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,380
 Where are you getting fed?

290
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,020
 Be saturated in God's word

291
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,100
 and saturated in God's Holy Spirit.

292
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,060
 And you will be blessed.

293
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,260
 Our church will be blessed.

294
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:26,820
 And most importantly, our city will be blessed.

295
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,340
 Our city will be blessed.

296
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,620
 What I want to say as I'm moving towards a conclusion

297
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,940
 is I want to bless you.

298
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,420
 I want to bless you dear church

299
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,300
 for the past, the present and the future.

300
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:49,060
 As we come to the end of an eventful period in our history,

301
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,900
 the last word many of us might use

302
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,820
 to describe this period is blessing.

303
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,140
 In fact, some other words might come to mind.

304
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,260
 And yet blessing is an important aspect

305
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,980
 of our Hong Kong culture.

306
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,180
 We see the character fuk or fu everywhere.

307
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,700
 Meaning prosperity, fortune, good luck, happiness.

308
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,980
 It's most popular amongst the young children

309
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,700
 and the unmarried when we get to licy time

310
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,860
 at Lunar New Year.

311
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,980
 But fuk or fu can also mean blessing.

312
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,700
 And we as Christians use it in our vocabulary

313
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,660
 with phrases like (speaking in foreign language)

314
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,580
 God bless you.

315
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:41,380
 And blessing is also an important aspect of our faith life.

316
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,900
 It's mentioned over 400 times in scripture.

317
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,460
 In his song 10,000 Reasons,

318
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,460
 Matt Redmond encourages us, doesn't he?

319
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,300
 ♪ Bless the Lord, oh my soul ♪

320
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,220
 ♪ Bless the Lord, oh my soul ♪

321
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,100
 ♪ And all that is within me ♪

322
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,620
 ♪ Bless his holy name ♪

323
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,060
 From Psalm 103.

324
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,780
 In the New Testament in Ephesians one,

325
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,340
 we read, "Blessed be the God and father

326
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,060
 "of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ

327
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,500
 "with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places."

328
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,820
 Now that's a lot of blessing.

329
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,820
 But it leads me very nicely to highlight three blessings

330
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,540
 that the Bible mandates.

331
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,340
 I wanna take them one at a time.

332
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,540
 The first one is this.

333
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,980
 We are to bless God.

334
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,980
 As Christians, we surely say God blesses us.

335
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,460
 Even in these difficult past few years,

336
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,740
 God's blessings greatly outnumber the trials

337
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,620
 that came with virus, political unrest,

338
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,980
 and financial instability, without belittling

339
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,940
 or making light of the hardship that many of us have faced.

340
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,740
 But what does it mean that we can bless God?

341
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,460
 If God is perfect, how can we bless him?

342
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,580
 To bless God simply means to praise him

343
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,180
 or to honor his name.

344
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,300
 The Hebrew word translated bless in the Old Testament

345
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,380
 literally means to kneel,

346
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,020
 indicating the idea of honoring the Lord.

347
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,580
 We do not add anything to him when we bless him,

348
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,180
 yet we worship him as our appropriate response

349
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,620
 to say his greatness and his love for us.

350
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,380
 As we saw earlier in the Psalms,

351
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,540
 we often find verses that speak of blessing the Lord.

352
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,220
 Another example is found in Psalm 104, verse one.

353
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,940
 Bless the Lord, O my soul.

354
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,900
 There it is again.

355
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,540
 O Lord, my God, you are very great.

356
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:08,220
 You are clothed with honor and majesty.

357
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,260
 So that's the first thing, we're to bless God.

358
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:19,380
 And secondly, we are to bless each other.

359
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,580
 We know that we have been so greatly blessed.

360
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,780
 So many of us have been given so much,

361
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,460
 material goods, adequate incomes,

362
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,300
 families, friends, jobs, homes.

363
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,700
 Being part of the vine year long

364
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,180
 is in itself a huge blessing.

365
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,900
 That's just for starters.

366
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:50,500
 If you are a Christian, then whatever your circumstances,

367
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,580
 you have been given the greatest gifts,

368
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,780
 faith, hope, and love.

369
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,740
 You have been blessed with the means of grace

370
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,300
 and hope of glory.

371
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,300
 If you have Christ, you have been given everything

372
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,140
 that is eternally worthwhile.

373
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:17,420
 So the big question is why?

374
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,260
 Why have I, why have you been so blessed?

375
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,140
 And the answer to that question is found in Genesis 12,

376
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,660
 verses two to three.

377
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,300
 We call it the Abrahamic covenant.

378
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,860
 This is God's promise to Abraham.

379
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,060
 God said to Abraham, now bear in mind

380
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,900
 when God said this promise to Abraham,

381
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,460
 Abraham was about 90 years of age, right?

382
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,420
 His wife was barren and he had no kids, right?

383
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,060
 And he said, "I will make you a great nation

384
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,260
 "and I will bless you and I will make your name great

385
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,740
 "so that, so that,

386
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,260
 "so that you will be a blessing.

387
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,180
 "I will bless those who bless you

388
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,180
 "and the one who curses you, I will curse.

389
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,180
 "And in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed."

390
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:23,620
 God was saying to Abraham and is saying to us today,

391
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,860
 "I bless you, you bless others."

392
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,460
 Simple, I will bless you, yes.

393
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,380
 So that, so that you will bless others.

394
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,100
 Can I challenge you today and every day

395
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,300
 to ask God, who can I be a blessing to today?

396
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:56,860
 A smile, can we try it by the way?

397
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,140
 Yeah, you can smile, good, a smile.

398
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,980
 Do you know what it can mean so much?

399
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:11,340
 A kind word, an act of service.

400
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,420
 Oh, by the way, can some people in Hong Kong

401
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,460
 start pressing the door open button on the left

402
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,220
 instead of door close button?

403
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,140
 That's a blessing.

404
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,500
 Have you noticed, right?

405
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,820
 The door close button's worn out, right?

406
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,740
 The door open is pristine, right?

407
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,020
 No, nothing's on it, yeah.

408
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,620
 Start blessing people by holding the lift for them.

409
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,220
 That's a very simple one, right?

410
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:41,060
 A compassionate heart will share God's love

411
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,860
 with those who perhaps may be feeling overwhelmed

412
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,340
 by circumstances.

413
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,860
 So we have to bless God.

414
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,020
 We're to bless God and we are to bless each other.

415
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,940
 And thirdly, we are to bless our city.

416
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,300
 There's almost an amen there, good, I like it.

417
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,740
 Proverbs 11, 11 says, "Through the blessing

418
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,060
 "of the upright," that's us,

419
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,320
 "Through the blessing of the upright,

420
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,220
 "a city will be exalted."

421
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,520
 Wow, stick this on your fridge.

422
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,460
 Hong Kong is our home.

423
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,740
 Its people are our family.

424
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:32,860
 If we were to begin each day with a short prayer

425
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,700
 to bless Hong Kong, bless its people,

426
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,400
 and oh yes, bless the vine.

427
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,260
 And bless every other church in our city as well

428
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,180
 at the same time.

429
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,900
 I believe that we would very soon see a change

430
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,120
 in the spiritual atmosphere here.

431
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,120
 Dr. Ed Silvozo, a friend of mine,

432
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,760
 in his excellent book, "Prayer Evangelism,"

433
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,200
 how to change the spiritual climate

434
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,980
 over your home, neighborhood, and city,

435
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,680
 lists four steps based on Jesus' instructions

436
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,620
 to the 72 disciples in Luke 10.

437
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,760
 He says this, "Number one, bless them.

438
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,580
 "Number two, fellowship with them.

439
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,220
 "Number three, take care of their needs.

440
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,860
 "And then, at the bottom of the pile,

441
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,800
 "proclaim the good news."

442
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:38,820
 Step one is blessing.

443
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,080
 Dr. Ed describes it as speaking peace to them.

444
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,680
 He says, "Bless, befriend, care, share,

445
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,240
 "bless, befriend, care, share."

446
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,000
 How often do churches do it the other way around?

447
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,960
 We organize programs, courses, activities,

448
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,900
 where we should start by blessing.

449
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,180
 So let's begin today.

450
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,200
 I wanna finish by praying a priestly blessing upon you.

451
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,920
 It's called an Aaronic blessing,

452
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,500
 after Aaron from the book of Numbers.

453
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,320
 And we sang the song earlier, inspired Carrie Jobe

454
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,240
 and Cody Cairns to write the song "Blessing."

455
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,840
 There's been sung all around the world in many languages.

456
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,300
 In fact, at the first service, we sang it in Cantonese.

457
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,720
 We're gonna sing it again in a few minutes.

458
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,560
 And I invite the band to come back and you to stand, please.

459
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,000
 I wanna give you the reference point.

460
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,220
 It comes from Numbers 6, 24 to 26.

461
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,780
 It says, "The Lord bless you and keep you.

462
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,440
 "The Lord make his face to shine upon you

463
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,820
 "and be gracious to you.

464
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,720
 "The Lord lift up his countenance upon you

465
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,000
 "and give you peace."

466
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,020
 You might remember at the beginning of the sermon,

467
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,980
 I started a little bit controversially

468
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,000
 by talking about the church building.

469
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,480
 And I'm gonna finish on a similar controversial thing.

470
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,460
 I love this song, but whenever I hear it sung in church,

471
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,160
 we always sing it wrong.

472
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,800
 I see what I see, we sing this song.

473
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,540
 I see congregation members with their eyes closed,

474
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,480
 maybe their arms raised singing to God.

475
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,160
 This is not meant to be sung to God.

476
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:55,180
 We are meant to be singing this to each other.

477
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:00,880
 It is not, "Bless the Lord, O my soul."

478
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,640
 We might do that afterwards.

479
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,280
 So what I'm proposing in line with my three points,

480
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,600
 all good sermons have three points,

481
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,240
 is this, in a moment we're gonna pray a prayer

482
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,060
 to bless God.

483
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,420
 It's right to do that.

484
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:26,560
 Then as we sing the verse, "The Lord bless you."

485
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
 The Lord bless you.

486
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,200
 I'm gonna suggest we just sing it to each other.

487
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,040
 Ivan.

488
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,600
 ♪ The Lord bless you and keep you ♪

489
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,120
 We sing it to each other.

490
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,560
 Now this is a little bit strange, you know,

491
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,920
 particularly those that are Englishmen,

492
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,320
 you know, don't like this sort of thing.

493
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,160
 The Lord bless you.

494
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,720
 We're gonna sing this to each other.

495
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,800
 We're gonna rejoice in this as we sing it to each other.

496
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,360
 In 2024, we're going to a new year

497
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,680
 and we're singing over each other,

498
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,600
 "Lord bless you and keep you."

499
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,520
 For the second time we sing it,

500
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,120
 we're gonna face the outside world.

501
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,720
 We're gonna face you and Long.

502
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,440
 For one easy way we go there,

503
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,000
 I know you and Long's that way and that way,

504
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,680
 but we've got stairs here.

505
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,520
 And we're gonna sing out over you and Long.

506
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,640
 You and Long, the Lord bless you.

507
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,880
 Yeah, we're gonna do it.

508
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,860
 We're gonna sing over our beloved city.

509
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,560
 By the time you get to the amens,

510
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,320
 and there's loads of those,

511
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,720
 anything might be happening.

512
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,360
 But what we're gonna do is this.

513
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,800
 We're gonna bless God.

514
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,120
 We're gonna bless each other.

515
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,480
 And we're gonna bless our city.

516
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,600
 Can I hear amen to that?

517
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,440
 That was three of you.

518
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,280
 Let's try it again.

519
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,360
 Can I hear amen?

520
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,000
 Let's pray.

521
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,520
 Now this is the bit you can close your eyes for.

522
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,160
 I'm just telling you.

523
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,540
 You haven't got to look at anyone else.

524
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,400
 Dear God, we bless your holy name today.

525
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,200
 Thank you for your goodness.

526
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,480
 Thank you for your crown of steadfast love and mercy.

527
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,440
 We recognise all that you have done for us as a church

528
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,320
 and for every church in this city.

529
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,240
 And all that you continue to do now

530
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,280
 and all that you will do in the future.

531
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,700
 In Jesus' name.

532
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,640
 Amen.

533
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,480
 Bless you.

534
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,000
 Let's get ready to sing.

535
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,400
 To each other.

536
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,800
 Wow.

537
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,640
