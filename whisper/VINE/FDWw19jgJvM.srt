1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story brings.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 This church is not constricted by the walls of a building

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 but actively engaged in the community it is planted in

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 A church that sees salvation as holistic

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 transforming God's people for God's work

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 and equipping a generation to represent God's heart

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 to the poor, the weak, the oppressed and the persecuted.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Imagine this church committed to seeing the family as integral

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 to all that it is called to be and do

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 involving intentional, committed and authentic relationships across all levels.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 It is the sort of place where both the young and the old feel cared for

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 supported and equipped.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 come to feel at home.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 A cultural mosaic that honors and embraces a richness in diversity

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 that marks us as the body of Christ.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 A church that does not make its Sunday services

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 the exclamation mark of its existence

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 A time of service, love and engagement

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 that inspires and emboldens all equally for the conversation that lies ahead.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 This is our city.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 This is our church.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 This is our home.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Good morning and welcome to the Weinian Long.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 It is so good to see you.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I hope you all had a wonderful, lovely Christmas break.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I see some people coming back from having been overseas.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 It's good to have you.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Hey, I don't know what year 2023 has been like.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Maybe it's been challenging.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Maybe it's been like a normal year.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Maybe it's been an incredible year.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 But the one thing that we know is that God has been with us.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 He has been good every step of the way.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And we always have reason to praise Him, to give Him thanks.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 So I thought at the end of 2023 here,

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 let us take a moment and think about one thing that you are grateful for.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Okay, everybody think of one thing you are grateful for.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I'm going to make you do something with it, so you do have to think of one.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 All right.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And now turn to someone around you and share the thing that you are grateful for.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And just give God praise for what He has done.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Let's do that right now.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Oh, amen.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 [Music]

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 So praise God for His goodness.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 A lot of times we get to know His goodness, especially in difficult seasons.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But I want to invite everyone right now to stand as we enter in a time of worship.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And I will pray for us.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Let's pray.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Heavenly Father, we thank You so much for Your goodness, Your faithfulness,

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Your provision that You have been with us every step of the way.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 You are so good, and we can know Your goodness regardless of our outward circumstances.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Thank You that You are the one who brings us through, who lifts us up,

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 who carries us, and who just blesses us over and over again.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And right now, we want to lift up our praise and give You thanks for who You've been

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 and just tell You how amazing You are.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So I pray this in Your name, Jesus.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Amen.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Let's worship.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 All my words fall short

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I've got nothing new

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 How could I express

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 All my gratitude

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 I could sing these songs

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 As I often do

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 But every song must end

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And You never do

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 So I throw up my hands

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Praise You again and again

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 'Cause all that I have is a hallelujah

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Hallelujah

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And I know it's not much

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 But I've nothing else fit for a king

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Except for a heart singing

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Hallelujah

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Hallelujah

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 I've got one response

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 I've got just one move

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 With my arms stretched wide

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I will worship You, yeah

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 So I throw up my hands

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Praise You again and again

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 'Cause all that I have is a hallelujah

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Hallelujah

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And I know it's not much

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 But I've nothing else fit for a king

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Except for a heart singing

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Hallelujah

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Hallelujah

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Amen.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 I just really was so encouraged by Pastor Tim just making us,

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 not making us, but like, just encouraging us to think of one thing that we are thankful for.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And as I was just preparing for this worship set this week,

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 I just really want to encourage you all to just have that heart of gratitude.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 God has done many, many great things this year.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 No matter if you thought it was good or bad,

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 it was the Lord's will, and He will be faithful to carry you through it.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So God, I just pray now that as we sing the following words,

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 that we have that heart of gratitude.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 That we have that heart, that expecting heart,

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 that you're going to do something amazing in 2024.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Let's sing this out.

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Come on my soul

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Don't you get shy on me

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Lift up your soul

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 You've got a lion inside of those lungs

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Get up and praise the Lord

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Come on, speak it to your soul

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Come on my soul

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Don't you get shy on me

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Lift up your soul

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 You've got a lion inside of those lungs

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Get up and praise the Lord

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Sing it again. Come on my soul.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Come on my soul

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Don't you get shy on me

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Lift up your soul

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 You've got a lion inside of those lungs

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Get up and praise the Lord

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 One last time. Come on my soul.

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Come on my soul

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Don't you get shy on me

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Lift up your soul

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 You've got a lion inside of those lungs

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Get up and praise the Lord

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Praise you Jesus

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 So I throw up my hands

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Praise you again and again

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 'Cause all that I have is a Hallelujah

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Hallelujah

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And I know it's not much

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 But I've nothing else fit for a king

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Except for a heart singing

146
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Hallelujah

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Hallelujah

148
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Whoa, whoa, whoa

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 So I throw up my hands

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Praise you again and again

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Yes we do

152
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 'Cause all that I have is a Hallelujah

153
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Hallelujah

154
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And I know it's not much

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 But I've nothing else fit for a king

156
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Except for a heart singing

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Hallelujah

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Hallelujah

159
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 piano plays softly

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Grander earth has quaked before

161
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Moved by the sound of His voice

162
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And seas that are shaken and stirred

163
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Can be calmed and broken from my regard

164
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Let's sing that again, Grander Earth.

165
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And Grander Earth has quaked before

166
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Moved by the sound of His voice

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And seas that are shaken and stirred

168
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Can be calmed and broken from my regard

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Through it all, through it all, through it all

170
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 My eyes are on you

171
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Through it all, through it all, it is well

172
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on you

173
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And it is well with me

174
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 piano plays softly

175
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Far be it, far be it for me to not believe

176
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Even when my eyes can't see

177
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And this mountain that's in front of me

178
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Will be thrown into the midst of the sea

179
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Amen

180
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 And through it all, through it all, my eyes are on you

181
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Through it all, through it all, it is well

182
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on you

183
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 It is well, it is well

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Let go, let go my soul and trust in Him

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 The waves and wind still know His name

186
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Let go my soul and trust in Him

187
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 The waves and wind still know His name

188
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Come on, sing it to your spirit

189
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Let go my soul and trust in Him

190
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 The waves and wind still know His name

191
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 The waves and wind still know His name

192
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 It is well, it is well

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And with my soul

194
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 In every circumstance, it is well, Jesus

195
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 It is well, yes it is

196
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 With my soul

197
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 It is well, it is well

198
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Sing it out

199
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 With my soul

200
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 It is well, it is well

201
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 With my soul

202
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Sing that again, it is well

203
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And it is well

204
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 With my soul

205
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And it is well, it is well

206
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 With my soul

207
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 It is well, it is well

208
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 With my soul

209
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 One last time

210
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 It is well, it is well

211
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 With my soul

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Sing through it all

213
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Through it all, through it all

214
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 My hands are on You

215
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Through it all, through it all

216
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 It is well, Lord

217
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Through it all, through it all

218
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 My eyes are on You

219
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 It is well with me

220
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 As we were singing, I was thinking, this is our declaration.

221
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Regardless of what's going on, regardless of what you're going through, regardless of what 2024 holds for us,

222
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 it is well with our soul because Jesus is our Lord.

223
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 So we're declaring this. We're declaring this to be true.

224
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 So I want to invite you right now, we're going to sing this again,

225
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 and we're going to declare this over our lives, over each other, and over 2024.

226
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Let's sing this. Let's declare this.

227
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Let's sing "Let Go."

228
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 So let go my soul and trust in Him

229
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 The waves and wind still know His name

230
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Let go my soul and trust in Him

231
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 The waves and wind still know His name

232
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 The waves and wind

233
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 The waves and wind still know His name

234
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 It is well, and it is well

235
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 With my soul, yes it is, Lord

236
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And it is well, Lord

237
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 With my soul

238
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 It is well, it is well

239
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 With my soul

240
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 One last time.

241
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 It is well, it is well

242
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 With my soul

243
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Through it all, through it all

244
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 My eyes are on You

245
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Through it all, through it all

246
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 It is well

247
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Through it all, through it all

248
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 My eyes are on You, Jesus

249
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 It is well with me

250
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 It is well with me

251
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 It is well with me

252
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 It is well with me

253
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 It is well with me

254
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 So one of our congregation members has a prophetic word that she would like to share with us.

255
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 So let's welcome Falaki.

256
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 As we were worshipping the Lord Minister to me that there are people here and some of you,

257
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 you are trying to rise up from something and each time there is a weight that pulls you down.

258
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And there is something that just pulls you down.

259
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And each time you try and try, the Lord is saying it's not by power nor by might.

260
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And He's saying today, Isaiah 60, "Arise and shine for your light has come and the glory of God has risen upon you."

261
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 So that is the word that I received. Thank you.

262
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Thank you.

263
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 (Applause)

264
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Sing, "The Lord."

265
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 The Lord bless you and keep you.

266
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Make His face shine upon you.

267
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Be gracious to you.

268
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Lord, turn His face toward you and give you peace.

269
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Sing that again, "The Lord bless you."

270
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 The Lord bless you and keep you.

271
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Make His face shine upon you.

272
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Be gracious to you.

273
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Lord, turn His face toward you and give you peace.

274
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 And with one voice we all sing, "Amen."

275
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Amen. Amen. We sing, "Amen."

276
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Amen. Amen. Amen.

277
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 The Lord.

278
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 The Lord bless you and keep you.

279
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Make His face shine upon you.

280
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Be gracious to you.

281
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Lord, turn His face toward you and give you peace.

282
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Sing, "Amen."

283
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Amen. Amen. Amen. We sing, "Amen."

284
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Amen. Amen. Amen.

285
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 The Lord bless you and keep you.

286
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Make His face shine upon you.

287
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Be gracious to you.

288
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Lord, turn His face toward you and give you peace.

289
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And with one voice we all sing, "Amen."

290
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Amen. Amen. Amen.

291
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 The Lord bless you and keep you.

292
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Make His face shine upon you.

293
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Be gracious to you.

294
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Lord, turn His face toward you and give you peace.

295
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And with one voice we all sing, "Amen."

296
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Amen. Amen. Amen.

297
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 He is for you. He is for you. He is for you.

298
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 He is for you. Yeah.

299
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 We sing, "Amen."

300
00:24:49,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

301
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Sing one last time, "Amen."

302
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

303
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Jesus, we thank you that you are for us.

304
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 You are not against us.

305
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Thank you that you cause us to rise and not to fall.

306
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Thank you that you are the one who picks us up where we are stuck,

307
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 where we keep falling, and you bring us to the stand firm.

308
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Your word says that you pick us on the mirey clay,

309
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 that you set us on the solid rock, Lord.

310
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And so we declare this.

311
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 We thank you for this, that this is your work.

312
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 We thank you in your people's lives, the ones you love,

313
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 and you are for.

314
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 You are for us, not against us.

315
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And I pray that you would raise our faith,

316
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 that you would encourage us,

317
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 that you would raise our hope as a congregation, as a community,

318
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 that what we would know this truth, that we would believe it,

319
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 that we would not forget this, that we would speak this to each other.

320
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 We pray all this in your name, Jesus.

321
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Amen, amen.

322
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Wow.

323
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Thank you, worship team, for leading us so beautifully.

324
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 You may be seated.

325
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Thank you for the prophetic word.

326
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 You know, this is something that we, as a Vine church,

327
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 that's always been important to us, that we're open to the Holy Spirit,

328
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 how the Spirit leads what he says,

329
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 and how he wants to encourage people.

330
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And I was encouraged, and I believe others were as well,

331
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 and that this word was for some that forlucky shared.

332
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Right now, I want to say hello to those of you here for the first time.

333
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 If you don't mind slipping up your hand, just give us a little wave.

334
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 We're just going to say hi, don't worry.

335
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Welcome.

336
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Thank you so much for being with us.

337
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Yes, it's great to have you.

338
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 There's a QR code up here.

339
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 If you want us to help you get connected, you can fill this out.

340
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Later on on the screens, we turn them off during the service,

341
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 but there's also a WhatsApp communication channel.

342
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 If you subscribe to that channel, you get -- whenever something's happening,

343
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 we text it out so you know what's going on so you can go there after the service.

344
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Right now, we want to pray for our children.

345
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Kids, it's always so good to have you with us as part of our church,

346
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 part of our worship, and we want to pray for them right now.

347
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 So if you want to stretch out your hand, and let's pray over them.

348
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Jesus, we thank you so much for our children, for every single child that is here,

349
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 that you love them.

350
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 We pray that they know that you love them and that here it's a safe environment

351
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 to encounter you, to grow their own personal relationship with you,

352
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 and we pray that you bless them today as they go

353
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 and have a special party today in their K4C class.

354
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 So we pray that you release your joy, and we pray all this in your name, Jesus.

355
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Amen. Amen.

356
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 All right, parents, you may bring your children, three to five,

357
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 and actually they're all together today, so you can bring them to the library.

358
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 If you have a toddler, and so we have a crash room, the sermon is streamed,

359
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 so you're always welcome to go in there as well.

360
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 The toddler can play if that is something that is helpful to you.

361
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 As parents are bringing the children to K4C, I want to encourage you to talk to someone next to you,

362
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 maybe somebody you haven't met, just say hello, and then in a minute I'll bring us back.

363
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 So say hi to someone. Let's do that.

364
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 [Music]

365
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 [Music]

366
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 [Music]

367
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 All right, time to bring it back.

368
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Always love seeing you connect as part of being a community.

369
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Good to see each other. Good to meet new people.

370
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Hey, we have a very important January, and I actually wanted to share two things.

371
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 First, we have our annual fast as the Vine Church in Wan Chai, but also here in Yuen Long.

372
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 So one of our practices every year at the beginning of the year, we fast together as a church.

373
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And you might wonder, well, what's that about? Not everyone comes from, you know, maybe you've never been to church.

374
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 You don't know, like, what in the world is fasting.

375
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Maybe you've even been in church. You've never done it.

376
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 So I want to say a little bit about that.

377
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Fasting, we fast to draw near to God and to come into his presence and to ask for him, you know, to move powerfully.

378
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And it's also a way of expressing our dependence on God, you know, that he is the one who provides our food.

379
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 He is the one who provides spiritual direction and guidance.

380
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 He is the one that can bring breakthrough in areas where we're stuck.

381
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 And so we set aside, we abstain from something when we fast.

382
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 So usually in the Bible, it's food.

383
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 And the Bible is, you know, full food fast, 21 days.

384
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 That would be rough.

385
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 If you've never done it, I don't recommend that to start off with.

386
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 But a lot of people do the Daniel fast.

387
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 So they fast, they only eat vegetables, not meat, only drink water.

388
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 So that's one thing that a lot of people do.

389
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Another thing that people abstain from, so some people skip a meal, maybe you skip lunch or something.

390
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Others do social media, Netflix, other things.

391
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 I've done social media is hard, but I think it kind of shows you how addicted you are to it.

392
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 I did that one time and my hand kept like going to my phone.

393
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 It was like automatic, you know, and so it took me a while to stop doing that.

394
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 But it's not just about abstaining fasting because we actually want to carve our time to seek God in prayer and to spend time with God.

395
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 So what I want to encourage you, so our fasting is from January 8th to January 28th, 21 days.

396
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 I want to encourage you to ask God, how do you want me to fast and what do you want me to fast about?

397
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 You know, is there something in your life, you know, where maybe it's about your job, you know, you don't know what to do.

398
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Maybe it's about a relationship.

399
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 You need God to meet you.

400
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 I want to ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to you what to fast about.

401
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 And then we'll do that.

402
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And then at church, we're also going to be fasting for 2024 because our focus will be on loving Yuen Long in Hong Kong and really moving out of this building.

403
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 But we, as Phalake was sharing, not by might, not by power, but by the Spirit of God, by his leading, by his empowerment.

404
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 And so we're going to fast and ask God to speak to us and empower us and lead us as we go and do this in 2024.

405
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Does that sound good?

406
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Are you guys excited?

407
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Come on.

408
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Come on.

409
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Okay. Are you guys excited?

410
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Yes.

411
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 You are amazing.

412
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 So I'm excited.

413
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 So then on January the 16th, we're just connected to our fasting.

414
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 We have a prayer meeting.

415
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 It's Tuesday nights, 8 to 9.30 p.m.

416
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 If you're able to come, this will be crucial for us.

417
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 I want to encourage you, if you can come, to come on that Tuesday evening, the 16th, 8 to 9.30, put it in your calendar.

418
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 And we're going to seek God together.

419
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 We're going to pray.

420
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 We're going to share what God's been revealing and speaking to us through fasting.

421
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 So mark that in the calendar.

422
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 So we keep it quite simple in January.

423
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 But we want to dedicate this month to God and seek him as we launch into the year.

424
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Now, right now we're going to transition in a time of continuing with our worship through offering.

425
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 So right now, welcome to you.

426
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 I want to invite you to pass around the buckets.

427
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 So God has been so generous to us.

428
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Everything we have is from him.

429
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 And so part of as a follower of Jesus is that we give generously to his work, to his mission, and it honors God.

430
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 And there's also something about when we are generous with our finances, it kind of breaks the power of money being an idol in our lives.

431
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Because let's be honest, a lot of times money has a grip on our lives.

432
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 And this is also a way that God teaches us to be generous, to love others.

433
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 And so your giving helps us to carry out this mission, will help us in 2024 to love you long, and the city, and to serve them in practical ways.

434
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 So thank you so much for faithfully giving.

435
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 And also I want to note, I always forget to say this, on your seats you have envelopes.

436
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 They have all the information, different ways of how you can give, so you can take that home.

437
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 One way to really bless us is if you set up regular giving, because then we know what we're working with.

438
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 So ask God, pray about it, and then whatever he says is always the best.

439
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 But let me pray for us and for our offering.

440
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Jesus, we thank you that you are so generous to us, that everything we have is from you.

441
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Literally everything we have is from you.

442
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 And you are so good, you withhold nothing.

443
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 And we now in turn bring these gifts to you as part of our worship.

444
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 And we pray that you use them, that our giving, our offerings, that they honor you, and that you use them to love the people around us, to serve the city in practical ways, to proclaim your good news.

445
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 So we pray this in your name, Jesus.

446
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Amen. Amen.

447
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Right now I have the wonderful privilege of inviting John, Reverend Dr. John Snedecroft.

448
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 So for those of you who don't know John, and I also want to welcome Sandra, because they're a team, they always work in tandem.

449
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 And both of them have been such a blessing to me, to Chris, to Ellie, our daughter.

450
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 They're mentors of ours, and we are so, I'm so blessed by you, really.

451
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And he's been journeying with us as we've been planting this church, advising behind the scenes, and just being very supportive, and also just enjoying coming here as well.

452
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 So thank you so much, John, for that.

453
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 I want to pray for John, for us to receive what he has, so let's pray.

454
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Jesus, thank you so much for John, for his heart, for your people, for his heart, for your church, where he just pours out himself over and over for your sake, for your people's sake.

455
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 And I pray today, as he shares what he has prepared, what you have spoken to him, that you would powerfully work through that in our lives, in our hearts, and that it would be something that challenges us and encourages us.

456
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 So I pray for your anointing, your blessing, your strengthening on him right now, and I pray this in your name, Jesus.

457
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Amen.

458
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 Amen.

459
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 Let's hear it for Tim.

460
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Tim, I just feel for you that you come across, you're a big man physically, right?

461
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 But this season, God is making you into the big man spiritually.

462
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 So actually, let's not be just pulled off by just looking at him.

463
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 God is doing something inside of him, right?

464
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Might be the fasting, right?

465
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 But this is your season, and God is making you into a spiritual giant as well as a physical giant.

466
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Can I have amen to that?

467
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 Yes.

468
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Well, happy New Year to everyone.

469
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 It's great to be here.

470
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 A new year is a new opportunity.

471
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Vine Church, Yuen Long, you are about to enter into a new season.

472
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 It will not look like what you've known before.

473
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 God says, "I will do a new thing."

474
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 As someone who's had a relationship with the Vine Church for almost 30 years,

475
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 I am indeed honored and privileged to be asked to say a few words on this special day, New Year's Eve.

476
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 And may I just say right up front, what a wonderful year it's been.

477
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 From those months, those wonderful months preparing at EIS, you'll remember those forever, won't you?

478
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 It's amazing.

479
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 The prayer walks, the social events, the barbecues, the Vision Sunday, generous offering.

480
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 We're here today because on one Sunday this year, people were moved to give enough money to actually finance this church.

481
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 The official launch and this wonderful building.

482
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 Beyond any of our wildest dreams.

483
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 My first words, however, may be misconstrued as me being a bit of a killjoy.

484
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Almost, as you say, putting a dampener on this joyous occasion.

485
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 But I need to say them nonetheless.

486
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 The church is not a building.

487
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 You're allowed to say amen, by the way.

488
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 Any Pentecostals here? Yeah, good.

489
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 Church is not a building.

490
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 The church is not a building.

491
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 The word that Jesus was quoted as using that we translate as church,

492
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 ecclesia, has nothing to do with a church building.

493
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 But I think this conversation only goes to illustrate the confusion that many of us face

494
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 with church being regarded as a place, as a building we go to, rather than a thing we are.

495
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 But in a sense, it doesn't matter whether we meet in a beautiful crystal cathedral or an old scout hut.

496
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 The church is us, the people of God.

497
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 And I believe that this highly impressive building here at Ho-Shan-Li is a conduit.

498
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 A conduit for us meeting together to thank God.

499
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 To thank God for his faithfulness and goodness at the Vine for almost 30 years.

500
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 And for this amazing past year here at Yuen Long.

501
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 But equally as important is to seek him for his presence in the present.

502
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 And to ask his guidance for the future.

503
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 I believe this is one of possibly the most significant times in church history.

504
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 Give or take a percentage point, around 94% of Hong Kong's population are currently not part of any church.

505
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 Does that make you feel good? It doesn't make me feel good.

506
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 Many in our city, especially the younger generation, have lost hope.

507
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 We're seeing an increase in those suffering with mental health issues.

508
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 And an alarming rise in teenage suicides.

509
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 And in case you haven't noticed, our poor seem to be getting poorer.

510
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 What can we do?

511
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 My friends, mark my words.

512
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 This building is significant.

513
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 But not as an aquarium to keep the fish in.

514
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 But as a launching pad for the lifeboats.

515
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 Can I say that again?

516
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 A launching pad for the lifeboats.

517
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Down those stairs and out there.

518
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 I see this building as an equipping center.

519
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 Equipping the saints to man the lifeboats to be sent to the lost.

520
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 The lonely.

521
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 Those who've lost hope.

522
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 And I believe there are many fish to be caught right here in Yuen Long.

523
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 I declare today that Yuen Long is a fishing village.

524
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 An ocean full of fish ready to be caught.

525
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 As I prayed this week, I saw a picture.

526
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 I saw it in two halves.

527
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 The first half was about today.

528
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 The people of this church were gathered together.

529
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 And we were like young eaglets in an eagle's nest.

530
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 Safe together.

531
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 Nestling in the mother's arms.

532
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 They were in close community with each other.

533
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 And I think that describes the Vine Yuen Long very, very well.

534
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 You enjoy wonderful community.

535
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 But in the second scene, the eaglets had grown.

536
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 And I saw squadrons of eagles swarming out from Hong San Lee.

537
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 To the people of Yuen Long.

538
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 To the people of Hong Kong.

539
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 And beyond.

540
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 This building is to be that nurture place.

541
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 This building is to be that nurture place.

542
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 Where, oh yes, you enjoy community.

543
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 And please go on enjoying community.

544
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 But where you are also prepared, trained, equipped to be sent to where the church of Hong Kong really is.

545
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 In our offices.

546
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 In our schools.

547
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 And the housing estates of our city.

548
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 And in that respect, I want to share a verse.

549
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 It is the motivating verse for this message.

550
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 It is my prayer.

551
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 It is my dream for this church in 2024.

552
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 And I believe that this verse describes you.

553
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 The people who call Vine Yuen Long their home church.

554
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 It is Psalm 1-3.

555
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 That person, Tim.

556
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 That person, Darius.

557
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 Is like a tree.

558
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 Planted by streams of water.

559
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 Which yields its fruit in season.

560
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 And whose leaf does not wither.

561
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 Whatever they do, prospers.

562
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 Now read my lips for a moment.

563
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 There is no room in this church for spectators.

564
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 Or to be honest, any church, to be honest.

565
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 Christianity is not a spectator sport.

566
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 The Psalmist has already told us this in verse 1.

567
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 Blessed is the one who does not walk in the step with the wicked.

568
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Or stand in the way that sinners take.

569
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 Or sit in the company of mockers.

570
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 But whose delight is in the law of the Lord.

571
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 And who meditates on his law day and night.

572
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 And can I just back up what Tim said about the fast.

573
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 Fast is not about what you give up.

574
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 Fast is about what you gain.

575
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 Meditate on his word day and night.

576
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 And I will come back to blessing at the end of my talk.

577
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 But this got me thinking.

578
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 Everybody sort of wants a successful life.

579
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 Church is always talking about having successful ministries.

580
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 But what is it?

581
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 The promise of success here is qualified by the context.

582
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 Whatever they do.

583
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 And whatever they do will be determined by living in obedience to the scriptures.

584
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 Whose delight is in the law of the Lord.

585
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 Who meditates on his law day and night.

586
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 That is what will prosper.

587
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 And what I want to do now is move from.

588
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 Churches often talk about doing preaching verse by verse.

589
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 It's very popular in churches.

590
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 I'm going to move to something which I'm going to call word by word preaching.

591
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 And I want to end up with 6 definitions of success.

592
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 This is my prayer for you for 2024.

593
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 And they are all in verse 3.

594
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 And they are all linked to the sense of a tree being planted by streams of water.

595
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 And you will love this.

596
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 They all begin with the letter P.

597
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 Ironically, the world might come up with the same 6 Ps.

598
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 But I want you to see them through the lens of a tree planted by streams of water.

599
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 Through as it were Psalm 1 3 tinted glasses.

600
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 And the first P is this.

601
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 Prominence.

602
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 It says like a tree.

603
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 Trees are prominent.

604
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 To be prominent is to be widely known.

605
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 We are to project outward from the line we started in our faith.

606
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 A tree is a prominent part of nature.

607
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 And I want to say to you it is not wrong to be prominent in the world.

608
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 Billy Graham was friends with 13 US presidents.

609
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 From Harry S. Truman to Donald J. Trump.

610
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 It is time to let our faith be known.

611
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 Can I repeat that?

612
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 It is time to let our faith be known.

613
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 Always move forward.

614
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 We are to be bold like a tree.

615
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 Just like a tree is always growing, so should our faith.

616
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 You know, no one's faith can stand still.

617
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 It either goes forward or backwards.

618
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 The second P is permanence.

619
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 The word is planted here.

620
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 This quality of the Christian life is crucial.

621
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 We need to be permanently planted in God's word.

622
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 We need to be permanent with our faith and not let anything shake us.

623
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 We've been singing about that all morning.

624
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 Not let the things of the world shake us.

625
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 We are to be rooted by the word of God.

626
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 Rooted by the words of God.

627
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 That means if a decision comes up, a problem or a doubt,

628
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 we should always refer to God's word for assurance.

629
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 This permanence gives us security.

630
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 There are just too many Christians out there who float in the wind

631
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 and compromise their faith with the world.

632
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 We are to stand firm with security and permanence.

633
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Then there is position.

634
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 This is important.

635
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 It says here, planted by streams of water.

636
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 As important as it is to be planted,

637
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 we must make sure we don't plant ourselves outside in a field

638
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 that's going to be chopped down by lumber workers.

639
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 We are to plant ourselves by streams of water.

640
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 Water nourishes and feeds the tree to grow strong and permanent.

641
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 Just like the tree has water,

642
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 we need God's word and God's Holy Spirit to nourish us,

643
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 to feed us, and to counsel us.

644
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 We need God's word, but we need God's Holy Spirit.

645
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 The fourth P is productivity.

646
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 The word here is fruit.

647
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 It will bear fruit.

648
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 When a tree is healthy, drinking water, and firmly planted,

649
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 it doesn't only grow, but it bears fruit.

650
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 If we are reading and meditating on God's word,

651
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 if we are being constantly filled with the Holy Spirit,

652
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 if we are positioning ourselves in the correct area

653
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 and firmly plant ourselves, we too will bear fruit for Jesus.

654
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 By our fruit, people will be able to tell what really matters to us.

655
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 I want to ask you a question.

656
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 What is the fruit of your life?

657
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 Do you have any fruit?

658
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 Is your fruit sour or sweet?

659
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 What type of fruit is your life producing?

660
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 The fifth P is perpetuity.

661
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 It says the leaf does not wither.

662
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 We are to be in a state of being perpetual.

663
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 That is never-ending for eternity.

664
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 Our leaf does not wither.

665
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 When life gets stormy,

666
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 we had a few typhoons this year, haven't we, in Hong Kong?

667
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 T10.

668
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 What happens to you when your life gets stormy?

669
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 We need to look at trials.

670
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 We need to look at the typhoons in life as a test that will only make us stronger.

671
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 We cannot fold to harsh times and bad weather.

672
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
 The leaf of God does not wither and we are the leaf.

673
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 My friends, do not give in.

674
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:03,000
 There will be times in 2024 when every one of us will feel like giving in.

675
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 Do not give in.

676
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 My last P is prosperity.

677
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 It says whatever they do will prosper.

678
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 If we abide in God, everything we do will prosper.

679
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
 We may not always see it that way or even ever see it.

680
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:30,000
 We must choose what we want our ministry on earth to be about.

681
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:39,000
 Is it to be about us or is it to be about the generations to come?

682
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 We need to leave a legacy for Christ, not our name.

683
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 That's my 2024 challenge to you.

684
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 Who are you leaving a legacy to?

685
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 Who's coming after you?

686
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 Who are you sowing into?

687
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 I want to encourage each one of you to find someone

688
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 that you can actually regularly find time to sow into their lives.

689
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 My 2024 prayer for you is for an intellectually excellent mind.

690
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 One that is informed.

691
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 One that makes important distinctions when a less mature mind fails to do so.

692
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 One that has deeper and deeper insights into issues of importance.

693
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 Be planted by streams of water.

694
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 It's simple.

695
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
 Be planted.

696
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 Who are the people you're spending time with?

697
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 Where are you getting fed?

698
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 Be saturated in God's Word and saturated in God's Holy Spirit.

699
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 And you will be blessed.

700
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 Our church will be blessed.

701
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 Most importantly, our city will be blessed.

702
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 What I want to say as I'm moving towards a conclusion is I want to bless you.

703
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:18,000
 I want to bless you, dear church, for the past, the present, and the future.

704
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 As we come to the end of an eventful period in our history,

705
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 the last word many of us might use to describe this period is "blessing."

706
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 In fact, some other words might come to mind.

707
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:39,000
 And yet, blessing is an important aspect of our Hong Kong culture.

708
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 We see the character "fook" or "foo" everywhere,

709
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 meaning prosperity, fortune, good luck, happiness.

710
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
 It's most popular amongst the young children and the unmarried

711
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
 when we get to Lai Si time at Lunar New Year.

712
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,000
 But "fook" or "foo" can also mean "blessing."

713
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 And we as Christians use it in our vocabulary with phrases like "Yei so yuk fuk lei,"

714
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 "God bless you."

715
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 And blessing is also an important aspect of our faith life.

716
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
 It's mentioned over 400 times in Scripture.

717
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 In his song "10,000 Reasons," Matt Redmond encourages this, doesn't he?

718
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
 "Bless the Lord, O my soul, bless the Lord, O my soul,

719
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
 and all that is within me, bless His holy name," from Psalm 103.

720
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 In the New Testament, in Ephesians 1, we read,

721
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

722
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places."

723
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
 Now that's a lot of blessing.

724
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 But it leads me, very nicely, to highlight three blessings that the Bible mandates.

725
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
 I want to take them one at a time.

726
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:14,000
 The first one is this, we are to bless God.

727
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
 As Christians, we surely say, "God blesses us."

728
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
 Even in these difficult past few years,

729
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
 God's blessings greatly outnumber the trials that came with virus,

730
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 political unrest, and financial instability,

731
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 without belittling or making light of the hardship that many of us have faced.

732
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
 But what does it mean that we can bless God?

733
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,000
 If God is perfect, how can we bless Him?

734
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:55,000
 To bless God simply means to praise Him, or to honor His name.

735
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,000
 The Hebrew word translated "bless" in the Old Testament literally means to kneel,

736
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
 indicating the idea of honoring the Lord.

737
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
 We do not add anything to Him when we bless Him,

738
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:21,000
 yet we worship Him as our appropriate response to His greatness and His love for us.

739
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,000
 As we saw earlier in the Psalms, we often find verses that speak of blessing the Lord.

740
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
 Another example is found in Psalm 104, verse 1.

741
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 "Bless the Lord, O my soul." There it is again.

742
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
 "O Lord my God, You are very great.

743
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 You are clothed with honor and majesty."

744
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
 So that's the first thing, we're to bless God.

745
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:55,000
 And secondly, we are to bless each other.

746
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
 We know that we have been so greatly blessed.

747
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
 So many of us have been given so much.

748
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 Material goods, adequate incomes, families, friends, jobs, homes.

749
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 Being part of the vine year long is in itself a huge blessing.

750
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
 That's just for starters.

751
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 If you are a Christian, then whatever your circumstances,

752
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 you have been given the greatest gifts.

753
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
 Faith, hope, and love.

754
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 You have been blessed with the means of grace and hope of glory.

755
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:48,000
 If you have Christ, you have been given everything that is eternally worthwhile.

756
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 So the big question is why?

757
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
 Why have I, why have you been so blessed?

758
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
 And the answer to that question is found in Genesis 12, verses 2-3.

759
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 We call it the Abrahamic Covenant.

760
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 This is God's promise to Abraham.

761
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 God said to Abraham, now bear in mind when God said this promise to Abraham,

762
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
 Abraham was about 90 years of age, right?

763
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
 His wife was barren and he had no kids, right?

764
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
 And he said, "I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you,

765
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 and I will make your name great, so that, so that,

766
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,000
 so that you will be a blessing.

767
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,000
 I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse.

768
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:53,000
 And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."

769
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
 God was saying to Abraham and is saying to us today,

770
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,000
 "I bless you, you bless others."

771
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
 Simple.

772
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:15,000
 "I will bless you, yes, so that, so that you will bless others."

773
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
 Can I challenge you today and every day to ask God,

774
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:28,000
 "Who can I be a blessing to today?"

775
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
 A smile.

776
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
 Can we try it, by the way?

777
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
 Yeah, you can smile, good.

778
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
 A smile.

779
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
 Do you know what it can mean so much?

780
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
 A kind word.

781
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
 An act of service.

782
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
 Oh, by the way, can some people in Hong Kong start pressing the door open button

783
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
 on the lift instead of the door close button?

784
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
 That's a blessing.

785
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:01,000
 Have you noticed, right, the door close button is worn out, right?

786
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
 The door open is pristine, right?

787
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
 Nothing is on it, yeah.

788
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
 Start blessing people by holding the lift for them.

789
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
 That's a very simple one, right?

790
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:17,000
 A compassionate heart will share God's love with those who perhaps may be

791
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
 feeling overwhelmed by circumstances.

792
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
 So we are to bless God.

793
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
 We are to bless God and we are to bless each other.

794
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:35,000
 And thirdly, we are to bless our city.

795
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 There's almost an amen there.

796
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
 Good, I like it.

797
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,000
 Proverbs 11 and 11 says, "Through the blessing of the upright," that's us,

798
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:50,000
 "Through the blessing of the upright, a city will be exalted."

799
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
 Wow, stick this on your fridge.

800
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
 Hong Kong is our home.

801
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
 Its people are our family.

802
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
 If we were to begin each day with a short prayer to bless Hong Kong,

803
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
 bless its people, and oh yes, bless the Vine,

804
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
 and bless every other church in our city as well at the same time,

805
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
 I believe that we would very soon see a change in the

806
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,000
 spiritual atmosphere here.

807
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
 Dr. Ed Silvozo, a friend of mine, in his excellent book,

808
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 "Prayer Evangelism, How to Change the Spiritual Climate Over Your Home,

809
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,000
 Neighborhood, and City," lists four steps based on Jesus' instructions to

810
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
 the 72 disciples in Luke 10.

811
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
 He says this, "Number one, bless them.

812
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 Number two, fellowship with them.

813
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
 Number three, take care of their needs.

814
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:08,000
 And then at the bottom of the pile, proclaim the good news."

815
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 Step one is blessing.

816
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
 Dr. Ed describes it as speaking peace to them.

817
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:24,000
 He says, "Bless, befriend, care, share.

818
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
 Bless, befriend, care, share."

819
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
 How often do churches do it the other way around?

820
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:38,000
 We organize programs, courses, activities,

821
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:45,000
 where we should start by blessing.

822
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
 So let's begin today.

823
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:56,000
 I want to finish by praying a priestly blessing upon you.

824
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,000
 It's called an Aaronic blessing, after Aaron, from the book of Numbers.

825
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,000
 And we sang the song earlier, inspired Carrie Jobe and Cody Cairns to write

826
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
 the song "Blessing," that has been sung all around the world in many languages.

827
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
 In fact, at the first service, we sang it in Cantonese.

828
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
 We're going to sing it again in a few minutes.

829
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:25,000
 And I invite the band to come back and you to stand, please.

830
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
 I want to give you the reference point.

831
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
 It comes from Numbers 6, 24 to 26.

832
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
 It says, "The Lord bless you and keep you.

833
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:41,000
 The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.

834
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:49,000
 The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace."

835
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 You might remember at the beginning of the sermon, I started a little bit

836
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
 controversially by talking about the church building.

837
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
 And I'm going to finish on a similar controversial vein.

838
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:08,000
 I love this song, but whenever I hear it sung in church, we always sing it wrong.

839
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:18,000
 I see congregation members with their eyes closed, maybe their arms raised,

840
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
 singing to God.

841
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
 This is not meant to be sung to God.

842
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
 We are meant to be singing this to each other.

843
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
 It is not, "Bless the Lord, O my soul."

844
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
 We might do that afterwards.

845
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
 So what I'm proposing, in line with my three points, all good sermons have

846
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
 three points, is this.

847
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:53,000
 In a moment, we're going to pray a prayer to bless God.

848
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
 It's right to do that.

849
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:02,000
 Then as we sing the verse, "The Lord bless you," "The Lord bless you,"

850
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
 I'm going to suggest we just sing it to each other.

851
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,000
 Ivan, "The Lord bless you and keep you."

852
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
 We sing it to each other.

853
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
 Now this is a little bit strange, you know, particularly those that are

854
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
 Englishmen, you know, don't like this sort of thing.

855
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
 "The Lord bless you."

856
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
 We're going to sing this to each other.

857
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
 We're going to rejoice in this as we sing it to each other.

858
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
 In 2024, we're going into a new year, and we're singing over each other,

859
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
 "Lord bless you and keep you."

860
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:40,000
 For the second time we sing it, we're going to face the outside world.

861
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
 We're going to face Yuen Long.

862
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
 For one easy way, we go there.

863
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
 I know Yuen Long is that way and that way, but we've got stairs here.

864
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
 And we're going to sing out over Yuen Long.

865
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
 "Yuen Long, the Lord bless you."

866
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
 Yeah, we're going to do it.

867
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
 We're going to sing over our beloved city.

868
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
 But the time you get to the amens, and there's loads of those,

869
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
 anything might be happening.

870
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
 But what we're going to do is this.

871
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
 We're going to bless God.

872
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
 We're going to bless each other.

873
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
 And we're going to bless our city.

874
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
 Can I hear amen to that?

875
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
 That was three of you.

876
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
 Let's try it again.

877
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
 Can I hear amen?

878
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
 Let's pray.

879
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
 Now this is the bit you can close your eyes for.

880
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
 I'm just telling you.

881
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
 You haven't got to look at anyone else.

882
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
 Dear God, we bless your holy name today.

883
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
 Thank you for your goodness.

884
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
 Thank you for your crown of steadfast love and mercy.

885
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
 We recognize all that you have done for us as a church

886
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
 and for every church in this city.

887
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,000
 And all that you continue to do now and all that you will do in the future.

888
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

889
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
 Bless you.

890
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
 Let's get ready to sing to each other.

891
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
 Wow.

892
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
 Ready, here we go.

 [music]

904
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
 Sing this over you and love, over Hong Kong.

905
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
 Are you ready?

906
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
 Lord bless you and keep you.

907
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
 Get ready.

908
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
 This is important.

909
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000

913
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
 Okay, sing it over in Cantonese.

914
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
 We're going to sing this in Cantonese, right?

915
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
 You lead us.

916
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:30,000

01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:46,000
 [music]

918
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
 And in one voice we sing amen.

919
01:12:48,000 --> 01:13:12,000
 [music]

920
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
 Now let's sing over each other and over the city.

921
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
 May his favor be upon you to a thousand generations.

922
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
 To your children and your children and their children and their children.

923
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
 Let's sing it over each other.

924
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
 Let's sing it over our city.

925
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
 Let's sing it over Hong Kong.

926
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
 Let's sing it over China, over Asia, to the end of the earth.

927
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:53,000

928

929
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
 Let's sing may his favor.

 [music]

931
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
 In the morning.

932
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
 In the evening.

933
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
 In your coming.

934
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
 In your going.

935
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
 In your weeping.

936
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
 Rejoicing.

937
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
 He is for you.

938
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
 He is for you.

939
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
 He is for you.

940
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
 He is for you.

941
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
 He is for you.

942
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
 He is for you.

943
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
 He is for you.

944
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
 He is for you.

945
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
 Yeah.

946
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
 Amen, amen.

947
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:26,000
 [music]

948
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
 This is one I think you all know together.

949
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
 We're going to sing this and bring it all together.

950
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
 We're going to bless the Lord and everything that's within us.

951
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
 Praise his holy name.

952
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:51,000
 [music]

953
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
 We'll get right to it.

01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:01,000
 [music]

955
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
 Bless the Lord.

 [music]

957
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
 This is where you can lift your hands, guys.

 [music]

980
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
 Keep your hands raised.

981
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
 We're going to pray.

982
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:14,000
 We're going to ask God just to pour out his Holy Spirit on us for 2024.

983
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
 We're asking God to fill you with Spirit so you can feel good,

984
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
 so you can have tingles down your spine.

985
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:30,000
 But God needs to fill you with the Holy Spirit for the people out there, for the '94.

986
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
 You say to me, "Pastor, I was filled with the Holy Spirit 10 years ago."

987
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
 I say, "I'm not interested."

988
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
 Are you being filled with the Holy Spirit today?

989
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:50,000
 Because the people of Hong Kong, the people of Yuen Long, need a church where its people meditate on the Word of the God day and night,

990
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:58,000
 are steeped in the Word of God, and are filled with his Spirit.

991
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
 I'm going to pray a prayer now that's in the Anglican prayer book.

992
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
 I've not found anything better.

993
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:14,000
 Father God, fill us up with your Holy Spirit, and send us out to live and work to your praise and glory.

994
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:27,000
 Fill us up, Lord, and send us out to live and work for your praise and for your glory.

995
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,000
 Let's just spend a minute just waiting on God, equipping.

996
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
 You mentioned that word. This place is an equipping center.

997
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
 This place is a launch pad for the lifeboats.

998
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:48,000
 The fish are out there.

999
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:55,000
 There's an ocean of fish waiting to be caught.

1000
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:13,000
 Fill us up and send us out. Fill us up, Lord.

1001
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
 Thank you, Holy Spirit, for filling us.

1002
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,000
 But you, Holy Spirit, you are who leads us in this mission.

1003
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:34,000
 You're the only one who empowers us for this mission of being a blessing, of befriending, of caring, and of sharing with those around us.

1004
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:43,000
 So may this not just be words, Lord, but may you in 2024 help us to live this out and put us in action, Lord.

1005
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
 That's our heart's cry. That's our heart's cry.

1006
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:57,000
 We want to be a church that just talks, one a church that really loves people, one a church that goes out and serves, that blesses,

1007
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:07,000
 that doesn't do it the wrong way around, as we heard today, that does it the right way around at first, blesses, befriends, cares, shares.

1008
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:18,000
 So we pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Amen.

1009
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:26,000
 Thank you, John, for a powerful word, for blessing us. Let's give John and Jesus a big hand.

1010
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
 Jesus and John. Yeah.

1011
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:35,000
 Thank you, worship team, for being flexible, for doing things you didn't know you were going to be doing.

1012
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:43,000
 Right now, we also want to ask Chapman to actually come up, because we're a community, we're family.

1013
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:51,000
 This guy here is family, and he had a birthday yesterday.

1014
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:58,000
 So I want to ask if he could help me sing "Happy Birthday," all right?

1015
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:14,000
 Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Chapman.

1016
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:24,000
 Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Chapman.

1017
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:31,000
 Yes. Well, we love and appreciate you, all that you do. We love having your family here.

1018
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
 And so what a blessing you are to us. Thank you so much.

1019
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:43,000
 Hey, have an incredible happy new year, knowing that God is with you, regardless, you know, what's going on.

1020
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:52,000
 He is, He will carry us through the storm, and He will also help us carry out this beautiful vision of blessing the people around us.

1021
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:00,000
 Also, since John talked so much about blessing, we have bless magnets as a reminder that we start with blessing.

1022
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:07,000
 So you can pick up a bless magnet, you can put it on your fridge, so you can remember, we want to start with blessing people.

1023
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:13,000
 Also, if you want prayer, you know, maybe this year hasn't been easy.

1024
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
 Maybe there's something you don't know about 2024, there's something you're going through.

1025
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:22,000
 Maybe you just want somebody to pray over you. Whatever the reason, the prayer team would love to pray with you.

1026
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,000
 They're here on your right-hand side, Benedict and Hannah, I believe, and Eva.

1027
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
 So do take advantage of that. Parents, now is the time to pick up your children.
