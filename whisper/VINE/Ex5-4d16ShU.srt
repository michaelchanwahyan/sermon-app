1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 So, I'm sure you would agree with me that there have been some pretty incredible inventions

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,880
 over the years, the centuries, right, that really have transformed and revolutionized

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,800
 how we do things, even the simple things, you know, like a light bulb.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,680
 Could you imagine if we didn't have a light bulb?

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,680
 Electricity.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,440
 Even an umbrella.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,680
 Who was thankful for the invention of an umbrella today?

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,440
 The World Wide Web Internet as we know it.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,680
 I mean, sometimes we may not be thankful, but I think the majority of us would say technology

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,720
 has advanced at incredible paces, and if you're watching online, you get to benefit with that

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,520
 as well today.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:57,600
 Well, one of my favorite inventions has to be the Kindle.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,920
 I love the Kindle.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,000
 Now I know all of you book lovers out there, you know, the ones that like to touch and

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,120
 feel and smell the pages.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,160
 Yes, yes, I know, we're getting nods here.

17
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,360
 Heather Rose, I know you're watching online.

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,560
 I know you love your books as well.

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,840
 Well, I love the books, the Kindles, especially living in Hong Kong, because you know what

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,920
 it's like if we have too many books?

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,480
 Where do we put them?

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,080
 So with a Kindle, you can have hundreds of books, and you do not have to worry about

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,320
 storage, right?

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:43,320
 I love my Kindle because I love reading, and I love stories, and stories can be powerful

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,000
 tools that really do shape how we think and how we view the world.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,200
 Think of your favorite movie or book.

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,000
 When you're immersed in that book or that movie, and you are so engrossed with what's

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,120
 happening, you have no idea what's happening outside of that book or that movie, and your

29
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,840
 brain is telling you that you are part of that story.

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,840
 Well, there is a term for this.

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,520
 It's called narrative transportation theory.

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,240
 Did you know that?

33
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
 It's true.

34
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,120
 It's amazing what you learn here in church.

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,920
 Narrative transportation theory, seriously.

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:35,400
 This suggests that the power of stories can actually change attitudes and intentions that

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,000
 are reflected in the story.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,360
 I am 100% convinced this is true.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:53,960
 When I watch Tomb Raider, I am Lara Croft, and I am abseiling down the IFC.

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,120
 Now if you've never watched Tomb Raider, you have no idea what I'm talking about, but the

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:06,420
 point is in our 21st century, with social media, we know that stories impact us.

42
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,760
 It can be negative, and it can be positive.

43
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,600
 I love that Jesus was way ahead of all the philosophers and the psychologists of the

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:27,000
 past and the influencers of the present in understanding how stories draw listeners in.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,320
 They influence thoughts, feelings, and behavior.

46
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:41,680
 As we come to the end of our series on parables, we have seen how Jesus used stories to disrupt,

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,260
 to challenge, and inspire.

48
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,580
 Jesus was not just a great storyteller.

49
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:58,160
 Jesus intentionally provoked the imagination of his audience to dismantle their views of

50
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:07,420
 the world, in particular its value system, so that the true nature of God's world would

51
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,620
 be revealed, and that would inspire change.

52
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,740
 Jesus knew that the people that gathered around him, those that loved him, those that hated

53
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:26,500
 him, and those that weren't quite sure what they thought about him, were far more likely

54
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:33,620
 to be challenged to look at the world differently when they heard parables, stories that they

55
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:40,800
 could help see the world, force them to think, make choices.

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:49,820
 Do they embrace this new upside-down value system, or do they ignore it and just continue

57
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:55,980
 with life as they have always done and face the consequences?

58
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,380
 And this week, we are looking at the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, found in the

59
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,380
 Gospel of Luke.

60
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:11,440
 So as we open up God's word, as we listen to Jesus' words, let's also be willing to

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:20,520
 dismantle our own worldviews, challenge some of our behaviors, so that we are inspired

62
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,400
 to live a kingdom lifestyle.

63
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,960
 And as I read through Luke now, I want to invoke your imagination.

64
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,260
 We're going to do that through words and art.

65
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:40,680
 And so as I read, you will see various artistic interpretations of this parable presented

66
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,580
 over the centuries.

67
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:53,040
 So sit back, look, and listen.

68
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:00,000
 There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,560
 At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores, longing to eat what fell

70
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,860
 from the rich man's table.

71
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,920
 Even the dogs came and licked his sores.

72
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,500
 The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side.

73
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,360
 The rich man also died and was buried in Hades, where he was in torment.

74
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,560
 He looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side.

75
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,160
 So he called to him, "Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip

76
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,460
 of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire."

77
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,360
 But Abraham replied, "Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things

78
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,800
 while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.

79
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,360
 And besides all this, between us and you, a great chasm has been set in place, so that

80
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:03,440
 those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us."

81
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,920
 He answered, "Then I beg you, Father, send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers.

82
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,940
 Let him warn them so that they will not also come to this place of torment."

83
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,400
 Abraham replied, "They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen to them."

84
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,880
 "No, Father Abraham," he said, "but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent."

85
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:33,600
 He said to them, "If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced,

86
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:43,180
 even if someone rises from the dead."

87
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:50,220
 So what was Jesus trying to convey to the audience of his day?

88
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:56,100
 From the previous verses, we can assume that Jesus is addressing the parable to his disciples

89
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,400
 and to the Pharisees, who had earlier been sneering at Jesus when Jesus was teaching

90
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,660
 the disciples that you cannot love God and money.

91
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:14,580
 And as Jesus begins this parable, we know, or we can just imagine, how annoyed the Pharisees

92
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,060
 were beginning to be with Jesus.

93
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,340
 There are two main characters that Jesus introduces at the start, the rich man and Lazarus.

94
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,640
 And we have vivid descriptions that leave the listeners in no doubt that we have someone

95
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:37,140
 very wealthy who's living a life of luxury and indulgence in contrast to a man named

96
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,740
 Lazarus, who is living in inhumane misery.

97
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,180
 Even the dogs are mistreating him.

98
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:53,980
 He's destitute, isolated, alone, hungry, physically and emotionally suffering.

99
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:01,720
 Now interestingly, this is the only parable where Jesus actually names one of his characters.

100
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,960
 And scholars debate various different reasons why Jesus does this.

101
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:14,720
 But what it does show is how significant this suffering man was to God.

102
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,980
 Calling someone by their name is very personal.

103
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,240
 It invokes a connection to that person.

104
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:29,120
 And here, our pearl man is named Lazarus, which actually means God helps, and which

105
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,080
 we see as being prophetic as the story unfolds.

106
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,600
 This is an important reminder to us today.

107
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:50,120
 And it should be a comfort in a world where it is easy to feel nameless and unknown, forgotten,

108
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,960
 unseen.

109
00:09:51,960 --> 00:10:00,320
 God does know us, he does see us, and he calls us by name.

110
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,120
 Some of you are here today, and maybe immediately you identify with Lazarus.

111
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,600
 You too are suffering in your own ways.

112
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,440
 You don't feel seen.

113
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,560
 You don't feel heard.

114
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
 You don't feel known.

115
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:23,200
 You have huge needs that are crushing you at times, needs that you share and needs that

116
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,240
 you hold, and only you know the weight of them.

117
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:37,240
 Well, my prayer for you today is as we unfold this story together, that while you're here,

118
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,920
 you would experience the Holy Spirit ministering very personally to you.

119
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,520
 Because as I stand here and I look out at lots of different faces, God looks out and

120
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,640
 he sees every one of you and knows you by name.

121
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:03,160
 May God minister to you personally, and may you leave here being known, being seen, being

122
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,960
 loved, and with hope.

123
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:16,920
 Jesus makes this contrast with a nameless rich man who doesn't invoke any sympathy.

124
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,600
 And even though Lazarus is on the doorstep of the rich man, he's lying right in front

125
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,440
 of him, there is no excuse for not knowing that this Lazarus is there.

126
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:37,000
 But the rich man is portrayed as doing nothing, simply living his life his way every day.

127
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,160
 And then as the story unfolds, we see a dramatic switch in their circumstances, which happens

128
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,600
 when they both die.

129
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,840
 Death comes to us all.

130
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,840
 This would have been a reminder to everyone, it's a reminder for us today, regardless whether

131
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,280
 you're rich, you're poor, whether you obey the law, you don't obey the law, whether you're

132
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:10,320
 a good person or whether you're a bad person, nobody can escape death.

133
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,240
 There is no escaping death, and there's no escaping judgment after death.

134
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,880
 But there is also hope, and that's what we see in Lazarus.

135
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:30,120
 Hope also for us as believers in Jesus that despite the challenges that we face now, despite

136
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:40,280
 the pain or the suffering that we endure, we will know hope, we will know comfort.

137
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,440
 Now Jesus is drawing on the ancient Jewish teachings of that day, which for sure the

138
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,820
 Pharisees would have been very familiar with.

139
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:57,000
 He introduces his listeners into the afterlife, the concept of paradise and hell, which in

140
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,840
 the Greek is referred to by Luke as Hades.

141
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:07,280
 It's strong imagery, would have been very familiar, very familiar to the Jewish people

142
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:15,240
 of Jesus' day, which paints that picture of this great patriarchal figure of Abraham comforting

143
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,760
 and blessing Lazarus while the rich man is suffering and in great torment.

144
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,760
 And again, the power in Jesus' storytelling is that it was relatable to his audience,

145
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:36,800
 its familiar language, its culture, and its beliefs that were prevalent at their time.

146
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,960
 The Pharisees believed in a bodily resurrection with life after death, where good deeds were

147
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,240
 rewarded and bad deeds punished.

148
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:54,200
 So they would have had no problem accepting that Abraham was in paradise, welcoming the

149
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,660
 righteous.

150
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,760
 No doubt the Pharisees though, living with an assumed presumption that they were all

151
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,080
 going to go to paradise one day.

152
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:13,800
 But as Jesus depicts in this particular parable, the one rewarded here and the one punished

153
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:21,600
 portrays a very different value system, which would have challenged his listeners.

154
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,160
 You see, what is interesting is that the rich man is not portrayed as having committed a

155
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,000
 particular sin.

156
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,620
 Doesn't look like he actually did anything wrong.

157
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,640
 Having money, being blessed with material wealth is not a sin.

158
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,360
 Jesus never said it was.

159
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,040
 Rather it is how we live with what we have.

160
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:56,760
 And in this case, it is the rich man's inaction and selfish living for himself that Jesus

161
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,120
 is calling out.

162
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,640
 Jesus is not condemning him for being rich.

163
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,760
 This is not a parable against those that have plenty.

164
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,960
 But Jesus' story was showing in the kingdom of God of which Jesus was there to proclaim,

165
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:21,520
 the poor and the suffering would be comforted and be rewarded as righteous and those that

166
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,460
 lived for themselves would be held to account.

167
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:34,080
 Not only is Jesus highlighting the lack of action by the rich man, he also portrays the

168
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,720
 rich man's arrogance.

169
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,320
 This is arrogant attitude.

170
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,160
 It continues right after his death.

171
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:50,440
 His language may be respectful to Father Abraham, but he has this expectation that Lazarus should

172
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,920
 come and serve him.

173
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,860
 It's almost demonstrating this sense of entitlement.

174
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:04,040
 There is this assumption by the rich man that Lazarus should leave his place of blessing

175
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:11,520
 by Abraham's side and go over and join him to alleviate his suffering.

176
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,720
 And Abraham's response to this is basically, "No."

177
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,020
 He points out a very different set of values, very different set of values and a sense of

178
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,800
 justice.

179
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:30,260
 After all, the rich man had already received all his good things on earth as Abraham had

180
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,100
 told him.

181
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,580
 And only then do we see a glimpse of the rich man thinking of others as he pleads on behalf

182
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,100
 of his brothers.

183
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,720
 But again, the response from Abraham implies that the rich man neglected scripture, its

184
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:54,680
 teachings, and even a miracle of somebody rising from the dead would make no difference.

185
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,760
 I cannot help but imagine how the readers of the Gospel of Luke would have made that

186
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:06,880
 connection right at the early church between Jesus' own resurrection and how true his words

187
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:17,360
 would be in their context when even after Jesus rose again, so many refused to believe.

188
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,560
 The kingdom of God was at the heart of Jesus' teaching.

189
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:27,880
 Not only did his parables focus on helping people to understand how the kingdom functioned,

190
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:34,840
 but he also challenged people to change their behaviors when seeking his kingdom.

191
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,240
 The Pharisees, many, many of the religious leaders of Jesus' day, they focused heavily

192
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,060
 on the law, or they appeared to do so.

193
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:52,540
 But they neglected the spirit behind God's law, the heart of God.

194
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,160
 They ignored the real needs of the people around them, and Jesus would not tolerate

195
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
 that.

196
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,880
 Jesus was so confrontational to the religious leaders at his time.

197
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,680
 You just need to read Matthew 23.

198
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,840
 I love Matthew 23.

199
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:19,360
 Jesus absolutely slams the religious leaders of his time.

200
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:27,640
 They represented the antithesis of who God is, his heart for the poor and the vulnerable.

201
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:36,480
 The Pharisees themselves played needless burdens on the people, and Jesus called them proud,

202
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:44,760
 boastful, show-offs, blind fools, pretenders, a brood of snipers.

203
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,320
 The list just goes on.

204
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:53,640
 In the kingdom of God, the poor, the suffering, the downcast, the oppressed are not unknown

205
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,920
 by God.

206
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,360
 They will be blessed.

207
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,240
 Never think that God is not aware or concerned with those living in poverty, those that are

208
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,480
 vulnerable, those that are suffering or oppressed.

209
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,520
 Scripture's very clear how much God is on the side of the vulnerable and speaks again

210
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,120
 and again for the justice for the marginalized and comfort to those who are in pain.

211
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,720
 And that is a comfort to us.

212
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,960
 The disciples were also present listening to this story, and I wonder what went through

213
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
 their minds.

214
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,760
 Did they relate to Lazarus and his suffering?

215
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,480
 Some of them would have had to have left their own material comforts as they followed Jesus,

216
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,880
 suffered their own hardship and persecution along the way.

217
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,520
 But they would have witnessed time and time again of Jesus modeling to them what it means

218
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,880
 to reach out and care for the poor, for the suffering.

219
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:07,160
 Jesus didn't ignore it, and his disciples could not either, and neither should we.

220
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:14,720
 Jesus spoke parables to teach about God's world that was in the present and in the future.

221
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:22,000
 And he lived out this new world by healing the sick, setting the oppressed free, caring

222
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,800
 for the poor, speaking up for the marginalized.

223
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,400
 And the disciples were in the midst of seeing the kingdom of God at work in real time with

224
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:40,800
 Jesus, and they were challenged also to make their own choices in how they responded in

225
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,000
 their own actions and attitudes.

226
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,280
 Those hearing this parable would have understood it to mean inaction and indifference to the

227
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,640
 poor and suffering were not acceptable in the kingdom of God.

228
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,840
 Never has been, and never will be.

229
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,580
 So what does this actually mean for us?

230
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,280
 How does this parable reshape our worldviews?

231
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,160
 How does it challenge us?

232
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:20,120
 How does it inspire us to live proactively with kingdom values, and maybe sometimes those

233
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,120
 values that are countercultural?

234
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:32,880
 I think for many of us, we do respond practically to help the poor and the marginalized.

235
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,880
 We use our resources in various ways, whether it's our time, our finances, our skill set.

236
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,320
 And I know many of you here are very generous.

237
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,800
 I just heard recently that there are a group of you that every Monday you're cooking on

238
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,720
 the first floor in our kitchen, preparing food, and then you're going out and you're

239
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
 feeding the homeless.

240
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,920
 And you've been doing that for years.

241
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:07,920
 I know that many of you work for NGOs or are in professions that care for others, that

242
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:15,600
 require you to advocate daily for those that maybe are of a lesser social status.

243
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,400
 There are many of you here that are providing extra support to the poor and the marginalized.

244
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,820
 And some of you are in positions of power, of influence, and you are choosing to make

245
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:34,400
 a difference, to use your resources to help others.

246
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,520
 You will hear us preach and teach from the front about the importance of social justice,

247
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:46,320
 about how it's important to treat each other respectfully and fairly.

248
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:53,320
 We will even call each other out when we've witnessed or seen some behaviors that don't

249
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,600
 treat people fairly, and we've spoken about those from the front as well.

250
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,440
 And that's all good.

251
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,760
 And let's keep doing good.

252
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,560
 And let's keep using our resources and making a difference and being a light in this city.

253
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:19,620
 But what I want to ask us is a question around how easily it is for our attitudes to subtly

254
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:27,200
 change which actually will affect our response and our relationship to those in need and

255
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,080
 our relationship to God.

256
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,000
 And we need to be on guard of those so we don't find ourselves suddenly acting like

257
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,680
 the rich man.

258
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:45,360
 I think the first attitude that we need to watch out for is this indifference.

259
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,520
 Indifference can come subtly towards us.

260
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,480
 We see it in this parable, even though the needs of Lazarus are very clearly in front

261
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,840
 of the rich man every single day, the rich man ignores him.

262
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:07,140
 And I think it can creep into our own lives without realizing it as our hearts can suddenly

263
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,060
 become a little bit hard.

264
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,120
 The reality is the world has a lot of needs.

265
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,880
 It can feel overwhelming at times.

266
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:25,280
 Many years ago, my husband and I, we set up a charity that was involved in working with

267
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,120
 a country that was facing huge economic collapse.

268
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,600
 We were specifically working with abandoned children.

269
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 We were newly married.

270
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,720
 And honestly, there was a lot of sacrifice that went into setting this up, traveling,

271
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,880
 and not just the time but the money as well.

272
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:55,480
 And after a while, the demands, the constant demands that we, that I felt, started to get

273
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,520
 to me.

274
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,640
 And it wasn't until after a few years that I realized that actually I had become a little

275
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:11,640
 bit indifferent to those immediate needs around me, and that a sense of hardened heart had

276
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,520
 crept in.

277
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:22,560
 And I knew that because I found that I had this subconscious attitude of, "I've done

278
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,440
 enough.

279
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,720
 I've done a lot.

280
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,840
 I'm tired.

281
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,280
 I've done enough."

282
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,400
 Of course, I wouldn't say it, but I realized that that was something that was very real

283
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
 in my life.

284
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,000
 And it was only when I actually went to God and said, "You know what, God?

285
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,240
 I need you to break my heart for what breaks yours."

286
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:58,720
 And as Christians, I think that's something that we have got to regularly be asking ourself

287
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,480
 and praying.

288
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,680
 It's not enough to do it just because it's the right thing to do.

289
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:14,600
 But if we could regularly ask God, "God, break my heart for what breaks yours," then that

290
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:23,520
 would keep our hearts soft and that attitude of indifference away.

291
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,000
 The second attitude to be mindful of is entitlement.

292
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,360
 Oh, yes, it's a subtle one as well.

293
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:38,440
 And I'm sure at various times in our lives, we have had that sense of entitlement where

294
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,260
 you think you deserve special treatment.

295
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,840
 Maybe it's, "I've studied really, really hard and I've gone to a great university and therefore

296
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,360
 I deserve to have that better job with more benefits."

297
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:58,000
 Or maybe it's a case of, "Well, actually, I come from a first world country and therefore

298
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,680
 I'm a lot more knowledge educated than maybe somebody else."

299
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:17,760
 Maybe it's, "I don't have enough and you have a lot and so therefore you should help me."

300
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,920
 You see, entitlement has many different levels, but it does creep in.

301
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,360
 The rich man's sense of entitlement, that was clear, seen in his expectation even after

302
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,880
 death when he thought Lazarus should go over and serve him.

303
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:42,040
 There was no awareness that he had done anything wrong, but rather excuse after excuse.

304
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:49,800
 But in contrast, we see Lazarus who actually doesn't say a word throughout the whole parable.

305
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,900
 He doesn't complain about his life.

306
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,160
 He doesn't complain or express any resentment with the rich man.

307
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:04,920
 There's no gloating or suffering now that the rich man is in a different position.

308
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,880
 I'm not sure I would be so gracious.

309
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,920
 So we need to check our hearts.

310
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:18,560
 We need to check our hearts for that entitlement and we need to have that humility where we

311
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:27,760
 recognize that actually all that we have is given by God and that everything belongs to

312
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
 God.

313
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,600
 And that humility keeps us in an attitude where we are constantly again reflecting and

314
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:42,720
 choosing to follow God's ways, have his heart so that that's the attitude that we're responding

315
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,280
 to others with.

316
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:54,120
 But imagine in the city of Hong Kong or the place where you're residing now, if we as

317
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:00,640
 followers of Jesus decided to adopt the kingdom principles, which saw us acting in generous

318
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,880
 ways, kindness and compassion to everyone around us.

319
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,200
 Recently the Hong Kong tourism board launched a new campaign to encourage people to be more

320
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,560
 hospitable to each other, especially the tourists, right?

321
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,160
 I don't know why, but apparently we as Hong Kongers can be rather unfriendly and rude.

322
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,920
 I don't think that's true.

323
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:31,240
 But anyway, I actually think it came from this kindness movement that Singapore launched

324
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,840
 a number of years ago.

325
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,280
 They also said that they would like their people to be encouraged to be kinder to each

326
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:43,120
 other, especially to the tourists.

327
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,880
 We live in such a transactional world.

328
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,240
 Let's be kind because then more people will like us, then they will spend more money and

329
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,120
 that will help our economy grow.

330
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,880
 The world that Jesus spoke about was the opposite.

331
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,640
 This is not how the kingdom of God operates.

332
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,120
 This is not how we should approach our relationship to the poor or those in need.

333
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:17,840
 Rather when we realize we do not deserve anything and yet God gave everything, that should want

334
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:27,720
 us to respond in generosity towards each other for no expected return.

335
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:38,440
 Whether we have plenty, whether we have less, we are all able to lead this city and show

336
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,280
 as we represent God's way.

337
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,400
 And how can we practically respond to this message?

338
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,640
 What does it actually look like when we leave this place?

339
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,920
 Well back in Easter, my family and I, we went to Taiwan.

340
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,640
 We had a couple of days in Taiwan.

341
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,840
 And we were in this particular place one day where we had been dropped off and we were

342
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,320
 looking around a village and we had to then get back to the car that was picking us up

343
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
 at a certain time.

344
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,840
 It was a really, really hot day and part of getting back to the car involved walking up

345
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,960
 a very, very, very, very steep hill.

346
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,400
 It probably is about a 10 minute walk up.

347
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,440
 And as I say it was very, very hot and it was also busy.

348
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,840
 There was a lot of people around.

349
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,040
 And I'm there with my son.

350
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,680
 My son is 16.

351
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,000
 And we're walking up on a time, we've got to get to the car.

352
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,320
 And I'm saying to myself, "Oh, I'm so hot, so hot.

353
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,600
 Come on, we've got to get there, got to get there."

354
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,000
 And in front of us, there is this grandma.

355
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,240
 She must have been like late 70s, early 80s.

356
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,680
 And she's pushing a push chair with a four-year-old in it.

357
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,960
 And she's like pushing it up the hill like this.

358
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:08,760
 And it's hot and I'm looking at her thinking, "Oh, no, this must be really hard for her.

359
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,280
 She's got to push that child all the way up the hill."

360
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,680
 That's what I'm thinking.

361
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,680
 My son, my son is tall and strong.

362
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
 He walks in front.

363
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:28,600
 As he's walking, he looks and with his hand, he grabs the front of the push chair and he

364
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,600
 starts to pull the push chair up the hill.

365
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,760
 And the grandma is like, "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you so much."

366
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,360
 And the toddler is so excited.

367
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,640
 And you know, I watched my son and I thought, "Wow."

368
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:56,160
 I was in the same situation and my response was, "Oh, that's going to be tough for her."

369
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,200
 My son's response was action.

370
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,160
 And afterwards when I said to him, "How did you even think about doing that?"

371
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,800
 I was like, "I'm so proud of you."

372
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,360
 And he was like, "Hmm."

373
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:24,280
 And that is how we make a difference in Hong Kong, where we choose to see the people around

374
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:33,240
 us and where we choose to act differently, where we choose to allow what God has done

375
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:44,600
 for us to propel us in many different small and large ways where we can make a difference.

376
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,180
 We all are known and loved by God.

377
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,440
 The sacrifice on the cross is evidence.

378
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,600
 It is evidence that God loves us all.

379
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:05,720
 The desire for him to be in relationship with us should propel us to love others as he asked

380
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,560
 us to do.

381
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:15,240
 So I leave you today with a very simple question and challenge.

382
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,300
 Who is on your doorstep?

383
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,680
 And what are you going to do for them?

384
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:30,640
 Would you stand with me as I pray for us?

385
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:38,280
 And as we enter into a time of response, the song "Chosen" I believe is a prophetic word

386
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:48,960
 for us to sing because it talks about having God fill our hearts so that we will lead out

387
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,320
 of God's love and that we would see those around us and respond out of love to those

388
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,500
 around us.

389
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:04,680
 May this message not just be, "Well, that was a nice message," or not, whatever.

390
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:14,100
 May this message with the power of the Holy Spirit transform us as a church.

391
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:22,780
 May we the vine be known for our good deeds, our kindness, our generosity, not because

392
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:29,900
 it's a good thing to do, but because of the power of the Holy Spirit working through us,

393
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,100
 that transforms a city.

394
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:45,320
 So Father, as we stand here now, as we ask for your Spirit to empower us to live a life

395
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:52,860
 where we can bring change, where we can be countercultural at times, where we embrace

396
00:35:52,860 --> 00:36:01,660
 the value system of the kingdom of God, I pray for the Lazaruses in this room right

397
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,900
 now who don't feel known, but they are known.

398
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,660
 And I speak that over you, are known.

399
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,620
 God knows your situation.

400
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,200
 He knows exactly what you need.

401
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,460
 And I pray that you would be filled with the comfort and the presence of the peace of God

402
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:26,960
 as you leave this place knowing that you are seen by God.

403
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,460
 I pray for our young people.

404
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,620
 I thank you that they are a witness to us.

405
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:42,820
 And I pray that you empower our young people to see the needs around them and to simply

406
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:51,160
 show and lead the way of what it means to love and care and be kind to others.

407
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,420
 May we learn from them.

408
00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:02,060
 For us, Father, as we leave, as we look at who you have placed on the doorstep in front

409
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:09,740
 of us, may we not walk by, but may we take action.

410
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:15,060
 And may you break our heart for what breaks yours.

411
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,820
 We pray all of this in your name, Jesus.
