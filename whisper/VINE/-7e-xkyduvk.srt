1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 So good to see everyone. Also want to say hi to the people online.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 I know some of you are watching there. Always good to have you as well.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 I was praying for us before the service. I felt led to pray.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And a lot of times when the Holy Spirit is working in me, then there's tears.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 So when you see me crying here, then it's usually because of the Holy Spirit.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 And as I was praying, I just had the sense that everyone here was caring a lot.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 That you all have a lot going on in your lives.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 And that we've been really busy. That we've just been really busy as a church.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 But then part of that is that we've also been, to one degree or another,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 there's been some disconnecting with Jesus.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Where we're just not in that intimacy that Jesus desires for us,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 that probably we ourselves also desire.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And so it was really stirred to pray for us.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And then as we were worshipping and sang that song, "God of Revival",

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I was like, "That's it."

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 God wants to do a revival in our hearts through the Holy Spirit.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 He wants to draw us back into relationship and do something new,

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 something powerful, something beautiful in our lives.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 But that's us yielding ourselves to Jesus.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 That's not something that any speaker can push or force.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 It's really just the Holy Spirit moving in us, just saying,

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 "Lord, we want more of you. We desire you. We hunger for more of you in our lives."

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 So I don't know if that's resonating with anyone.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 That's how I felt led in prayer.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 But I just wanted to set that expectation for us today as we're here.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 I just want to encourage you to express your hunger for Jesus.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Say, "Holy Spirit, come. Fill my life. Do work in my life. Do something new.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I've been busy. There's other stuff that's going on.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And just do something new and do something beautiful."

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And so, well, when I was attending or when I was studying university,

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I attended a church in Texas.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And so this church was known for being a safe place, like a safe church

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 where people from all walks of life, from diverse backgrounds, they can come.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 It's safe. It's also a place of feeling, a place of processing.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And so that was the context of this church.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Now, a friend of mine and I, we both attended the church.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So on one Sunday, we both were early. We're talking with each other.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 It's nice to catch up. And I see this guy come in.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And I turn to my friend and say in a very judging way, "What is he doing here?"

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Now, I didn't know that person.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I just saw him for five seconds and made some observation, some judgment about him.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And I don't even know where that came from because I'm usually not the person

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 who says something like that. But I said it.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And my friend, he responded. He said, "Tim, for you and I to be here this Sunday morning,

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 it's not a big deal. It's easy for us to come here and to worship God.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 But for many people, they have so many challenges in their lives.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 There's so much difficulty that it is a big deal for them to be there."

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I'm even just sensing that for some of us here right now.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And then he said, "And this man, he had to overcome so many barriers

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 to just even be here this morning to worship with us together God."

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I was like, "Wow." It's like a mic drop moment, right?

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And he also put me in my place when I had spoken those thoughtless words.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Now, you see at this moment that the gospel was not fully worked out in my life.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 There was judgment. And I don't know what it was.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 In some sense, I was comparing myself with him. And I was saying that I belong and he doesn't.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I somehow measure up, he doesn't. I'm part of this church and he shouldn't be part of it.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I mean, I would have not said it like this, but that's what my judgment ultimately said, right?

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And so that moment showed me that there still is a lot of things that need to be worked out in my heart,

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 in my mind, in my thinking, in my feelings, in my actions.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And that I need more Jesus. I need more Jesus. And I still need more Jesus today.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I'm still a work in progress. I'm sure that some of you, you're feeling that way as well.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And I need the Holy Spirit to do a continuous work in my life, in my heart.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Now truth be told, we all at one point or another, we find ourselves in this place

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 where there's just things that pop up in our lives that are just not pretty,

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 where we see we are a work in progress. For me, it was that judgment.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 For you, maybe it's something else. Maybe it has something to do with relationships.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Maybe it has something to do with your workplace.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Maybe it has something to do with your private life or your ethics.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 I don't know, but you know.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And so, as I was preparing this message today, I just had the sense that Jesus really wants to lead us

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 in aligning our lives more with the truth of the gospel.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 To bring us more in alignment with the truth of the gospel.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 So I want to discuss with you this question.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 How can I more fully align my life with the truth of the gospel?

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And what does that look like? What does that even mean?

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 How can I take my life that's not where I want it to be, to be more fully like the life of Jesus?

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 That my life shines Jesus when somebody looks at it.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 That he can see, man, there's something different in this person's life.

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 That it shines Jesus.

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 So that's what I want to explore with you today through this message.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 We're in the book of Galatians. We're continuing our sermon series.

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 This is the third week. Actually, I don't know if you don't mind. Sorry. I apologize.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Can we turn the mic off for a second?

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I think I'm good.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 So let me set the context for our passage.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 So in the sermon series, we're exploring what does it mean to have Jesus at the center of our lives?

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 What does it mean to work out the gospel and the implications of the gospel for us as individuals, but also for us as a church?

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And so let me briefly set the context for our passage.

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So Paul, he started churches in Galatians.

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Actually, while he was sick, he planted his church, or actually multiple churches in Galatia.

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And then he left to move on to continuous work for God.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And other people followed him.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 The book of Galatians refers to them as a group of agitators.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And so they come in after him, and they're telling the Galatians that Paul is not truly preaching or sharing the gospel.

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 That he left out half the part because he's a people pleaser.

96
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And he didn't want to share the part that was difficult.

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And that part was like observing, in addition to believing in Jesus and what Jesus has done, that there was additional stuff that was needed.

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Like observing the law.

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 So they were worried about ethics.

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 That they wanted the life to be ethical.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 And then the second thing they accused Paul, and Pastor Andrew touched on that last week.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 That he was a second-rate apostle.

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 That his credentials didn't quite measure up.

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And so then Paul, in this letter, he knows that what these teachers are doing, they're leading the Galatians astray.

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 You know, they're leading them away from the truth.

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And Paul knows that this type of thinking, it's a spiritual dead end.

107
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 That it doesn't lead to the life that Jesus wants to unfold in his people.

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 It's a dead end.

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And so he writes this very, probably the most passionate letter in the New Testament.

110
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And very strongly defends this gospel message, the essence of the Christian faith.

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And so today, as we continue, this is a continuation of the defense of the gospel, that text that we're going to look at.

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 But before we read it, I want to provide a little bit of context as well.

113
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 There is a name that's being used, Cephas.

114
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Now Cephas is the Aramaic name for Peter.

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 So actually, when we read Peter, so just keep that in mind as I'm about to read the passage.

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 It's the Apostle Peter that this is talking about.

117
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Okay? You ready? Sounds good?

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Alright, let's do this.

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 So Galatians 2, starting in verse 11, says this.

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 "But when Cephas came to Aniak, I posed him to his face, because he stood condemned.

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 For before certain men came from James, he was eating with Gentiles.

122
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party.

123
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.

124
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 But when I saw that their conduct was not in line, not in step with the truth of the gospel,

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I said to Cephas, 'Before them all, if you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew,

126
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 how can you force Gentiles to live like Jews?'

127
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 We ourselves are Jews by birth, and not Gentile sinners.

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law,

129
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 but through faith in Jesus Christ.

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So we also have believed in Christ Jesus in order to be justified by faith in Christ,

131
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 and not by works of the law.

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Because the works of the law, no one will be justified.

133
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 But if in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners,

134
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 is Christ then a servant of sin?

135
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Certainly not.

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor.

137
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God.

138
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 I have been crucified with Christ, and the life I now live--

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.

140
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God,

141
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 who loved me and who gave himself for me.

142
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I do not nullify the grace of God.

143
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 For if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 That was a lot.

145
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 But this is some of the most powerful words in Scripture, and I want to unpack those.

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 So the first thing is, there is an incident, and it's between Peter and Paul.

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 So Paul, he says that, "I opposed them to his face."

148
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And he also says that he did that before them all, so he did it publicly.

149
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Now I don't know about you, but when somebody confronts someone else to their face

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 and does this publicly, it's a pretty big deal, right?

151
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Yes.

152
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And so what's going on here?

153
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 So what happened, and why is this a big deal?

154
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Why is Paul making such a big fuss?

155
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Well, let's explore that. What happened?

156
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Well, Peter, he's a Jewish man, so that's his background.

157
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And he had this powerful experience where God revealed to him that it was okay to eat certain foods,

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 and then servants from Cornelius came, and then he ended up eating with them.

159
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And so it was in the Book of Acts, the Scripture of the Mount,

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 because most Jewish people, because of their food laws and customs,

161
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 they don't eat with other people because they don't follow the same food laws.

162
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 But Peter, he was eating with Gentiles, so he had gotten past this.

163
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 But now a group of people came, the circumcision group, they came from Jerusalem,

164
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 and Peter caves into pressure, he caves into fear of them.

165
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Out of fear of them, he stops eating with Gentiles.

166
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And Gentiles, by the way, just means everyone else who's not a Jewish person,

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 so it would be most of us here.

168
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 And so he stops having table fellowship with them, he stops sharing meals.

169
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And so that's what happened. But why is this a big deal?

170
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Why can't Peter just eat with whoever he wants to eat with?

171
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Isn't anyone free to just eat who they want to eat with?

172
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Well, let me explain that a little bit.

173
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Now, I don't know if you have ever had the experience, maybe it's like with your company,

174
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 you want to go to lunch, or there's a company party and you try to sit at a table,

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 and even though people can make space for you, they choose not to.

176
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And there's some communication that they really don't want you to sit at their table.

177
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Now that doesn't feel good, right?

178
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 I also have to think of my own family story.

179
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 My father, he grew up and he was the target of my grandfather's anger.

180
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And so a lot of times my father was not allowed to eat with the family.

181
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 He had to eat by himself as a little kid.

182
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Now just think of how traumatic that is,

183
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 because ultimately what it's saying is, you're not really part of the family. Right?

184
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Well, that's kind of what's happening in this incident.

185
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Because when Peter stopped eating with the Gentiles,

186
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 they're all Christian brothers and sisters,

187
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 he's saying, you're not really part of this family.

188
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 There's something wrong with you. That's what his actions say.

189
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 That's a pretty ugly, ugly thing, right?

190
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Now sharing a meal together has always been, and still is today,

191
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 a powerful symbol of association.

192
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And there's still so much division around who we eat with.

193
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 There's still today lots of people who would not eat with a person

194
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 from a certain ethnic or cultural background,

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 or from somebody who's from a different socioeconomic class.

196
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 So all this stuff still happens today.

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And so that's part of the issue that Paul is calling out.

198
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But in Peter, there's also some, he's reverting back to his old ways.

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 There's also some pride from a people group,

200
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 where he's acting in that pride over against another group.

201
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Now in verse 13, we're told that Peter acted hypocritically.

202
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 So he actually didn't believe what he did was true, but he did it anyhow.

203
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 So it doesn't make it any better, right?

204
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 If you make people feel like they're not truly human,

205
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 and they need to eat somewhere else,

206
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 even if you don't truly believe that, but you act that way,

207
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 that's not good.

208
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Now, what made all of this worse, you have to think of who Peter is.

209
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Peter is one of the disciples of Jesus.

210
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 He is one of the main leaders in the early Christian movement,

211
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 and he's acting this way.

212
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Wow.

213
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And then suddenly, all these other people are starting to follow him,

214
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 all these other Jewish Christians, they're following his example.

215
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 That's a lot of times when leaders act wrongly,

216
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 and others follow because they think that person should know.

217
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And so his actions divide the body of Christ.

218
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 It says in verse 14, it says this,

219
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 "But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel,"

220
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 so he's talking about all of them following along,

221
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 "I set to see if it was before them all,"

222
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 actually, that's the part I want to look at, the first part,

223
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 "but when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel."

224
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 So this is the heart of the problem.

225
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Peter's action was not in step with the truth of the gospel,

226
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 because the truth of the gospel is this,

227
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 that God loves every single person equally,

228
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 that every single person is created in the image of God,

229
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 and that also every single person is saved equally.

230
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Like we all stand 100% sinful before God,

231
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 and we all need 100% of Jesus to rescue and deliver us.

232
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And then he makes us family, he makes us a spiritual family,

233
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 brothers and sisters in Christ,

234
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 and that's always powerful when a church lives that out,

235
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 when people from different socioeconomic backgrounds,

236
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 different ethnic backgrounds, different cultural backgrounds,

237
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 when they are a family and they love each other,

238
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 because that's usually not what we find in surrounding culture.

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Maybe we find it officially as slogans from companies,

240
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 but it's so many times not lived out,

241
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 and sadly sometimes it's not lived out in the church.

242
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 That's why for us this is so important.

243
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 We're an intentionally diverse church,

244
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 and we want to live out this truth of the gospel,

245
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 but here Peter was undermining it through his actions.

246
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 But that was not the only way.

247
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 The other way was that his actions also indirectly communicated

248
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 that Jesus' saving work is not enough,

249
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 that something else was needed,

250
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 that you needed to observe the Mosaic Law,

251
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 men had to go through circumcision,

252
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 so you had to do these extra stuff to have right standing with God.

253
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 That's what I was communicating, and Paul says no.

254
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 It's just Jesus. It's nothing else.

255
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 It's just Jesus.

256
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 So Paul takes Peter,

257
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 so they're still continuing this conversation, this conflict,

258
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 and he says this in verse 6,

259
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 and he says, "Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law,"

260
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 so he says, "Peter, you know that, but through faith in Jesus Christ."

261
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 So we also believed in Christ Jesus in order to be justified.

262
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 You and I, we did the same thing, man.

263
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 We believed in Jesus so that we can experience this right standing with God,

264
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 because by the works of the Lord, no one is justified.

265
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 You know, we know that.

266
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 So Peter's actions were undermining the truth of the Gospel.

267
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 His actions were not in line with the truth of the Gospel

268
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 when he was pushing people through his actions to observe these laws.

269
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Now, we are not saved because of something that we do,

270
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 but because of what Jesus Christ has done on the cross.

271
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And Christianity is kind of weird in this way,

272
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 because it says that there is nothing that you can do to earn right standing with God.

273
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

274
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 It sounds pretty depressing, right?

275
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 It doesn't matter how many good deeds you do.

276
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 It doesn't matter,

277
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 because the human problem is there's just sin in our hearts and our lives,

278
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 just like I shared in the beginning of my story.

279
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 There's just stuff in us, and that sin separates us from God.

280
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And it's so serious that Jesus came to die for us

281
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 and to deal with this problem that we cannot deal with,

282
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 so that we can have new life in him,

283
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 that we can experience forgiveness,

284
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 that we can become righteous people, truly righteous,

285
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 not out of our own strength,

286
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 but by the power of the Holy Spirit.

287
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 So Paul confronts Peter to his face,

288
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 because his actions are not in step with the truth of the gospel.

289
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 So that's what's going on here.

290
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 So this is a very critical observation, I believe, for us.

291
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 As Christians, we need to do our best to continue to ensure

292
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 that our lives are in step with the truth of the gospel.

293
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 God wants to bring alignment.

294
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 He wants us to reflect Jesus more.

295
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 So Paul is recounting all this stuff in this confrontation,

296
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 in his writing to the Galatians,

297
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 because they are losing their way.

298
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 They're getting unaligned with the truth of the gospel among themselves.

299
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 So that's why Paul shares a story with them, about this incident.

300
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And he's calling them back to align their lives with the truth of the gospel.

301
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 So what does it point to this...

302
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 What this all points to is that the gospel is not just something

303
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 that we believe to begin our Christian life.

304
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 A lot of times, as Christians, we think, "Oh, I graduated from the gospel.

305
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I believed, and now I moved on to discipleship and other stuff.

306
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I'm more mature. This was like the beginning."

307
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 But the gospel is something that we have to work out continuously in our lives.

308
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 So our thinking, our feeling, our actions

309
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 are more and more in step with the truth of the gospel.

310
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And I just wonder,

311
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 what are some of your thoughts, some of your feelings,

312
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 some of your actions right now

313
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 that are not in line, not in step with the truth of the gospel?

314
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 You know, where are we off?

315
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 So that brings me back to a question I asked at the beginning of the message.

316
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 How can I more fully align my life with the truth of the gospel?

317
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 You know, how do you do that?

318
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Well, we find some guidance from Paul in this passage that we're looking at today,

319
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 too, in verse 20, he says this,

320
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 "I have been crucified with Christ.

321
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.

322
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And the life I now live in the flesh,

323
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and who gave himself for me."

324
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 So there's a paradox here. There's a paradigm here for us.

325
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 That there is a dying that opens up a new way to living.

326
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 There is a dying that opens up a new way to living.

327
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 So Paul talks about being crucified with Christ.

328
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 That means his sinful self, his pride, his selfishness,

329
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 those things have been nailed to the cross.

330
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 They've been put to death by what Jesus has done.

331
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And he's been raised to a new life where it's now Christ who lives in him.

332
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And then what does that mean?

333
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Well, now, because of that has happened in Paul's life,

334
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 he now can live by faith in the Son of God who loves him and who gave him,

335
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 what does it say?

336
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Oh, look, here.

337
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 "Who loved me and gave himself for me."

338
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 So he can do that now.

339
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 He can do that by the power of the Holy Spirit.

340
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And so for our own journey,

341
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 how do we live this life of faith in the Son of God?

342
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 How do we live this life of faith in Jesus?

343
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 That's the Son of God.

344
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And how does that bring us to align our lives more with the truth of the gospel?

345
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Well, our journey always begins with dying to our old sinful self.

346
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 And yes, there's a once-and-for-all element to that for us

347
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 because Christ has won a victory for us, we're declared righteous.

348
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 It's like a verdict over our lives that stands for the rest of our lives.

349
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Like we are justified because of what Christ has done.

350
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 But then Jesus doesn't stop there.

351
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 There's an ongoing process.

352
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 It's called sanctification, where God wants to make us holy.

353
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 He wants to make us more and more like him because, let's be honest,

354
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 even in our lives, there's still a lot of stuff that needs to be worked out.

355
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And so there needs to be a continuous dying to our selfishness,

356
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 to our pride, to our sinful ways,

357
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 so that it opens up a new way to living differently,

358
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 to living in a powerful way that reflects the love of Jesus,

359
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 that Christ becomes alive in our lives, that he's visible in your life,

360
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 that he's visible in my life.

361
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And the Holy Spirit will lead us as we live that life of faith.

362
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And he will also convict us of the things

363
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 that still need convicting in our lives.

364
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And so ultimately, how do we align ourselves with the truth of the gospel?

365
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Well, it actually flows out of a personal relationship with Jesus

366
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 that we engage in continuously.

367
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And I want to explain this a little bit through a story.

368
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 So, another time at a university,

369
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 there was this guy that just really rubbed me the wrong way.

370
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Like, I just had a hard problem with him.

371
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 He was a good guy, he was nothing, he was not an evil person.

372
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I just really struggled with his personality.

373
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 I'm not going to ask if anyone can relate, right?

374
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 So on one occasion, he comes into my room,

375
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 he had been gone for the weekend, he forgot his toothbrush,

376
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 and he asked me if he can borrow my toothbrush.

377
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And I was like, "Dude, you don't borrow people's toothbrush.

378
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Let me buy you one."

379
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Another time, he was blocking the hallway, I needed to go to class.

380
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 I'm going to class, and he's like,

381
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 "You first got to fight me before you get through here."

382
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Now, he was as big as me, so just putting that in context.

383
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 But I was like, "I'm sorry, I just really need to go to class.

384
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Can you just please let me go to class?"

385
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And he didn't understand I was serious, and I tried multiple times,

386
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 I was like, "Please, I'm just trying to go to class.

387
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I don't want to fight you."

388
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And then finally, he's like, "No, you got to first fight me."

389
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 I was like, "Okay."

390
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 So I put my--I don't know what you call this,

391
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 I know the German word--you put your leg behind him,

392
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 I put him on the ground, and I was like, "I'm sorry, I need to go to class."

393
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 So I went to class.

394
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 But there was also a lot of judgment and pride in my heart towards him,

395
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 and talking bad behind his back.

396
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 So it was not pretty.

397
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Fast forward a year.

398
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I sign up at this university for a Christian community group.

399
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 I have no idea who's going to be placed in my community group.

400
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Guess who's in my community group?

401
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 It's him.

402
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 And so as soon as I see him, I'm like,

403
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 "I think I'm going to quit this community group."

404
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 But then something happened.

405
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 The Holy Spirit convicted me that my thinking and my feelings

406
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 were not what honored him.

407
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 And so then I knew that God wanted me to stay in this community group,

408
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 even though it was so difficult for me, and I really lacked the patience.

409
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 So I stayed in this community group.

410
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 I prayed.

411
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 I prayed for myself.

412
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I prayed for him.

413
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 I prayed for God to help me to listen, to be loving, to be caring.

414
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 And so that's the dying part.

415
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 You know, we have to die to my thinking, my feelings.

416
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 They're just not in line with Jesus, with his love.

417
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 And it doesn't happen overnight.

418
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 It's a process.

419
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 It's like a constant, like surrendering, "Jesus, take this.

420
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Help me.

421
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Help me, Jesus."

422
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 So then this went for two years.

423
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 One year was not enough for me.

424
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 I needed two years.

425
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And I can truthfully say that after two years,

426
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 I genuinely loved and appreciated my brother in Christ.

427
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 I really did.

428
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And I didn't feel annoyed anymore.

429
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 I didn't have those feelings, and God really changed my heart.

430
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 He aligned my thinking and my feelings with the truth of the gospel.

431
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 But there's another aspect to this.

432
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Now, why would you do that?

433
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Why would I -- you know, when you go on Instagram and you look at the influencers,

434
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 they tell you, "You do you.

435
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 You just do what you feel like," right?

436
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 So if I were to do what I felt like, I would never stay in that group.

437
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 But it's because Jesus is in my life, and the Holy Spirit is at work.

438
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 He's like, "Uh-uh.

439
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 You're not who I've created you to be, Tim.

440
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 I want you to be more fully -- be conformed to my image.

441
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I want you to be a more true reflection, expression of my love."

442
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And, of course, we can say no to that, even as Christians.

443
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 So it's a daily -- our aligning ourselves with the truth of the gospel,

444
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 with our thinking, with our feelings, with our actions,

445
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 but there's a daily living out that relationship with Jesus

446
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 and just relying on his grace, coming to him in prayer,

447
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 dying to all parts of ourselves so that we can be raised,

448
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 so that there's a new path for new living.

449
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 You know, that's what he wants to do.

450
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 He wants some parts to die so there's a new way of living,

451
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 there's true transformation.

452
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 So those are things that we can't do on ourselves.

453
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 This is the work of God in our lives, 100%.

454
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 This was not me.

455
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 All I can say is, "Okay, Jesus, yes, I hear what you're saying.

456
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Help me."

457
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 You know, and that's what that means.

458
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 That's what it means to live by faith in the Son of God who loved me

459
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 and who died for me.

460
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 I want to summarize things here.

461
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 The realigning of our thoughts, feelings, and actions to the truth of the gospel

462
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 happens as we consistently live out our personal relationship with Jesus.

463
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 And I believe that's what Jesus is calling us.

464
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 If you're a Christian, I believe that's what Jesus is calling you this morning.

465
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Just to draw back into that relationship with him,

466
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 to say yes to what he's saying to you.

467
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 He's speaking to you.

468
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 I don't know what he's saying to you, but you know.

469
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 You have the Holy Spirit living in you.

470
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 You know, to say yes to that, to say, "Yes, Jesus, I want what you want,

471
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 not what I want.

472
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Not my way, but your way.

473
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Not my will, but your will."

474
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 And we surrender, say, "Jesus, take my life and lead me into this life that you have."

475
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 And we can trust that whatever Jesus has is always better than our own plans.

476
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 It's always better.

477
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 He created us.

478
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 He knows.

479
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 So I want to invite the worship team to come up.

480
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Now, as I was reading over this powerful statement from Paul,

481
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 "I have been crucified with Christ.

482
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.

483
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 And the life I now live, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me

484
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 and gave himself for me."

485
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I love how personal Paul puts us here.

486
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 This is not a general truth.

487
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 This is deeply personal to Paul.

488
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 And it's really this love, you know, when we know Jesus,

489
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 that's out of--because he loved us so much, that's why we even care to do this stuff.

490
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 That's why instead of just doing you do you, you know, do your thing,

491
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 we actually say, "Jesus, I want to do what you want to do," because he loved us.

492
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 He poured out his life for you, for me, on his cross so that we can be forgiven,

493
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 that we can be brought in relationship.

494
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 So he loved--the letter of John says, "We love because God first loved us."

495
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And so he wants to move us today deeper into his love

496
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 from people whose faith is expressed in love towards other people.

497
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 And God gives us the grace. He gives us the forgiveness.

498
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 I shared all this ugly stuff about my life, right,

499
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 all this inner dialogue that most people never see.

500
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 But even in that, God meets us with grace.

501
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 He meets us with forgiveness because he loves us.

502
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 And so I just wonder, you know, how is Jesus inviting you to respond to his love today?

503
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 How is he inviting you deeper into what he has for your life?

504
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 What are some areas in your life where you're thinking,

505
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 your feelings and actions are not aligned with the truth of the gospel?

506
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Where is the Holy Spirit leading you to do some dying so that he can open up a new way of living for you?

507
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 This is good news. You can truly change.

508
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 You can become a more loving, beautiful person, not because of you,

509
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 but because of Jesus working in your life, because of the Holy Spirit moving you, transforming you.

510
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 But it's our choice to say yes to that.

511
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And so I just want to actually invite you right now into a prayer time.

512
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Just what's God been saying to you throughout this service?

513
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 And just to talk to him.

514
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 So you can ponder on those questions that I asked there, and in about two minutes I'll pray for us.

515
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 So let's pray right now.

516
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Let's commune with Jesus.
