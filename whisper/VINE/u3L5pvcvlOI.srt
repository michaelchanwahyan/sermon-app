1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Everybody says, amen.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hey, can we thank our worship team as always?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Amazing, amazing.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Have a seat, have a seat.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Come on in.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 There are some people standing.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 We do have a few seats.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Here in the front, there's about three or four seats.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 So if anybody's standing, come, come, come.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 No one's looking at you, don't worry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Actually, everybody's looking at you.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 It's okay, just come.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Come, come, come, come.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I need about four people, three people, four people.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Come grab a seat, please.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 My man, God is dope.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Come with me, come here, come here.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 What's up, man?

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 God is dope, baby.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 God is dope.

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 There we go.

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 All right, all right, cool.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 My seat is also available.

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Anybody else need a seat?

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Lovely lady here.

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hi, how are you?

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Come on in.

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 This is the anointed seat.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 It's because you're next to Jess.

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 There you go, have a seat.

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 All right, welcome to the Vine.

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 My name's Andrew.

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 If you're new here, we're so glad you're here.

34
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I want to address the elephant on my face, which is the massive lip that I currently have,

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 and the big blister on my lip.

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I thought if I don't address this at the start, you'll all wonder what happened to me.

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So let me tell you the story.

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I've just come back from New Zealand.

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 I just had a short holiday in New Zealand.

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And whilst I was in New Zealand, I went swimming with dolphins.

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 And swimming with dolphins is amazing.

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 And I'm out there in the ocean.

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I'm swimming with these incredible dolphins.

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 They're baby dolphins with us.

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And the baby dolphins are super cute.

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And then a stingray comes out of nowhere and starts to attack the baby dolphins.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And I was the nearest, and I thought, "I'm going to put myself between the baby dolphins and the stingray."

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 So I swam and put myself between the baby dolphins and the stingray.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 The stingray didn't like that.

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 It stung me in the lip.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And if that story was true, that would be really cool.

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 But...

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 That's not what happened.

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Thank you. Thank you.

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I actually just got sunburned.

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And I got so badly sunburned on my lip that it swelled up.

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And the way it looks right now actually is kind of a lot better.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 It really swelled up.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And I got this blister, and it got infected.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And I had to go to the hospital last night.

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I landed last night, went straight to the hospital.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Anyway, all that to say, here at The Vine, we say, "Come as you are."

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And so I did think about putting on a mask today, but I'm coming as I am.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 All the good, bad, and ugly of me in this moment.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Don't worry. If you're in the front row, it's not contagious.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Okay? You guys are all good.

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 One thing that is... I would appreciate prayer.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 It's actually very painful, as you can probably imagine.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And so it actually hurts to talk.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And I was praying yesterday, and I was like, "God, I'm sharing a word for the church at the start of the year."

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And it's actually painful to talk.

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 But I want to do this because what we want to share today with you guys

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 is something that our eldership, our pastoral team, our staff have discerned, we've prayed into.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And I want to share something that is a correction to us as a church

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 as well as an invitation to us.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And you know when God speaks, and He brings a correcting word,

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 it's important that a church community like ours, or like any church community, listens to what God says.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But it's also important that we don't just hear it privately as a leadership.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 We want to make sure that that's publicly aware and publicly understood.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 But I also want to share it for this reason.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 I believe what we're talking about today is actually fundamentally

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 what God wants to do and shape in your life in the year ahead.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 You might have come into the Vine today, 1st Sunday of 2024,

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 praying, wondering what is it that God wants to do in your life?

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 How is it that God wants to speak to you today?

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And if the Vine is your community of faith, if this is where you regularly worship,

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 then I want to put it to you that what we're going to talk about today and over the next five weeks,

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 and actually what we're going to talk about today, we're going to be talking about the whole year, all of 2024,

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 is actually not just a word for us as a corporate church,

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 it's also a word for you personally, individually.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And I feel like God's got a few things He wants to say.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So I wonder whether we could pray as we come into this time together.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Father, what a joy it is to gather on a day like today,

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 and to be a community together, and to come under the ministry of your word,

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 not my words, not any pastor or leader's words, but under your word.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Lord, I want to pray that your word would speak today.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Father, I thank you that every single person in this room you love,

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 you find is the joy of your heart.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And Lord, you have something you want to say.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And Lord, I pray that whatever words that I'm going to say,

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 and not of you would fall away from their ears, your words would stick and remain true.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And Lord, we open our hearts to your voice.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And I just want to pray, maybe you could just take a moment, just five seconds, to pray in your own heart.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Lord, I'm open to what you want to say to me this year.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Maybe just make that a prayer right now, just in the quietness of your heart.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Lord, I'm open to what it is that you want to say to me this year.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And Father, we are excited by that. And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Everyone says.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Back in September, end of September, I received a dream from God.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And it was whilst I was on holiday in Koh Samui in Thailand.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And if you've been at the Vine for any period of time,

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 you'll probably know that often God speaks to me in dreams.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 That's often how I hear from the Lord.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Weirdly though, I often receive these dreams when I'm actually on holiday.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 I think this is kind of bizarre because as a pastor, as a full-time pastor,

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 I carve time out regularly during my work schedule to hear and discern and to get dreams and vision from God.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 But the time that he often chooses to download stuff to me is whilst I'm on holiday.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 So I actually have said to my elders, "You should just keep me on holiday the whole time for the benefit of the church."

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 But they didn't buy that.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 But anyway, oftentimes God speaks to me when I'm on holiday.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And here it was, the same thing, actually the last night of this holiday that Chris and I were having for our 25th anniversary.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And God gave me a dream.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And I know when the dreams are from God, they're incredibly vivid.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 They're incredibly detailed.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 And usually they have something to say to us as a church community.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And so let me tell you about this dream.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 In the dream, I was in a massive large room, a room not too dissimilar to this one.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Actually, it was probably a bit bigger than this one, but it was a big large room.

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 And the room was completely empty.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 There was nothing in this room except for two armchairs in the middle of the room.

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And in the dream, I found myself sitting in one of the armchairs, and opposite me was another armchair.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And that armchair was... nobody was there. It was empty.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And as I'm sitting there staring at this empty armchair in this massive empty room, God's presence fell in the room.

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And it was the most incredible thing.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The glory of God was all around the room.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 His presence was in the atmosphere.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And actually, it reminded me straight away of those times when we gathered to worship here at the Vine.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And we've just experienced an incredible time of worship here together this morning.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And it's those moments that my mind went to as I'm sitting in this chair,

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 and I'm experiencing this incredible sense of God being in the atmosphere, being in the room.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 You know what it's like when you come to worship here, and it feels like there's this kind of tangible reality of God in the air, if you will.

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And that's what it felt like.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 But as I was sitting there in this dream, a thought went straight through my mind.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And the thought was this.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I'm not satisfied with God just being in the atmosphere around me in the room.

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 I want God to come and sit down opposite me.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 My heart was, as much as I was enjoying the reality of His presence around us,

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 I wanted Jesus to come and sit with me and be tangibly present with me

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 so that we could be face to face together,

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 so that we could commune in a way that is far deeper and far more intimate

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 than just the reality of His presence in the room.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 You following this?

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And so as I thought this, as I was like, "God, I don't want you just around me.

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I want you with me. I want you here. I want you physically here."

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 I saw all these shards of light and all this kind of light that sort of flashed around the chair itself.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And then I saw the cushion of the chair depress, as if somebody with some weight had just sat down,

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 although I didn't see anybody, but I knew that Jesus had just sat down in front of me.

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And this dream was incredibly real.

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And I knew that Jesus had sat down in front of me, but I couldn't see Him.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I didn't see His face or anything, but I knew He was there, not just in the room,

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 but now fully present with me.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And I have to tell you, it was the most at peace in this dream.

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 By the way, when I dream and God speaks to me in dreams, I can kind of think about it

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 in the moment that it's happening, and I kind of reflect as it's going.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And it was like, this is the most tangible sense of the presence and the power and the peace

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 and the shalom of God that I've ever felt.

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 And it almost was like in Jesus sitting right opposite me, even in my sin, in my brokenness,

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 in the stuff that's ugly about me, the things that I don't talk about, all the stuff that I try to avoid,

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 all of that was present to Him and none of it mattered at all.

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I had complete wholeness in Him.

171
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 It's basically what the Bible speaks about as shalom, completeness.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 I was completely how I was designed to be as I was sitting opposite Jesus.

173
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 It was the most beautiful kind of experience that I've ever had.

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Now, right as I had kind of got my head around the reality of this beautiful experience,

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 suddenly it changed.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 And rather than Jesus being sat next to me or opposite me, suddenly a young adult from here at the Vine

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 that I know, she was sitting suddenly opposite me, which was a bit of a jarring experience

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 because it was Jesus and then it became this young lady.

179
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 And this young lady I know here at the Vine, and she's single.

180
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And as she's sitting there, and before I can communicate with her or anything,

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 she stands up and she turns sideways and she's pregnant.

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And I thought, "This is bizarre."

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Because she's single, I know her, she's single, and she stands up and she turns to the side

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 to show me that she's pregnant.

185
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Now, in all of this, I know that God's speaking to me about worship and our community as a church.

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I know that all of this dream, because of the way it started and the presence of God in the room

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 and it reminded me of the Vine, I know that all of this is speaking about our worship.

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 So this lady was representing, in a way, worship at the church, and she's pregnant.

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And I think immediately this is good news.

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 What God's saying is, "In 2024, we should be pregnant with expectation in our worship at the Vine."

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 That God is going to birth some incredible things in our church this year.

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 But immediately, God was like, "Nah."

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Because I knew she was single, but she was pregnant.

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And something didn't feel right.

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 The picture of it, the reality of it, I wasn't expecting it.

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 It didn't feel right. It wasn't quite the way things should be.

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And I felt immediately that God was saying, "Andrew, in the worship at the Vine..."

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Now, when I talk about worship at the Vine, I'm not talking about band or songs or music or that.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 I'm talking about your adoration, our adoration of Jesus.

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 That's worship, our thanksgiving and adoration and praise, our lifestyle, the way we are.

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Our worship at the Vine, God was saying, "Andrew, it's not quite right.

202
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 There's something wrong.

203
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Sometimes it looks right. Sometimes it doesn't look right.

204
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 There's some problem with the worship."

205
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And as I was sitting in the reality of this lady who was pregnant, it didn't feel right.

206
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 I knew that there was something wrong here.

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 I felt like God said this, "Here's the sense, Andrew.

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 The church has settled for the general atmosphere of God,

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 and they are not pushing beyond that to the actual person of God."

210
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And I want to say this as strongly to us as I can.

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 That I think one of the corrections God is bringing to us at the Vine is that at times here at the Vine,

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 we have settled simply for the general atmosphere of God.

213
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Oh, we come in on a Sunday and we sing our songs and we enjoy a nice feeling together,

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 and we think that that's enough.

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And we've settled for the general atmosphere of God,

216
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 and we haven't pushed beyond that to meet with the actual person of God.

217
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 As I was sitting in that reality, suddenly my dream changed and gone were the two chairs.

218
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And here's what happened next.

219
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 There was a great big bed.

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 There was a massive bed, a bed as big as you could ever imagine in this room,

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 filled with this whole room.

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 It was one big bed, one massive mattress.

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And on this bed, I could see all these people sitting.

224
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 There were some people sitting on their own.

225
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 There were some people sitting as couples.

226
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 There were some people sitting in groups, like as friends in groups.

227
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And all of them were covered in bed sheets on this massive bed.

228
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Now, it's important that you understand there wasn't anything overtly sexual in this,

229
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 but I knew that God was speaking to me about intimacy.

230
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And He was saying, "Here's the reality.

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 I have created people to be intimate with me,

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 but at the vine, you have replaced your desire to be intimate with me

233
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 with only a desire to be intimate with one another."

234
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Come on, church.

235
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 I know this is strong, but I'm putting it out there.

236
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 That we have replaced our rightful desire to be intimate with God,

237
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 and we are only interested in being intimate with one another.

238
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Whether that's groups of friends in the intimacy of friendship,

239
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 whether that was couples in the intimacy of sexual intimacy,

240
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 whether it was people who were on their own trying to find intimacy in various other ways,

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 I think the bed represented a lot of different things,

242
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 but it was the reality that there are alternative forms of intimacy

243
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 that you can experience.

244
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 As soon as I saw that, the bed disappeared again, and, woom,

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I was straight back to the two chairs, and once again, I was sitting in the armchair.

246
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And right opposite me, the armchair decompressed once again

247
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 as the presence of Jesus sat down.

248
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And as soon as the presence of Jesus sat down in front of me again,

249
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 I felt this incredible, powerful sense of peace and calm.

250
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Immediately, I knew that every longing I had in my heart,

251
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 every thing that I desired, all the intimacy that I could ever want for

252
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 was satisfied in the reality of the presence of God.

253
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Not the atmosphere of God, but the person of God who was right here with me.

254
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And this time, I jumped up in my dream.

255
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 And I jumped up, and I'm like, "Jesus, please stay there. Don't go anywhere."

256
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 But I was like, "I want others to experience this, right?"

257
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Like, I don't want to be selfish here.

258
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 I don't want to be the only one who ever gets to feel complete and whole.

259
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And so in the dream, I started to look around the room,

260
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 and I tried to find some other people. Remember, it was a big, empty room.

261
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 But I wanted to try and find some other people to come and sit down with me

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 and experience the intimacy that I was experiencing with Jesus.

263
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And that was my longed for and my wish for,

264
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 and that was basically everything that I could feel in every ounce of me was,

265
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 "Where are the people who will come and experience,

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 who will be willing to sit for a moment and experience this intimacy with Jesus?"

267
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And on that thought, unfortunately, I woke up.

268
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And there I was, in my bed in Koh Samui, Thailand, on holiday,

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 and I felt like I was in the worst place in the world

270
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 because I had just experienced the best place in the world,

271
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 that there is nothing that can ever replace the intimacy of Jesus Christ.

272
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And when you've experienced it like that,

273
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 everything else is sort of this other kind of experience.

274
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And although I was in paradise and in this beautiful place,

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 I longed to get back to that.

276
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 I grabbed my phone from the side of my bed,

277
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 and I started to make all these notes about the dream

278
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 so that I could tell you on the 7th of January.

279
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 But I wrote all the details about the dream down as much as I could,

280
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 and I started to reflect a little bit about intimacy

281
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 because I realized that what God's really speaking to us about is intimacy in this year.

282
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 In fact, everything we're going to talk about here at The Vine is going to be that one thing.

283
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 We're going to talk a lot about intimacy.

284
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Here's the first thing you need to know about intimacy.

285
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Every human being has been created with a desire, a longing for intimacy.

286
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I believe that this is a God-created desire in all of us.

287
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 God has created every human being with a desire to find intimacy,

288
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 and that intimacy is both with Him and also with one another.

289
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 That it is a good and a holy thing to want to be intimate.

290
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 That we long and desire for intimacy.

291
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And that desire that we have is so deep in us, so visceral in us,

292
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 that it only ever fulfills its fullness in our relationship with God.

293
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I realized as I was literally sitting there writing all this down on my phone

294
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 at like 3 in the morning or whatever it was,

295
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 I remembered this is the reason why God created in the first place.

296
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 I mean think about it for a moment. Think about it theologically.

297
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 We're going to get theological. We've gone from dreams to theology.

298
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Okay, with me. Think about it theologically.

299
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Because in the Godhead at the beginning of all things,

300
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

301
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 there is an eternal intimacy that they have that is the fullness and the completeness of Shalom.

302
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 God did not need anything other than the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit together.

303
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 In other words, creation is not to satisfy something that God lacks.

304
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Are you with me?

305
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 God has the fullness of intimacy.

306
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 If you want to know and understand what intimacy is,

307
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in the fullness together is the picture of intimacy.

308
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 The reason why God creates is invitation.

309
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 He creates because He wants to invite others into that intimacy.

310
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 In the same way that I jumped out of my chair and I was like, "Jesus, stay there."

311
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 But who else can experience this with me?

312
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 I could almost imagine the Trinity getting together.

313
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 "Hey, guys, this is amazing, but let's create

314
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 so that others can come and be a part of this, and they can experience this,

315
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 and they can know what the fullness is of this incredible intimacy.

316
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 And that intimacy will create the fullness in them, and it will be like this incredible thing."

317
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 The first thing you need to know about intimacy is that it's founded on three things,

318
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 creation, love, and invitation.

319
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Every form of intimacy makes space for others.

320
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Intimacy creates a place for others to come.

321
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Intimacy invites and loves and creates.

322
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And here is the really scary thing.

323
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Every human being has this innate desire for that kind of intimacy,

324
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 but in our fallen nature, in our brokenness,

325
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 and in the struggles that we all hold in us,

326
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 we more often than not seek the satisfaction of that desire for intimacy

327
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 in things that can never satisfy it.

328
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 One of the great stories of Scripture is human beings trying to find intimacy

329
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 in other things other than in God, because they have this desire in them,

330
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 and that desire drives them to try to satisfy it.

331
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 But in order to try to satisfy that desire,

332
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 they begin to look to one another for satisfaction that only God can bring.

333
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Not that again, connecting with one another and being intimate with one another is a bad thing.

334
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 It's not. It's a good and holy thing, but we have to get the order right.

335
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 "Love the Lord your God with all your mind, heart, soul, and strength.

336
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Love your neighbor as yourself."

337
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Know what it is to be intimately connected with God,

338
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 so that out of the overflow of the intimacy, the fulfillment, the connection,

339
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 we can jump up and invite others to it.

340
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Our intimacy with one another is a response to the intimacy with God.

341
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 But so often in our brokenness, we make our intimacy with one another the true intimacy.

342
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 We think that's where we will get connected,

343
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 when that so often just leads to further brokenness.

344
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Let me put it in terms of the dream for you.

345
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 There is an invitation to a deep and personal armchair experience with God.

346
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 But so often we choose the more shallow, the more immediate bed experience in intimacy with one another.

347
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 That's just the reality of us as human beings.

348
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And it's also, I think, the reality for us here at the Vine.

349
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And as God began to unpack some of this to us, I began to see and sense His correction.

350
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 I came back from the holiday to the staff here,

351
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 and I began to talk to our staff and our elders and our pastors about this idea of intimacy.

352
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 And as God so often does, God doesn't ever just speak to one person.

353
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 He never just speaks to the senior pastor.

354
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 He had been speaking to many people in our staff, many people in our intercession team,

355
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 for over a year about the same sort of ideas, the same threads,

356
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 that there's something not quite right in our worship,

357
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 that there's something not quite right within our community,

358
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 that we're not engaging in intimacy with God in the way that He designed it for me.

359
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And as we began to talk about it, and as we began to pray about it,

360
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 as we began to discern what it is that God is saying,

361
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I think ultimately what He's saying is this,

362
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 that so often we show up on a Sunday,

363
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 and we experience this incredible sense of worship like we had this morning,

364
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and we stop there. We think that is enough.

365
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Or we think that that's what it's all about.

366
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 That's not what it's about.

367
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Intimacy with God is not fully about coming to church on a Sunday.

368
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And if we ever make the reality of our intimacy with God

369
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 based on the atmosphere we feel at the vine on a Sunday,

370
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 oh, we are so missing out on the completeness of who we've been designed to be.

371
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 You have not been designed for the atmosphere of God.

372
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 You've been designed for the person of God.

373
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Come on, church. Anyone here? Yeah?

374
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 There's a passage in Scripture that I love.

375
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 It's found in Psalm 100, verse 4, and it says this,

376
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 "We enter His gates with thanksgiving in His hearts."

377
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 We go into the courts with praise.

378
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 The psalmist is being beautiful here because the psalmist is creating an imagery of the temple.

379
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 He's talking literally about the temple.

380
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And if you know anything about the temple,

381
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 it was designed with the Holy of Holies right in the center of the temple,

382
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 where the fullness of God's presence was.

383
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And in the Holy of Holies, only one priest could go in once a year,

384
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 and only after a purification rite of a number of days.

385
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And it was always a thing.

386
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 But outside of the Holy of Holies was where the sacrifices were made.

387
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And that was where the priest stood for the atonement of sin.

388
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 It was one of the most intimate expressions and connections

389
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 that humanity could ever have with God.

390
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And outside of the inner courts were the outer courts.

391
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And on the outer courts is where they paid for the animals to be sacrificed,

392
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 where they did business, where they connected communally.

393
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And then outside of that were gates that led people into all of that.

394
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 The idea in the temple was that you went through the gates into a deeper place of intimacy.

395
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And the psalmist says, "Do you want to know what it is that brings you as a human being

396
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 into a deeper place of intimacy?

397
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 It's worship.

398
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 It's worship. It's adoration. It's thanksgiving. It's praise.

399
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 You enter the gates with thanksgiving on your heart.

400
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 You go into the courts with praise.

401
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 And your worship, your worship is the vehicle that moves you

402
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 from outside of God's presence into the heart of His presence.

403
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 The problem is, he did not write, "You camp at the gates with thanksgiving in your heart."

404
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 He did not say, "You stand on the outside of the courts

405
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 and you just stay there with praise."

406
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 He says, "There's movement. You're going from the outside into the inner place."

407
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 The problem I think we have at the vine sometimes

408
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 is that we're camping at the gates with our worship.

409
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And every time we think that when we gather on a Sunday

410
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 and we experience this incredible sense of God's presence,

411
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 as important and as good as that is, but when we think that that's enough,

412
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 or when we think that that's all there is, oh, we are so missing out.

413
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 We're camping at the gates.

414
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 I want you to have a mind shift.

415
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I want you to think every Sunday when you come in

416
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 and we experience the power of God together,

417
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 which is a beautiful, precious thing.

418
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 You should be thinking, "That's a gate.

419
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 This is a gate right now. I'm entering through this into something else.

420
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And that something else is a deeper, more intimate, more personal relationship with God

421
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 where God will tell me things that will shape and change me.

422
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Not always things that I can handle. Not always things that I like.

423
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 But God, I want that deepened relationship.

424
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 I don't want you in the atmosphere. I want you right here."

425
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 We enter His gates with thanksgiving on our hearts.

426
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And God is saying that this is a correction, but it's also an invitation.

427
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 It's an invitation for us as a church to go,

428
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 "This is what I want to make 2024 about.

429
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 If there's anything I could start the new year with,

430
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 surely it's this, that actually I get the great joy of being a human being

431
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 that experiences incredible intimacy with others,

432
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 but that intimacy comes first and foremost through my intimacy with God."

433
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 See, here's the thing you need to realize.

434
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Our vision here at The Vine is growing big people.

435
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 It's all about your maturity in Jesus.

436
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 We do everything at The Vine to help you to grow in your maturity with Jesus.

437
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Hear this, you will always remain spiritually immature

438
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 if all you ever do is connect with the atmosphere of God.

439
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 I'm going to say that again.

440
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 You will always stay spiritually immature

441
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 if all you ever do is connect with just the atmosphere of God,

442
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 rather than pressing through that to the actual true and living person of Jesus.

443
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And as wonderful as His atmosphere is,

444
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 as wonderful as that presence is on a Sunday,

445
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 it's an invitation to you to intimacy.

446
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Are you with me?

447
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 It's not an invitation for you to feel good on a Sunday.

448
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 It's an invitation to a life that is changed

449
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 by the intimacy of your relationship with Jesus Christ.

450
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 So what we're going to do over this series here at the start of the year,

451
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 over the next four weeks, we're going to unpack this idea

452
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 of how we can enter through the gates.

453
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Over the next two weeks, I'm going to talk to you about

454
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 some of the ways that we struggle in our intimacy with God.

455
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 I'm actually going to talk to you about two of the very key ways

456
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 that we actually stop ourselves from being intimate with Jesus.

457
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 And then we're going to have two weeks

458
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 where we're going to look at alternative forms of intimacy,

459
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 the things that we turn to other than in our direct intimacy with God.

460
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 And I believe through that, we'll be able to paint a picture for you

461
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 of what it is that we sense God is both correcting us in,

462
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 but also inviting us lovingly to in the year ahead.

463
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Is this helping anyone so far?

464
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Are you excited for your year?

465
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Yeah. Okay.

466
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Now, what I want to do is I bring things to a bit of a close.

467
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 I want to tell you a little bit about what this vision for intimacy is like.

468
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 I want to give you a taste of what this intimacy can feel like, can be like.

469
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 The Bible is filled with stories about this intimacy with God,

470
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 this closeness with Him.

471
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And rather than sort of say, "Hey, here are the five steps

472
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 that you can do in your life to be intimate with God."

473
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 The reality is intimacy is a very personal thing.

474
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 I mean, if you talk about me and my wife, Chris, our intimacy together,

475
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 we don't share in intimacy with anyone else.

476
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 It's a personal thing. It's a unique thing.

477
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And I'm not just talking about sexual intimacy.

478
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 I'm talking about communication and what we do as friends

479
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 and how we enjoy life, the shows that we like or whatever it is.

480
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 There's a uniqueness to our intimacy.

481
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 There's going to be a uniqueness to your intimacy with God.

482
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 So we're not going to say, "This is exactly what you have to do

483
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 in order to be intimate," because that's for you to discover.

484
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 What we will do, though, is paint for you a broad and beautiful picture

485
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 of what intimacy with Jesus looks like.

486
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And our prayer is, as you see that intimacy, you're going to go,

487
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 "What can I do in my life to get like that?"

488
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Are you with me?

489
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 All right. So let me paint for you this intimacy.

490
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Now, before I read this, by the way, I'm about to read to you a psalm of David.

491
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 You need to understand David was not a perfect person.

492
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 David had many struggles.

493
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 David was broken, and David had brokenness in intimacy.

494
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 He had brokenness of sexual intimacy.

495
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 He had brokenness with his friends.

496
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 David is a complicated person.

497
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And yet, even in the complications of his brokenness,

498
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 he can express this desire and this need to be deeply intimate with God.

499
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And I think that's an encouragement for some of you here,

500
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 because you might be hearing this, and you might be going,

501
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 "Well, I'm not that kind of Christian.

502
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 I'm not even sure if I am a Christian.

503
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I'm not even sure if God can accept me intimately.

504
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 I don't even know if He wants me to be with Him."

505
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 And you might be thinking that your sin or your brokenness or your background

506
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 disqualifies you from intimacy with Jesus.

507
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 If David is qualified, you are qualified.

508
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Are you with me?

509
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Now listen to this. Psalm 63 says this.

510
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Listen to how David expresses his intimacy with God.

511
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 "O God, You are my God.

512
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Earnestly I seek You. My soul thirsts for You.

513
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 My body longs for You.

514
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 In a dry and weary land where there is no water,

515
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 I have seen You in the sanctuary and beheld Your power and Your glory.

516
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Because Your love is better than life, my lips will glorify You.

517
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 I will praise You as long as I live, and in Your name I will lift up my hands.

518
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 My soul will be satisfied as with the richest of foods.

519
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 My singing lips, my mouth will praise You.

520
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 On my bed I remember You.

521
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 I think of You through the watches of the night, because You are my help.

522
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 I sing in the shadow of Your wings.

523
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 My soul clings to You. Your right hand upholds me.

524
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Those who seek my life will be destroyed.

525
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 They will go down to the depths of the earth.

526
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.

527
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 But the King will rejoice in God.

528
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 All who swear by God's name will praise Him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced.

529
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Can you hear David's passion?

530
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 He's like, "Let me tell you about what this intimate relationship that I have with God is like.

531
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 I mean, it's my everything. Everything in me longs and yearns to be connected to Him."

532
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Notice just some of the things that he says.

533
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 He actually paints for us a beautiful picture of biblical immanency.

534
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 He says, first of all, "You are my God."

535
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 I love this. "You are my God," he says.

536
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 In other words, there's no other God.

537
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 There's no other thing that I can be intimate with that could ever satisfy me.

538
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 You are the only thing that can satisfy me.

539
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 And notice, he says, "You are my God."

540
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 He doesn't say, "You are Israel's God."

541
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 He doesn't say, "You're a God of some nation."

542
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 He didn't say, "You're the God of the vine at 11 a.m. on a Sunday."

543
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 He says, "You're my God."

544
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 This is personal.

545
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 I know you. I want you.

546
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 We're together. We're connected and committed.

547
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 You are my God.

548
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Some of you, the best prayer you can do in 2024, right at the start,

549
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 is simply to say that prayer after the service.

550
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 "God, you are my God."

551
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Because some of you, maybe that will be a struggle.

552
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 But for some of you, that's your soul cry.

553
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 That's your first response to recognize that maybe you haven't been able to say that,

554
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 but that's the desire of your heart.

555
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 "You are my God."

556
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 Notice the passion he brings.

557
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Notice things like, "My soul thirsts for you.

558
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 My body longs for you because your love is better than life.

559
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 My soul will be satisfied. It's with the richest of foods.

560
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 My soul clings to you."

561
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 He talks about this idea of his soul, the innermost part of who he is.

562
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Not just his being or his thinking,

563
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 but everything about him longs for this intimacy with God,

564
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 and he's crying out for that intimacy.

565
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 That's like me sitting there and going,

566
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 "I'm not satisfied anymore with you in the atmosphere.

567
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 I want you right here.

568
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 My soul clings to you," says David.

569
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Now notice he talks about two very important things.

570
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 He says, "I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory."

571
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 There it is.

572
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 "I have seen you at 11 o'clock at the vine in Wanjai,

573
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 and I beheld your power and your glory."

574
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Amen?

575
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I want you to hear this, everything I've been saying today.

576
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 We're not changing anything in terms of what we do here on a Sunday.

577
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 We love the reality of God's presence with us.

578
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 We'll continue to worship and praise him and do all the things that we do.

579
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 What we're calling for is a bit of a mindset change,

580
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 because what we do on a Sunday is not necessarily wrong,

581
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 but how we're reacting to it is what I think God is trying to create.

582
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Because David says, "I've seen you in the sanctuary.

583
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 I beheld your power in that place."

584
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 It's an amazing thing he's saying.

585
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 "I love the sanctuary.

586
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 I love the power that I feel and experience there."

587
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 But notice what he also says.

588
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 He also says, "On my bed I remember you.

589
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 Through the watches of the night you are with me."

590
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 In other words, I have felt your glory in church, but guess what?

591
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Your glory is not just in the church.

592
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 I've been intimate with you on a Sunday at 11 o'clock, but guess what?

593
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 God, you're also intimate with me at work on a Monday morning at 9.

594
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 Guess what? You're there with me all the time.

595
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Because my intimacy with you is not defined by a location.

596
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 It's defined by a relationship.

597
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 My intimacy with you is not defined by some band who plays well.

598
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 My intimacy with you is defined by the Word of God, my relationship with you,

599
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 my prayer life, how I open Scripture.

600
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 It's defined by so many other things.

601
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 I have seen you in the sanctuary, and I beheld your power,

602
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 but I have not made that my all and all.

603
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 I've also found you on my bed late at night when I'm anxious and overwhelmed.

604
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 I've found you in the darkest watches of night.

605
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 I have experienced your intimacy in all of my life.

606
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 That's what it means to commune with God.

607
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Then he says all these things.

608
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Now, I'm not going to call these benefits.

609
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 I'm not going to call these benefits of intimacy, because if I call them that,

610
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 some of you in this room will want to seek him for his intimacy for the benefits.

611
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 And as soon as we seek God intimately for what God can do for us,

612
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 we've missed the whole point, and I'm going to talk about that in a couple of weeks' time.

613
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 These are not benefits. Let me talk about these as fruits of intimacy.

614
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 These are things that are born in our lives as we find ourselves intimate with God.

615
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Very quickly, here they are.

616
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Things like, because you are my help, God helps us.

617
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 God comes and be with us.

618
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 He says, "I've hid in the shadow of your wings."

619
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 There's protection. That's one of the fruits of intimacy, the protection of God.

620
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Your right hand upholds me, feeling God is with us in the darkest moments.

621
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 When life is overwhelmed, it's a fruit of that intimate relationship with him.

622
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Those who seek my life will be destroyed, knowing that God fights battles for you,

623
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 that you cannot fight, that you'd be overwhelmed.

624
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Those are the fruits. It's like confidence. It's like assurance.

625
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 It's like knowing God is with you.

626
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Let me pull this together with a quick definition of biblical intimacy.

627
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 I would say it's this, an orientation of all of life that pushes beyond just the feeling of God

628
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 to an actual real and deep relationship with him that produces in us the fruit of assurance, confidence, and joy.

629
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 That's Psalm 63. That's, I think, how so much of Scripture speaks about the intimacy of God.

630
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 That's worth taking a photo of if you have a mobile phone.

631
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Because we're going to be digging into that a lot over not just these weeks, but this year.

632
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 As you're taking a photo of that, I wonder if the PowerPoint team, if you could jump back to that section earlier with the three questions.

633
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 This is also something I want you to take a photo of, and I'm going to finish with this.

634
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Will we continue to simply enjoy the atmosphere of God, or will we desire to move beyond this to deepen our relationship with the person of God?

635
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Will we continue to settle for lesser forms of intimacy to satisfy a longing that can only be fully satisfied by God?

636
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 And once we have found true intimacy with God, will we only long for ourselves to experience it, or will we…

637
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 Is there another slide? It's okay if there's not.

638
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Or will we invite others to experience it?

639
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Here's how I'll close, and we're going to pray. I've gone a bit long. Is that okay? Everybody all right?

640
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Here's how we're going to close.

641
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 This is why we're doing it in 2024, why God's calling us to intimacy.

642
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 2023 was about the Exodus. We spent a whole year pretty much on the Exodus.

643
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 And the Exodus is all about that idea of God calling us out of slavery into freedom.

644
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Why? We said it almost every week.

645
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Why does God do the Exodus with Israel?

646
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 So he can draw them together in intimacy, so they can be their God, and they can be his people, they can become a worshipping community.

647
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 That's what he said to Pharaoh, "Release my people, let them go, so they can worship me."

648
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 2023 was our Exodus. It makes sense, therefore, that 2024 God is calling you to intimacy.

649
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 You've gone through Exodus. Now is the time to draw near to God.

650
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 My prayer for you is that you will find your satisfaction fully in him.

651
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 My prayer for you is that he will challenge you to let go of some false versions of intimacy that you're holding on to.

652
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 My prayer for you is that you'll want to push beyond the great experience of Sunday morning here at the Vine,

653
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 and actually find a deeper relationship with him in your everyday life.

654
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 And through all of that, he will be glorified. Amen?

655
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 Could you stand with me? I would love to pray with you.

656
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 And maybe if you're comfortable, you can open your hands.

657
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 And I'm going to pray, and then the team are going to play.

658
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 And we're going to finish with a song of worship, which is designed to move us through the gates into God's presence.

659
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 Lord, I thank you so much for each person here.

660
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 Lord, I thank you that as we start the fast tomorrow, we start the fast with a passion for intimacy.

661
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 And Lord, we thank you that for the 21 days, we're going to get a devotion every day written by a congregation member

662
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 talking about their own intimate relationship with Jesus.

663
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 And Lord, I pray that the fast, I want to just pray over you right now.

664
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 And if you've not yet decided what it is for you to fast, that's fine.

665
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 You've got about 15 hours to do so.

666
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Lord, I want to pray that you would bless each person in this room with what it is that you're asking them to sacrifice,

667
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 to let go of, to lay down, so that they can move from the atmosphere of God to the person of God,

668
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 so that they can commune with you intimately.

669
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Lord, fasting is putting something aside to commune with you deeper.

670
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 Lord, I pray as we move into the fast tomorrow, that each person in this room watching online and our overflow

671
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 will be filled Lord, with your intimate connection as they sacrifice and lay something down

672
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 to start 2024 responding to your word, Lord.

673
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 Father, there are some people in this room that are going to need to repent in the next number of weeks.

674
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Lord, I know I need to.

675
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 And so Lord, I want to pray for your kindness that leads us to repentance.

676
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 And Lord, if there are people in this room that have been convicted by this word this morning,

677
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 I pray that they would bring that to you and respond and ask for your forgiveness.

678
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 And that they would start this year with an invitation to a deeper relationship with you.

679
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 Lord, as we talk about how we stop ourselves from being intimate, as we talk about alternative forms of intimacy,

680
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 would you speak to us Lord, each one of us.

681
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 And Father, ultimately, that we would grow to be the people that you have created us to be.

682
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 We're excited about this journey, Lord.

683
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 When you speak a word like this, it is always because you are doing it in love

684
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 to see your people become the very people you've created them to be.

685
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 I pray you would release this joy, release this excitement and expectation,

686
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 release your conviction and repentance over the Vine Church,

687
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 so that 2024 could be truly a year where we find you in new and fresh ways.

688
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

689
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 Everyone says amen.
