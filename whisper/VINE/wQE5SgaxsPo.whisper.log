[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Well, first of all, I just have to do a shout out for my husband,
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   who's unfortunately not very well.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   So, usually he's sat on the front row.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   He's not here, so, love you.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   (Laughter)
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Hello, everyone, and welcome watching online.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   So glad that we can pack everybody in.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   It's so good.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Well, you know, Christine Gardner works here.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   She leads our Psychotherapist and Counseling Center Oasis.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And she did a staff training for us a number of months ago,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   and it was on self-care.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   And one of the things that she said to us was,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   "You will have pain."
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Not quite what we were expecting for self-care,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   but she's right.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Her point was that life is full of pain.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   We cannot get away from it.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   When we understand that there will be pain and we accept it,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   we may not like it, we certainly don't have to want it.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   However, when we understand it will be with us,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   then our relationship with pain changes.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It then allows us, rather than to suppress and try and push away pain,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   it allows us to then think about how we can invite God
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   into the pain that we are experiencing.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   In the same way, life is messy.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   You cannot have a mess-free life.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   It just is the way it is.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And so we have to accept that there will be mess.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   But we learn that God is not unfamiliar or surprised by mess either.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   In fact, today we're going to look at how God can be actually found in our mess.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   In our second week of Advent,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   we look at the messy priest story of the birth of Jesus.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   We look at two characters in the narrative captured in the Gospel of Luke
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   who find themselves in deeply messy situations
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   and yet find ways to trust God despite the far from ideal circumstances.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   We'll look at how their stories relate to us,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   how they teach us that we too can find God in the messiness of our own lives,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   embrace that mess, and position ourselves for a hopeful future.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So of the four Gospels,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   only Luke begins with the story of the birth of John the Baptist.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And he introduces us to his father, Zechariah.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Now Luke tells us some interesting facts about Zechariah
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   to help us characterize the type of man that he was.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   First of all, his profession.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   He was very honorable.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   He was a priest, and he belonged to the priestly division of Abijah.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   His wife, called Elizabeth, was also of priestly descent,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   and they were both described as upright in the sight of God.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   We also learn that they were childless.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Scripture tells us that Elizabeth was barren,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and we knew culturally at that time there was a lot of shame and public disgrace
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   around not being able to have children.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And then finally we're told that they were old.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Well, actually, Scripture says that they were well along in years,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   which I think is a much better way of saying they were old, right?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   So next Luke leads us into the story by setting the scene in the temple.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   The priests bore the responsibility of serving in the temple,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   offering the sacrifice required by Mosaic law,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   acting as the mediators between the people and God.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And on this occasion we are told Zechariah had been chosen by Lot
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   to enter into the holy place.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   He's there to burn incense.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And the offering of incense represented the prayers of intercession
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   for all of the people, so it was considered a very sacred task,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and for Zechariah an opportunity of a lifetime.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   So while Zechariah was in the holy place, an angel appeared to him.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Now, understandably, Zechariah was afraid.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I think I would be too.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Even though, as a priest, he would have a sense of awe and trepidation
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   when he's serving, so that would be natural,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   but this was a fear much, much more.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   He was probably not expecting to encounter an angel on that day.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   But the angel goes on to declare a very positive and personal message to Zechariah,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   telling him that Elizabeth and his prayers to have a child were about to be answered.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So let's pick up the story in Luke 1, verses 13 to 17.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   When the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   "Your prayer has been heard.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   "Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   "You are to call him John.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   "He will be a joy and delight to you.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   "Many will rejoice because of his birth.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   "He will be great in the sight of the Lord.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   "He is never to take wine or other fermented drink,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   "and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   "He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   "He will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   "to turn the hearts of the parents to their children
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   "and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteousness,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   "to make readier people prepared for the Lord."
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Wow, what a message.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You can almost feel the excitement in the angel's declaration
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   that will ultimately prepare the way for the long-awaited Messiah.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   But unfortunately, Zechariah's response was not one of joy,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   but rather disbelief.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   So let's just take a moment to consider this.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So here is Zechariah. He's a Jewish priest.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   We are told he is a good, upright man.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   He's standing in the holiest, holy place,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   and he's carrying out the role of offering the prayers on behalf of the people,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   including his own very personal prayer, and he's facing an angel.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Now, Zechariah knew the Torah,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   so he would have been very familiar with the story
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   of how a heavenly visitation to another elderly couple
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   many years before, Abraham and Sarah,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   who also received a message that they would bear a son
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   who would play an important role in the story of God redeeming a fallen world.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Despite all of this, Zechariah lacked faith, and he doubted God.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   So we have to ask the question, why?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Had he become hardened over the years of praying for something
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   and waiting and waiting for that prayer to be answered?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Can we relate to that?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Was he over-familiar with the routine of priestly duties?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I wonder maybe sometimes we can become hardened to God
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   as our prayers appear to go unanswered.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Of course, we don't stop praying,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   but do we allow a little bit of disbelief,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   hinder us from truly seeing God,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   so when he does answer, we possibly miss it?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I think for some of us here that have been Christians for a long time,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   we can find ourselves appearing to trust God on the outside,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   carrying all the good duties of a good Christian,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   saying all the right things,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   and yet if we were really honest,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   we've allowed the years of unanswered prayers,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and with that, a disappointment in God to take root.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And if an angel were to visit us today, how would we respond?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Well, Zechariah's response was, "How can I be sure of this?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   I'm an old man. My wife is long in years."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Judging by the reply,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I don't think the angel was particularly happy about that response.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   The angel said to him, "I am Gabriel.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I stand in the presence of God,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and now you will be silent and not able to speak
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   until the day this happens,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   because you did not believe my words,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   which will come true at their appointed time."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Ouch.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   The angel is making a point.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   While Scripture records numerous visitations of angelic beings,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   there's only a couple of recorded references to their actual names,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   and here, the Hebrew name for Gabriel means "God is my strength."
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   The angel is leaving no doubt in Zechariah's mind
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   that he's been sent directly by God,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   reminding Zechariah of the power of God
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   and his promises that will be fulfilled.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And the consequences of Zechariah's disbelief?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   He's struck dumb.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   He's physically silenced.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   As Zechariah eventually leaves the holy place,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   all the expectant people and worshippers outside,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   no doubt wondering what on earth happened,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   they're met with silence from Zechariah.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   The greatest chance for Zechariah to do the job well,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   and he messes up.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And I imagine he went home with disappointment in himself,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   silenced not just by the angel, but with a deep sense of shame.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   So let's talk about shame.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   I think we underestimate the power of shame over our lives
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   and how it easily can hold us captive.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   According to Brené Brown,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   a respected professor, author, and researcher
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   for 20 years on vulnerability and shame,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   she says, "Shame is the painful feeling or experience
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   "of believing that we are flawed,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   "therefore unworthy of love and belonging.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   "It's the competing, conflicting expectation
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   "of who we are supposed to be
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   "and the huge weight of expectation we put on ourselves
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   "or are put on us by others."
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Shame tells us that we are not good enough
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   and we will never be good enough.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Brown connects the destructive nature of shame
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   to addiction, depression, aggression, bullying, suicide,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   self-harm, eating disorders, to name a few.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And the problem with shame is that it is often hidden.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   We don't talk about it.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   We keep it hidden and then we carry this weight
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   of self-judgment and then because of that,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   we get stuck in this cycle of negative behavior
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   that then leads us to more shame and guilt.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And as Christians, we are not immune to shame.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And I wonder if especially in church communities,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   the secret, silent, judgmental hold of shame
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   keeps us from being truly open and honest with each other.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Are we safe communities that allow people to be vulnerable,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   to share their stories without fear of judgment?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Well, scripture tells us very clearly,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   "Therefore there is now no condemnation
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   "to those who are in Christ Jesus
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   "because through Christ Jesus, the law of the Spirit
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   "who gives life has set you free
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   "from the law of sin and death and shame."
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   So if you are feeling the weight of shame,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   then today I want to encourage you to break the secrecy,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   the silence, your own judgment.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Talk to a trusted friend, see a pastor, a counselor,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   a community group leader.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Believe that because of Jesus,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   we can confess our failures and sins,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   know that we are forgiven,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   and shame has absolutely no hold over us.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And as a community, as the Vine Church,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   should we let's be less judgmental,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   stop the criticism, stop the pretense of perfection,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   and instead be known for our empathy,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   our love, and our grace?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Shame has no place in the body of Christ.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   When Elizabeth confirms her pregnancy,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   the shame that Zachariah had doubted
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   could have festered within him.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   However, we see that he makes the important decision
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   to choose to be vulnerable, to surrender and trust.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   So he decides to obey the angel's instruction
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   and he's surrounded by his community
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   when he names his son John,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   therefore declaring the hope in a future salvation.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And that shame, along with his silence, is broken.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And sandwiched in this story is another story,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   and this is the story of Mary, the mother of Jesus.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I love this painting.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   This is by the artist Henry of Sawatana,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   because while it's rich in symbolism,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   it captures the vulnerability and simplicity
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   of Mary in her surroundings.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Mary was a young woman, a teenager,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   in the context of the culture of that time of marriageable age,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   betrothed to Joseph, who was himself a descendant of King David.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And we're told that the angel Gabriel was sent to Mary.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   And when he appears, she too responds with fear,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   like Zachariah, but unlike Zachariah,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   her fear is followed by a surrender and a trust.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   So let's read from Luke 1, verses 30.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   "But the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   "'You've found favor with God.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   "'You will conceive and give birth to a son.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   "'You are to call him Jesus.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   "'He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   "'The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   "'and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   "'His kingdom will never end.'
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   "'How will this be?' Mary asked the angel.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   "'Since I am a virgin.'
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   "The angel answered, 'The Holy Spirit will come on you.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   "'The power of the Most High will overshadow you.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   "'So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   "'Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   "'She who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   "'for no word from God will ever fail.'
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   "'I am the Lord's servant,' Mary answered.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   "'May your word to me be fulfilled.'
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   "Then the angel left her."
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   The 15th century Franciscan priest Roberto Caratiolo
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   describes Mary's response to her encounter with the angel Gabriel
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   as this emotional journey from this sense of disquiet, of being troubled,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   to a reflection as she's listening,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   to an inquiry as she begins to question,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   and then to submission as she acknowledges she's the Lord's servant,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   and later as merit as she is blessed.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   But I think it can be too easy to dismiss the intensity of that moment
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and the range of emotions for Mary,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   especially as we, we're all familiar with her story.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   We're familiar with the outcome.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   But Mary, in real time, probably had no idea what the future would bring.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   She's described as being deeply troubled,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   even before the angel had told her what was happening.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Mary probably knew because of her ancestry
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   that being singled out by God was a fearful blessing.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   And for us, how often do we in the moment
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   find God's ways sometimes really overwhelming?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   We too are on this emotional journey.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   However, when we can look back, it becomes so much clearer.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   So as the angel delivered his message,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   despite the enormity of what had been shared,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   her humility and acceptance demonstrated a level of faith and trust in God,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   even that of beyond a priest.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   She was to be the mother of Israel's long-anticipated, long-awaited Messiah,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   and her life would be turned upside down.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   God's plan for Mary was messy and risky.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   The scandal for Mary to be pregnant and unmarried
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   exposed her to the rejection of Joseph.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   But as with all God's plans,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   he controlled the responses of those that mattered.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And in the case of Mary, Joseph became Mary's number one protector.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   And we read that Joseph accepted Mary after he too was visited by an angel
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   and trusted God despite the social stigma he would also face.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And I love that about God, how he works should be an encouragement to us.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   We don't face our difficult, complex, messy situations alone,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   and God is in control.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   I have heard so many stories of messy, difficult, complex, tragic situations,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   and I have heard how God has stepped in and people have encountered
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   that God is with them and in control.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   So what do these stories show us?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   That even in mess, God is at work and God is in control.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Mess for Zachariah was the failure to believe, his physical disability,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   the embarrassment from his fellow priests and worshippers,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   as well as the shame at having doubted.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Mess for Mary was being pregnant, unmarried, the social ostracism,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   the judgment, and possible rejection.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Sometimes our choices mean we are responsible for the mess.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   If Zachariah had chosen to believe instead of doubt,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   his story would have been very different.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   The angel was very clear in telling Zachariah that because he doubted,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   he would not be able to speak.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   But sometimes we have no control over the mess we find ourselves in,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   like pregnant Mary who had no control over the cultural response of that day
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and the rejection that could follow.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Just like the characters in these stories, whether we are responsible or not,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   we can choose how we respond in the mess.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   You see, Zachariah eventually chose to see God in his answer prayer,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   to surrender through obediently naming his son John
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   and trusting God as he declared his praise and thankfulness.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Mary chose to see God despite not fully understanding,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   surrendering herself and trusting God with an uncertain future.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Through both stories, we can learn that how we choose to see God in our mess
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   will lead us to surrender and trust and then hope in a future.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   So how do these stories become relevant to us?
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   A number of years ago, I worked for an organization
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   that provided funding for new companies
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   and injection of capital for those that wanted to diversify and grow.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   My job was to interview prospective clients and to prepare a business plan.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And then those business plans would then result in the funding being rejected or approved.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   So I worked for this company for about just under a year.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And during that time, got very close to all of my colleagues.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   It was a family-run business and so even outside of work hours, we would meet up.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Then just a week before Christmas, I arrived into the office
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   and I was told that the company had closed and I was to go home.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Then shortly, we found out that actually the company that had been operating
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   had no funding, there was no money, and it was now under investigation.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   And so I went home also being told that there was also no money to pay the staff.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And so a week before Christmas, we were told we would not get paid.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   It was a messy Christmas.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   I think one of the things that I really struggled with
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   was that knowing I had worked for a company for almost a year and I had no idea.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   And for me, I felt really embarrassed and I felt shame.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   I'd worked in a company that was responsible for ultimately causing a lot of pain
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   and difficulty for organisation and companies.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   And I had no idea. People had been deceived.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   There was pain and disruption in that.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And now I faced the harsh reality that also I was out of a job.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   I had no money, my husband Richard was studying at the time,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   and so we really didn't know what we were going to do.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   But even though I had a lot of questions,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   because after all, I thought God had provided this job for me,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   the reality was this situation was way out of my control.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   But I could control how I responded to it.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   So I chose to lean into God, to try to see him in all of this mess.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And I asked him a lot of questions too.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   I chose to surrender my fear, my worry and my shame.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And then I just chose to trust God that he was at work
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   and that he was the hope in my future.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Didn't make sense to me, didn't have all the questions answered,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   but I chose to trust God.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   It took about nine months before I got another job.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   During that time it wasn't easy.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And I remember we ate a lot of baked beans.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And if you're from the UK, you will know that is the staple diet
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   if you have no money in the UK.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   But even though it wasn't always easy,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   and sometimes fear would creep in,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   "What if I never get a job again?
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   What if nobody ever hires me?"
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   All of that, but I had to push through that
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   and keep on trusting that God was with me.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   So eventually I got another job,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   and that job turned out to be so much better than the other job.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   And eventually it would lead me to here in Hong Kong.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   But I had to learn an important lesson,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   that it was not about me getting a job.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   I had to learn that the security of my future
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   was not tied up in my work.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   The security of my future was in the redemptive work of the cross
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   that reconciled me back into a relationship with God
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   and then a hope in a future with Jesus
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   where there will be no more pain, no more death, no more sorrow.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   And this is the hopeful future that Zachariah and Mary saw
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   in the messages from the angel
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   that declared the ultimate fulfillment of the promised coming Messiah.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   So what is your mess?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And how do you see God?
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Because how you see God will determine how you surrender to Him,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   how you trust Him, and where your hope comes from.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   A hope that is not based on the changes in circumstances,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   but a hope that is in the future,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   because this life is temporary.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Our future is secured forever beyond this life because of Jesus.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   So the world may appear to be in a mess,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   complete disorder,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   but as the stories of Zachariah and Mary tell us
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   and as Scripture shows us time and time again,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   God is no stranger to mess.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   He actively uses it to demonstrate His power,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   His sovereignty, and His love.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   And honestly, the world desperately needs to see God right now.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   These needless wars raging around us
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   with so much destruction and devastation
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   and loss of life that is just not justifiable.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   The economic decline with rising poverty levels,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   global increase in anxieties and mental health disorders,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   and here in our city of Hong Kong,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   the alarming rise of young people's suicide or attempted suicide.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   The world needs hope.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Jesus is that hope.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Both Zachariah and Mary knew that the future was in the promised redemption
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   of their people through the Messiah, Jesus.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And they were to play the most important roles
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   in ushering in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   As Zachariah's son prepared the way for Jesus
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   and Mary gave birth to Jesus.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Jesus is the answer to our world's mess.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   But I can't help also wonder at the risk that God took
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   to have Jesus arrive as a baby,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   totally weak and vulnerable,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   dependent on his mother and earthly father,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   but also guarded by his heavenly father.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Because our God, our heavenly father, is in control.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   So how we see, to surrender and trust God
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   is how we live with hope.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   So what does that practically mean for us today?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Well, we may not be visited by any angels anytime soon,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   or you might, I mean I'm not saying you won't,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   but don't just rely on that.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   We can still see God.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   We see God through scripture.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   We read a lot about who God is and his character.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   As we learned in our Exodus series,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   God himself declares his character.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   He says, "The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   "and gracious God, slow to anger,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   "abounding in love and faithfulness,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   "maintaining love to thousands
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   "and forgiving wickedness, rebellion, and sin."
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   We see him through the incarnation of Jesus
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   and the life he recorded in the gospels.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   We see God in the world around us,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   the beauty of nature, the wonder of creation.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Paul refers to this in Romans.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   "For since the creation of the world,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   "God's invisible qualities, his eternal power
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   "and divine nature have been clearly seen,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   "being understood from what has been made
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   "so that people are without excuse."
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   And David also in Psalm 19,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   "The heavens declare the glory of God.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   "The skies proclaim the work of his hands."
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   We can see in creation around us,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   in the visible world, all that has been made by God
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   and his invisible power and divine nature.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   So take time to watch the sunrise or the sunset.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Take a walk in the mountains of Hong Kong
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   and see his splendor.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Stand by the sea and watch the beauty
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   and the power of the waves.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   See the beauty of the creatures.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   See God all around you.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And then as we grow in our understanding of who God is,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   we truly see him, our natural response will be
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   we will want to surrender our lives to him.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Now sometimes that's easier said than done.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   So how can we practically surrender?
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   What does that mean?
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Well first it has to take humility.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   We need to recognize and accept
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   we need God.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   His ways are so much bigger than our own.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   And one practical way that we can take time
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   is to regularly identify areas in our life
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   where we feel we're holding and struggling for control.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   And then confess your need to surrender to God,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   to surrender whatever it is and allow him to control.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Maybe it's overspending, overeating, drinking too much,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   challenging family dynamics, difficult work relationships,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   your job performance.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Whatever it is that you're desperately trying to control,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   bring it to God.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Create a habit where you regularly come in prayer to God
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   with confession and surrender.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Commit to growing your personal relationship with God.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Be committed to a more intimate relationship
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   that involves spending time in prayer.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Hang out with Jesus.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Allow the Holy Spirit to guide you.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Set some time aside that is away from distractions.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Go for a walk and talk with Jesus.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Sit and meditate on Jesus.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Whatever works, find something that works for you.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   It takes time and effort,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   but any meaningful relationship does.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   But it's worthwhile the investment of your time
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   because as you spend more time in relationship with Jesus,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   you will see God more and you will want to surrender more.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   You will trust more.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   So it's a healthy cycle.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Life is messy.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   So this Christmas, embrace the mess.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Choose to see God in the mess.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Choose to surrender despite the mess.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Choose to trust God with the mess
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   and you will know hope.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Can I pray for us?
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Please would you stand.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   (congregation murmurs)
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Father, I thank you for the honor it is to speak today.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   I just ask that my words would take root.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   The things that are from you,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   the things that you're wanting to speak to us,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   that they would not return void.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Anything that is not of you,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   then may it just disappear.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   But Father, my heart is that we would be a people
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   that chooses to have hope in you, God,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   because we desperately need to see you in the mess.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   I thank you for Jesus.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I thank you that he is our hope.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   He is our salvation.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   And Father, I want to pray specifically
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   for those that are really struggling to see Jesus.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   And one of the things that I sensed as I was praying
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   was that there is a spiritual blindness.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   You know, as Jesus went in the gospels
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   and many of his stories are around healing
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   of those that were blind so they would see.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   There's something significant about that.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   For us here today, for some of us,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   there's a spiritual blindness.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Some of you know that, some of you don't.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   And I believe that Jesus wants to heal us
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   of that spiritual blindness if you are willing.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   And so, Father, I pray in the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   that you would release people from this captivity
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   of spiritual blindness,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   that they would know what it is to see you, God.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   So much of this world overshadows us,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   puts obstacles in our way,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   but Jesus, would you remove all that
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   so you would be clearly seen.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   God, we need to see you
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   because when we see you, we will respond in surrender.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   And I pray for those here
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   that are choosing to surrender more.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   I ask that you would give them the courage
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   to sit with you to identify those areas
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   and trust you will be with them.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   And I pray for anyone who has experienced
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   that captive nature of shame.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And I break the hold that shame has over us
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   as a church, as a community, as individuals.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Father, may we respond with empathy towards one another,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   love and grace towards one another.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And would we be a people that is free
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   from the hidden shackles of shame.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Our future is in you, God.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   And it is a hopeful, bright future.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.840]   Amen.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:44.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
