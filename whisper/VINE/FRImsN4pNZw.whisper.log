[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   What are we gonna do with Bethlehem?
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.100]   Bethlehem is the great irony of the Christmas story.
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.500]   When we celebrate Christmas in our modern time
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.820]   and modern tradition, when we think of Bethlehem,
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.340]   I think it conjures up for us
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.280]   the perfect hallmark Christmas card nativity scene,
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.140]   doesn't it?
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.100]   You know, when we think of Bethlehem,
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.860]   we think of like perfect animals
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.360]   that never smelt bad in their lives, right?
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.160]   We think of like this beautiful manger,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.880]   this beautiful soft lighting on Mary and Joseph.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.640]   Mary just having given birth,
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.700]   but looking slim as ever, right?
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.240]   We think of Bethlehem as this calm and peaceful
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.240]   and holy and beautiful place where nothing could go wrong,
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.020]   where the angels gathered to sing Kumbaya forever.
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.960]   But Bethlehem, the real Bethlehem,
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.800]   the Bethlehem of the first Christmas
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.500]   was anything but like that.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.800]   Bethlehem itself was a forgotten town
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.520]   just about five miles south of Jerusalem.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.920]   Jerusalem, this incredible city of David,
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.600]   Jerusalem that had the temple,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.720]   Jerusalem, the place where you would expect
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.320]   the Messiah to come, not Bethlehem.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.120]   Bethlehem may be the birthplace of David,
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.120]   but it was just an outpost.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.400]   In fact, scholars believe that at the time of Jesus' birth,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.400]   there was only about say 20 to 25 families that lived there.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.040]   That's roughly about 180 to about 220 people.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.160]   It was a small little place.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.960]   And we know from the Christmas story
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.680]   that it was a place of a tight knit community
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.760]   that didn't like outsiders.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.620]   So when Joseph arrived,
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.060]   despite the fact that Joseph was related
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.240]   to most of the families in that village,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.540]   none of those families welcomed them.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.480]   None of the 20 to 25 families
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.520]   that could have opened their homes bothered to do so.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.360]   Why?
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.160]   Because they were not married
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.280]   and there's Mary pregnant out of wedlock
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.340]   and none of them wanted to suffer the shame
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.760]   of being associated with her,
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.900]   which really is ironic
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.680]   because Mary is carrying inside of her
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.120]   the hope of the world
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.880]   and Bethlehem essentially closes their doors to it.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.440]   So much so that they were born,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.000]   or Jesus was born in a cave,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.360]   not as stable as we often think of it
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.720]   in our modern celebrations.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.200]   I've actually been to Bethlehem
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.560]   and I've gone to the very place
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.500]   where they think Jesus potentially was born.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.600]   It's a grotto under the main temple,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.000]   the main sort of cathedral that they have there.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And that grotto is dark and it's cold
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.080]   and it's gritty and it's horrible.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.560]   It's not the place that any of you
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.120]   would choose your son to come into the world.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.340]   That's Bethlehem.
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.860]   The carol we just sung
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.960]   captures it quite profoundly and beautifully.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.320]   It says this,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.440]   "Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.260]   "as silent stars go by,
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.600]   "yet in the dark,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.680]   "the dark grotty gritty streets
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.860]   "shine of this everlasting light
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.960]   "for the hopes and the fears
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.520]   "of all the years are met indeed tonight."
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.160]   The hopes and the fears.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.600]   That's a great summary of Bethlehem.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.520]   The hope that was in Christ Jesus carried in Mary
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.360]   and yet the fears of a people
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.200]   gripped in the oppression of empire.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.960]   Bethlehem was dark and cold.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.120]   Mary and Joseph were rejected
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.580]   and shunned by their own family.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.960]   That's how the Christmas story actually begins.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.320]   And if all of that wasn't bad enough,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.580]   Bethlehem then becomes the one place
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.080]   of the greatest, most horrendous atrocity
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.200]   that is seen in the whole of the New Testament.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.940]   In fact, Matthew, as he continues his story
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.280]   about the birth of Jesus,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.920]   takes us into the reality of this atrocity.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.480]   It was a genocide.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.080]   A genocide happens in Bethlehem.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.160]   Let me read this to you from Matthew chapter two,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   starting in verse 16.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.320]   It says, "When Herod realized
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.240]   "that he had been outwitted by the Magi,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.400]   "he was furious and he gave orders
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.260]   "to kill all the boys in Bethlehem
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.820]   "and in the surrounding vicinity
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.920]   "who were just under the age of two years old.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.660]   "In accordance with the time
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.600]   "that he had learned from the Magi."
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.960]   You wanna know what the true Bethlehem Christmas story
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.780]   is about?
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.840]   It's about genocide.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.000]   It's about a group of people that rejected Mary and Joseph
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.240]   'cause they didn't wanna be associated
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.280]   with the shame of them.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.400]   And it's about the reality of weeping mothers
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.000]   in a very broken place.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.520]   Matthew tells us here that Herod,
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.800]   in a fit of jealous paranoia,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.440]   decides to kill all of the boys under the age of two.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.480]   Now, scholars generally would say
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.620]   that was probably only about 12 to 20 or so boys.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.960]   But if you were any of those families,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.400]   that was the world to you.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.920]   And Matthew wants you right in the midst
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.820]   of all of your, "Woo-hoo, it's Christmas time."
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.320]   He wants you to suffer the pain
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.080]   of the injustice of genocide.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.760]   Which really blows my mind.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.600]   And I wonder whether today,
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.120]   you might be able to also imagine what it would have been
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.240]   like to be one of the mothers of Bethlehem
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.600]   at the time of Jesus's birth.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.560]   Can you imagine if you're one of those mothers
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.440]   and you've spent all this time hearing about a decree
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.400]   that Herod has given,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.220]   and you're worried that one day,
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.860]   suddenly you're gonna hear it.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.880]   You're gonna hear the hoofs of the horses
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.520]   of the soldiers coming into Bethlehem.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.000]   And you know that that's the moment
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.680]   where your child might be taken.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.920]   And so as you hear the horses,
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.000]   you grab your child and you wrap your child up in a cloth
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.240]   and you tell the child to be as quiet as possible
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.800]   because you don't want the child to be crying.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.400]   And you try to shush the child
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.080]   and you put it at the back of the room,
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.640]   hoping that when the soldiers come, they won't hear it.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.720]   And then suddenly there's the knock on the door.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.760]   Suddenly you know that the soldiers are right there
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.160]   at the front of your door and you open the door,
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.120]   hoping that they won't hear the child,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.760]   but the child is still crying.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.200]   And so the soldiers come straight in.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.640]   They grab the child from you and you start to scream.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.040]   You start to wail.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.200]   You start to fight back.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.360]   You say, "No, not my child.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.800]   You can't take my child."
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.920]   And the soldiers storm out of the house
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.400]   and they slam the door.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:40.720]   And then you can no longer hear your child screaming
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.840]   and crying anymore.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.680]   You immediately know that he's gone forever.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.520]   Oh, sure, there are some angels that sing at Christmas time,
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.640]   but that's also the sound of Christmas.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.640]   The sound of mothers who lose their sons
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.240]   to the atrocity of genocide
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.800]   and the injustice of an oppressing empire.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.920]   I wonder if you could imagine what it would have been like
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.080]   to be some of those mothers of Bethlehem.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.160]   I like to call them the weeping mothers of Bethlehem.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.320]   Could you imagine how they would feel to know
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.400]   that the coming of the Messiah
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.760]   necessitated the death of their child?
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.920]   I wonder if you could feel
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.760]   what it would have been like for them to think,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.920]   "Well, if that is what the coming of the Messiah
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.360]   is all about, then that doesn't sound
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.000]   like a fair exchange to me."
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.360]   Can you imagine how those mothers would have felt
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   when they heard that God showed up in a dream to Joseph
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.640]   and told Joseph about the coming genocide
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.240]   so that Joseph and Mary could escape the death?
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.160]   Could you imagine the questions
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.240]   that might have sat on the mother's heart?
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.560]   "Why didn't God give us the dream as well?"
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:03.920]   And Matthew doesn't shy away from the reality
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.600]   of the hardness of these questions.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.040]   He doesn't shy away from the reality
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.200]   of what is happening in this story.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.000]   In fact, he could have just put it aside, couldn't he?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.280]   He could have just wiped away this part of history.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.720]   He could have said, "When I present the story of Jesus,
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.040]   I just want the angels, I just want the shepherds,
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.280]   I just want the wise men.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.120]   I want it to feel all nice and comfortable."
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.360]   No, he decides that he needs to mention the genocide
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.680]   'cause he's like, "I am not gonna allow them
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.880]   to sweep this under the rug of history."
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.560]   When Luke writes his story about the birth of Jesus,
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.400]   he doesn't mention the genocide.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.840]   And it's almost like Matthew is saying, "We will speak up.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.920]   We will know that this was also a part of the reality
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.360]   of the coming of the Messiah."
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.680]   And by putting it in his gospel,
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.920]   it's like Matthew is saying,
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.120]   "I honor those children that were killed.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.240]   I honor the mothers who are weeping
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.280]   because injustice is a part of our story."
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.560]   That we need to understand that when we come
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.040]   to celebrate the arrival of Jesus,
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.160]   it comes in the context of the most horrendous atrocity
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.560]   that you could imagine.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.040]   And it's like Matthew is saying,
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.920]   "This is what it means to be a Christ follower,
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.960]   that we recognize injustice and we do something about it,
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.320]   that we don't shy from the realities,
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.600]   that there is brokenness in the world,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.360]   there is darkness in the world."
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.640]   And if you wanna know what the Messiah is really about,
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.880]   it's about actually changing the injustice
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.920]   for the justice that he would carry.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.240]   Matthew would say,
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.720]   "Sit with the weeping mothers of Bethlehem
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.360]   and don't rush to the nice presence under your tree.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.960]   And feel a little bit of the journey
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.640]   that they would have gone through.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.680]   And understand what it is to carry the name of Christ,
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.200]   to be one who's willing to speak up
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.760]   for not just the weeping mothers of Bethlehem,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.800]   but now the weeping mothers of Hong Kong.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.720]   Be willing to stand up for the vulnerable
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.360]   and the hurting and the marginalized
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.280]   in our place at Christmas time.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.120]   To be able to say that there are things happening here
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.240]   that we're not happy about,
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.760]   that there are things happening here that are not right,
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.400]   that the voice of the church might rise up,
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.520]   yes, even at Christmas time,
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.360]   and say enough is enough.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.000]   Are we willing to sit at Christmas time
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.320]   with those who carry the scars of injustice
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.960]   and the burdens of brokenness?"
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.160]   And as I challenge you with that question,
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.040]   I want you to think about it.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.920]   And as you think about it,
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.240]   I want you to hear the justice cry
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.120]   of one of the most famous carols that we have.

[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.900]   The justice cries of Asaam saying,
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.740]   "We're mourning, we're in exile,
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.580]   and we need you to come, God, and liberate us.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.100]   Come, God, and change us."
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.540]   And Matthew, as he's wanting his people
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.980]   to sit in the reality of the genocide
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.420]   that happens in Bethlehem,
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.340]   he wants them to sit there because of what it will do
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.380]   to enable them to see the glory
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.100]   that is to come in Christ Jesus.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.800]   And in order to make this connection,
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.860]   Matthew does something
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.300]   that is perhaps unprecedented in history.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.940]   As his final connection to the Old Testament,
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.060]   Matthew takes Israel right back
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.540]   to one of the worst atrocities of their history
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.700]   to try to connect that to the current atrocity in Bethlehem
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.100]   in order that he might show them
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.180]   the powerful light of Christ Jesus.
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.340]   And I wanna show you how amazing it is and how he does it.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.700]   Let me show you this from Matthew 2, verse 17.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.820]   It says, "Then what was said
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.900]   through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled."
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.860]   So he's just told us about the genocide,
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.140]   and then he said, "This happened
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.700]   to fulfill a prophecy of Jeremiah."
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.780]   And here's the prophecy, "A voice is heard in Ramah,
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.620]   weeping and great mourning,
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.300]   Rachel weeping for her children
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.180]   and refusing to be comforted because they are no more."
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.260]   Welcome to the Christmas story.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.420]   I know you came to a carol service
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.860]   and you were expecting to feel warm and fuzzy,
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.100]   but Matthew embraces the reality
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.520]   that right in the Christmas story,
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.620]   there's weeping and there's mourning
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.980]   and there's Rachel who cannot be comforted.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.300]   And as you read this quote from Jeremiah,
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.900]   you're probably wondering how does this fit in at all
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.060]   to the reality of the joy that can be found in Jesus?
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:07.900]   Well, to understand that,
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.740]   you need to go back to Jeremiah itself.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.260]   Matthew's quoting here from Jeremiah 31, verse 15.
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.620]   Now, Jeremiah is a brutally difficult book to read.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.700]   I don't know if you've ever studied the book of Jeremiah.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.500]   It's not an easy book.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.620]   It's the kind of book that gets in your face
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.300]   about your sin and your brokenness.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.540]   It was a prophetic word that Jeremiah had for Israel
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.260]   at a moment of their greatest pain and suffering,
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.860]   where they were at the mercy of being attacked by Babylon.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.140]   And Jeremiah has a window of being able to say,
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.260]   "Hey, if you turn from your sin,
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.980]   if you turn from your brokenness,
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.100]   there can be hope for you again in the future."
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.820]   But he's pretty brutal with them
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.700]   about the stuff that's going on in their lives.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.800]   So Jeremiah is not an easy, fluffy read.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.140]   But verse and chapter 31 is the shifting point of Jeremiah.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.700]   In chapter 31 onwards, Jeremiah begins to speak of a hope.
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.300]   He begins to say that there is a new time and a future
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.940]   where God is gonna come and act.
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.420]   And in Jeremiah 31, he actually speaks about
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.980]   that famous idea that a new covenant will happen,
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.560]   that the old covenant was written on stone of tablets,
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.540]   but in time is coming where a new covenant will come for you.
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.100]   And that new covenant will be like the Spirit of God
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.140]   riding on the flesh of your heart.
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.760]   And he begins to say that there is hope for the future.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.420]   There is stuff that's gonna happen that God is gonna do
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.500]   that is gonna change your perception about who you are,
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.380]   about the world.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.340]   You're gonna have His heart in you, His Spirit in you.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.260]   It's a great chapter.
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260]   But before he gets all there,
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.260]   he roots them into this moment.
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.020]   And he says, "Do you remember Rama?"
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.120]   And he tells us about a place and a person.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.240]   The place, Rama, was one of the most famous places
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.660]   in Israel in those days.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.840]   And it was famous for two things.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.920]   The first is this, Rama was the place where Israel fled to
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.200]   just before they were taken into exile in Babylon.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.840]   Rama was the place where they gathered to mourn
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.740]   those that had been killed by the warring armies of Babylon.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.460]   Babylon had come in just previous to this,
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.960]   had actually torn down the walls of Jerusalem,
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.940]   desecrated the temple, and murdered and killed
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.760]   many of the Jewish people.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.320]   And the remnant of Jerusalem, the remnant of Israel,
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.480]   gathered at Rama, a small little town,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.240]   just about five miles north of Jerusalem,
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.740]   and they gathered there to weep for the reality
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.060]   that so many of their families, their relatives,
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.400]   and the people that they knew had been killed.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.320]   It was a place of great mourning, a place of great weeping.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.480]   It was remembered in their history as that moment.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.120]   Before the remnant is taken into exile,
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.780]   we met at Rama and we weeped.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.200]   It's also known for a second thing.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.700]   Rama is a very important place in the history of Israel,
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.140]   'cause Rama is the place where Saul was anointed
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.400]   the first king of Israel by Samuel,
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.940]   which is really fascinating, because Rama is honored
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.840]   and thought of in Jewish thinking
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.480]   as the birthplace of the kingdom,
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.800]   the birthplace of the line of kings
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.880]   who would eventually bring the Messiah
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.720]   through the Davidic dynasty.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.480]   All of that began in Rama.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.000]   So Rama is this incredibly interesting juxtaposition
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.560]   of weeping and worship, of a place of pain
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.460]   and hurt and turmoil, and a place of hope
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.720]   for the future coming of a king.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.620]   Then Jeremiah mentions a person, Rachel.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.360]   This is Rachel of the Genesis time.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   Rachel, sorry, put that there.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.280]   In case it catches fire.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.360]   This is Rachel.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.920]   That would be really dramatic, wouldn't it?
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.080]   We're talking about death!
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.880]   That's not planned.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.000]   If that happens, run.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.840]   Okay.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.540]   So, no, don't run.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.640]   All right, back on track, back on track.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.200]   Okay, so Rachel is of the Genesis, Rachel,
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.360]   second wife to Jacob.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.120]   Now, Rachel is an interesting character.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.560]   Rachel is mentioned here because of Rachel's life.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.100]   She actually died 1,000 years before Rama,
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.140]   before the events that took place at Rama.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.520]   But Jeremiah brings her to those events
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.000]   for a very particular reason.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.360]   Rachel's life was a difficult life.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.600]   She was the second wife of Jacob,
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.160]   but because she was the second wife,
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.840]   she actually wasn't attributed to
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.200]   or given the same kind of privileges
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.560]   as his first wife, Leah,
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.320]   even though Jacob loved Rachel more.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.360]   And when Jacob got married to Rachel,
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.800]   their great hope was that they would have many kids.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.040]   Their great hope was that they would be
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.600]   a father and mother, many children through them.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.360]   But Rachel was barren.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.480]   Rachel didn't bring any children into the world
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.560]   for many, many years.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.900]   And the whole time, Leah and her concubines
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.440]   were having lots of kids.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.680]   You can imagine the indignity
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.080]   of what it would have been for Rachel
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.960]   to desire children, not be able to have children
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.880]   for many, many years,
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.080]   and watch all of the other women around her
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.460]   having children with her husband, Jacob.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.520]   Well, towards the end of her life,
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.120]   she managed to conceive.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.480]   She actually has two children.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.560]   Joseph is her first, and her second is Benjamin.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.800]   Now, she actually dies in childbirth,
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.560]   giving birth to Benjamin.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.340]   She changes, in her last thing that she says,
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.580]   in her dying breath, she changes his name to Ben-Omni,
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.600]   which means the man of my sorrow.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.720]   And why is Rachel sorrowful?
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.840]   Why is she weeping?
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.280]   Because she had great hopes
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.240]   that she would be able to bring into the world
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   a lot of heirs for Jacob.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.280]   She had great hopes that through her
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.920]   would come a great nation.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.200]   And on her deathbed, as she's giving birth to Benjamin,
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.960]   as she dies, she's like, my lot has just been sorrow.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.140]   But God has a way of taking the worst expectations
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.880]   of our lives and doing something amazing through them.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.080]   See, God has a way of stepping into
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.520]   what we think are our failures
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.340]   and doing something tremendous.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.660]   Although Rachel would never see it.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.680]   For the centuries after the birth of Joseph and Benjamin
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.680]   would come the 12 tribes of Israel.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.840]   Joseph would father Ephraim and Manasseh,
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.800]   and they would go on to father the 10 tribes
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.700]   that would go up north eventually.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.960]   Whereas Benjamin would father all of the sons
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.880]   that were related to the two tribes,
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.760]   the Benjamin and Judah, that remained itself.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.240]   In other words, all 12 tribes of Israel
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.300]   came actually from Rachel.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.840]   This is why she was known as the mother of Israel.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.640]   This is why when Jeremiah speaks about the mourning
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.900]   that's happening in Ramah,
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.000]   speaks about the fact that the children of Israel
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.800]   had been slaughtered by the Babylonians,
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.240]   he brings Rachel into that picture,
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.560]   the mother of all Israel.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.200]   And he's like, it's as if Rachel is mourning
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.840]   for the death of her children right here in Ramah,
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.000]   and nothing can comfort her.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.600]   And when Matthew is thinking,
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.200]   what Old Testament prophetic verse can I bring forward
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.040]   to talk about what's happened in Bethlehem
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.240]   at the time of Jesus' birth?
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.040]   Oh, I know, it's Ramah again, it's Rachel again.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.240]   It's as if even now in the first century in Bethlehem,
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.040]   it's like Rachel is mourning
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.280]   for the children of Israel once again.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.040]   And why is she mourning?
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.680]   She's mourning for both personal reasons
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.360]   and national reasons.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.480]   Personal reasons because there's been death
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.360]   within her family, national reasons
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.920]   because the line of David must have been broken now.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.100]   If all of the children have been murdered,
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.600]   then surely the Messiah has been murdered, it's all over.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.480]   And Matthew is trying to make the point,
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.080]   it's just like Ramah all over again.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.040]   Can you feel it?
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.320]   Can you see it?
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:51.960]   He's like, do you feel Rachel's pain?
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.880]   Because here in Bethlehem,
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.840]   they think it's all over once again.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.600]   Now, I know you came to a carol service to feel good,
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:08.240]   but I want you to know
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.560]   that the story of the darkness of Christmas
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.200]   is where you will find its light.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.080]   If you really wanna know what Christmas is about,
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.360]   then you can't rush from the darkness
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.520]   and the pain of genocide.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.300]   If you really wanna see the light of Christmas,
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.040]   if you really wanna know what the true joy of Christmas is,
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.180]   it's actually found when you sit in the darkness for a bit.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.240]   I love the way actually that N.T. Wright puts this
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.800]   when he writes of Christmas, he says it this way.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.280]   He says, "Christmas is not a reminder
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.160]   "that the world is really quite a nice place.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.960]   "It reminds us that the world is a shockingly bad place."
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.880]   Christmas is God lighting a candle,
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.020]   and you don't light a candle in a room
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.480]   that's already full of sunlight.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.520]   And Matthew's trying to bring this painful moment
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.320]   of Israel's Old Testament history
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.660]   into this moment in the first century
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.160]   by sort of saying, hey, look,
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.200]   do you realise what happened here
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.800]   in the midst of the worst thing
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.460]   that we thought could happen to us?
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.800]   God lit a candle when it was so dark,
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.280]   when it was so broken,
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.440]   when even the children of our mothers were being slaughtered.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.280]   That's the time when God came.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.020]   That's the time when God showed up.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.080]   You wanna know what kind of God it is that you serve?
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.320]   You wanna know what kind of God it is
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.320]   that is to be worshipped?
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.480]   It is one who does not shrink back from injustice,
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.780]   does not stand back from brokenness,
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.880]   but one who actually moves into darkness to transform it.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.400]   That's your God,
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.360]   Matthew's saying in his story about the birth of Jesus.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.160]   He's saying, if you wanna know joy,
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:47.760]   see joy come out of the midst of darkness.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.900]   God left all of the comfort of heaven
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.320]   and joined the struggle on earth.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:02.400]   God came to the backdrop of rejection,
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.080]   loneliness, jealousy, and murder.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.660]   And that should set your heart on fire.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.120]   'Cause that means God can come and show up
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.880]   in our city when we need it.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.160]   It means that God can come and show up in your family
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.820]   when you need him to.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.700]   It means that if God chose a dark, damp cave
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.380]   to bring his son into the world,
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.420]   he can choose the darkness of your heart.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.420]   It means that he can move into the neighbourhoods
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.920]   where you need him to move into in your life.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.300]   It means that he can find you right where you are,
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.980]   right here and right now.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.700]   No matter how hard things are,
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.320]   no matter how broken it might be,
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.180]   no matter how difficult things might be for you,
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.980]   he can meet you in this moment
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.700]   and he can change and transform you
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.020]   and bring the joy of his life.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.780]   That's what Christmas is all about.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.900]   And you can't celebrate Christmas
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:54.360]   unless you see the light in the darkness.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.620]   Are you with me, church?
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:01.580]   Now, there's something quite profound here
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.600]   that goes beyond just what Matthew is doing
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.640]   and connecting a very painful time of Old Testament story
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.360]   to the painful time of Bethlehem's story.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.020]   If you go back to Jeremiah 31,
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:20.160]   although Matthew only quotes verse 15,
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.320]   it's actually verses 16 and 17 of that passage
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.900]   that I think Matthew has in his heart for his people.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.280]   I wanna read it to you from Jeremiah 31, verse 16 onwards.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.600]   It says this, this is what the Lord says.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.280]   "Restrain your voice from weeping
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.840]   "and your eyes from tears,
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.720]   "for your work will be rewarded, declares the Lord.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.320]   "They," speaking of the children,
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.780]   "will return from the land of the enemy.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.080]   "So there is hope for your future, declares the Lord.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.120]   "Your children will return to their own land."
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.400]   Jeremiah prophesies and he says, "It's like Rama again.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.680]   "It's like Rachel is weeping over the death of her children.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.680]   "It's like we think that this is the end,
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.280]   "but guess what, with God, there is no end.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.440]   "With God, there is always a new thing.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.080]   "With God, there is always a light
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.380]   "breaking into the darkness.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.660]   "Look, your children will return.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.960]   "The exile is not the end of Israel."
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.480]   Basically, Jeremiah is prophesying.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.840]   When you come out of exile, you'll come back to Jerusalem
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.040]   and you'll have generations going forward.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.980]   The Davidic line is not broken.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.720]   The Messiah is not dead.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.040]   Jeremiah is saying, "There is a hope for your future."
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.720]   And Matthew goes, "That's what I wanna say to Bethlehem."
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.520]   And he grabs this passage, he applies it to Bethlehem.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.440]   And he says, "This is the same for you too,
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.840]   "weeping mothers of Bethlehem.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.360]   "You think this is your end.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.280]   "You think the Messiah is done, but no, you just watch.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.160]   "He's gonna return out of Egypt.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.920]   "He's gonna live and teach and do miracles
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.960]   "and do all this stuff.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.840]   "He's gonna go to the cross and pay for your sin.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.120]   "He's gonna rise again into new life.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.200]   "It's all gonna happen.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.120]   "There is hope for your future," he's saying to his people.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.360]   You wanna know what Christmas is about?
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.200]   That's what Christmas is about,
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.640]   that there is hope for your future.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.920]   And then just like Jeremiah to his people,
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.240]   Matthew to his people,
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.000]   I wanna do this to my people and say over you,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.080]   "This is not the end.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.980]   "Whatever is going on in your life right now,
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.880]   "whatever hardship you might be suffering,
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.460]   "whatever thing might be taking place, it is not the end.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.780]   "God has not forgotten you.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.000]   "God has not given up on you.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.040]   "He is the light in your darkness.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.840]   "He is the one born into atrocity
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.760]   "and adversity.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.200]   "He is the one who flourishes the most
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.320]   "when things are difficult.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.080]   "He's the one who shines a light
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.320]   "and you don't need a light
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.040]   "when the room is full of sunlight,
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.600]   "but when you're feeling down,
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.720]   "when you're struggling,
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.080]   "when things are overwhelming, that's Christmas."
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.880]   That's a good story for us now.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.280]   And there's this amazing thing that it says here in Jeremiah.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.920]   He says this, he says, "Restrain your voice from weeping."
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.520]   Now on the surface, it sounds like he's saying,
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.120]   "Oh, just stop weeping."
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:57.960]   Like, why are you weeping?
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.280]   You shouldn't weep.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.200]   It's not what it's saying, okay?
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.680]   In the Hebrew, the word restrain there
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.640]   is actually the word that is better translated
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.280]   to be like retrain or reframe.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.480]   In other words, change your voice.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.800]   In other words, there is a season and a moment
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.960]   and a time where it's right to weep.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.680]   It was right for Rachel to weep over Rama.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.880]   It was right for the mothers of Bethlehem
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.720]   to weep over the loss of their children.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.140]   It's not like God was showing up and saying,
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.200]   "Ah, just get over it.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.600]   "It's not a big deal," right?
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.560]   This was a painful tragedy and Matthew sits in it.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.680]   God sits in it.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.500]   That's fine.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.320]   But what he's also saying is this,
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.840]   "When you know that the Messiah is with you,
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.380]   "it gives you the chance.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.220]   "It makes you in a time where you can now retrain your voice,
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.580]   "reframe your voice so that you're not just weeping,
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.480]   "but you're also rejoicing."
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.160]   So you're not just crying out for injustice,
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.000]   but you're also speaking up for freedom.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.740]   So you're not just walking in the darkness,
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.020]   but you're also singing about a light that has come.
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.000]   "Refrain your voice.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.980]   "Take your voice and make it sound something.
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.400]   "Align yourself to the light of Christ.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.660]   "Find the joy of Christmas welling up inside of you
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.320]   "and sing as loud as you can,
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.100]   "because even though the times are dark,
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.780]   "we will declare that he will return,
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.980]   "that he is coming back."
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.340]   See, there is joy,
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:28.060]   even in the midst of the hardest and darkest of shadows.
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.320]   It blows my mind to think that the one boy
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.760]   that escaped the clutches of Herod
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.680]   is the only boy that can comfort Rachel.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.740]   He's the only person who can comfort you.
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.040]   He's the only one who can birth that joy inside you.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.620]   That really is the message of Christmas.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:53.380]   He's the only one that can retrain and reframe your voice
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.980]   so that you're not just wailing and weeping,
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.380]   but you're also rejoicing.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.540]   I love that carol, "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel,"
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.380]   'cause it doesn't shy from Satan's tyranny.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.820]   It doesn't shy from the reality of sin.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.700]   That carol doesn't shy from the darkness of death
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.180]   or even from the reality of hell.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.540]   And yet at the end of each of those dark verses comes,
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.140]   "Rejoice, rejoice."
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.860]   In other words, retrain, reframe your voice
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.060]   so that you might actually speak of the beauty
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.060]   that is found in a light that comes in darkness.
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.340]   May you rise up at Christmastime.
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.300]   May you not shy away from the realities
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.780]   of the hardness of life and the brokenness of this world,
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.020]   but may it not get you down.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.540]   May instead you find the joy
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.740]   that is only able to be in you
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.100]   because Christ has come.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.540]   That's Christmas.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.040]   That's the promise of better days.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.300]   That's why we spent four weeks
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.140]   taking a look at the Old Testament,
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.780]   because I want you to feel and know and see
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.680]   the beauty of that first Christmas
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.420]   so that your rejoicing finds its profundity,
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.560]   even in your pain.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.820]   Can we rejoice?
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:10.800]   Would you stand with me?
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.860]   I wanna pray for you.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.440]   (gentle music)
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.460]   Maybe you'd open your hands as we pray.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.100]   Father, I thank you so much
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.580]   for the men and women in this room,
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.940]   for those online watching right now.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.660]   Father, I thank you so much for the power
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.380]   that there is in your story of birth.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.500]   Thank you, Lord, that Matthew didn't shy,
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.220]   didn't try to sweep an atrocity under its rug
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.340]   and pretend it didn't happen.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.940]   I'm grateful that he dipped into some painful moments
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.060]   of the Old Testament.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:46.640]   Showed us a woman who died thinking
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.340]   that her life had come to nothing,
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.100]   who you would then over centuries
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.100]   turn into the greatest of all people, your people.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:59.500]   And Lord, I thank you that the stories
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.860]   of the people in this room,
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.760]   though some of them may be quite dark,
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:10.300]   though some in this room may be carrying considerable pain,
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.100]   hardship, hurt, while each one of us
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.740]   understands the darkness of sin
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.380]   and the struggles that we can find ourselves in,
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.640]   we will rejoice.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:25.740]   We will find joy rising up in us.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.540]   And we know that as we exclaim your joy,
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:32.380]   even in the brokenness we're struggling with,
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.100]   that that is the message of Christmas.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:39.780]   Christ, come, Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.540]   Lord, I pray over each person here
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.380]   that as they celebrate Christmas this year,
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.580]   they would do so reframing and retraining their voice
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.100]   to be able to give you glory
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.600]   no matter what is happening for them in this time.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.480]   Lord, we worship you.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.260]   We honour you.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.540]   We love you so much.
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.540]   We have so much to sing about,
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.420]   so much to be joyful about.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.780]   We thank you that you're doing that here,
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.180]   right here, by your Spirit in this moment.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:15.160]   Rejoice, rejoice.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:20.380]   May your heart be afire for Christ.
