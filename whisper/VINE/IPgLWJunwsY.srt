1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
 Church, I wanna start out by asking you a question.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,980
 When was the last time that God asked you a question

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,720
 that totally floored you?

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,020
 A question that so completely caught you off guard?

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,920
 The type of question that just because He asked you,

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,780
 you already know what the answer is,

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,860
 but it still deeply challenges you.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,220
 Early one morning at a breakfast in 2012,

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,420
 God asked me one of those questions.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,100
 And as I was listening to the speaker that morning

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,500
 share his journey to faith, I was a 26 year old.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,380
 And as much as a 26 year old can,

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,460
 I thought I had a pretty good plan

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,700
 for the rest of my life, right?

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,340
 I was working in finance, I was dating the girl

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,540
 that was about to become my wife.

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,340
 And over the next 30 years, I had planned

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,540
 to build my resources, to build my relationships,

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,860
 to build my connections to a point that when I hit 55,

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,060
 I could turn that back around

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,900
 and invest it into God's kingdom.

22
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,700
 In reality though, I was sitting in that chair

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,220
 completely oblivious to the bomb

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,560
 that God was about to drop on me.

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,900
 Now, I had been shaping my plan

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,580
 for a couple of years at that point, right?

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,020
 It wasn't like the back of a napkin type of plan

28
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,660
 that you do when you sit down at a cafe.

29
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,460
 Now, I see I had a two year plan,

30
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,220
 and that two year plan was going to go

31
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,380
 into a five year plan.

32
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,660
 And that five year plan would then set me up

33
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,180
 for the 30 year plan, okay?

34
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,620
 I was pretty confident, it was the long game short,

35
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,340
 but God was gonna support this idea

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,840
 because I was doing it for Him.

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,380
 Now, the speaker at that breakfast,

38
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,620
 he and I had something in common, right?

39
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,560
 We both thought that the most impacting way

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,380
 that you could get society to see the church

41
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,740
 was to create something so extravagant

42
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,580
 that when they laid their eyes on it,

43
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,740
 they couldn't help but come running to the church

44
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,380
 to learn more about the God that we serve.

45
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,100
 That perspective is what made hearing the question

46
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,900
 that God asked me so much harder to hear.

47
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,140
 It wasn't just because it caught in a doubt,

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,500
 the plan that I had, it caught into doubt

49
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,280
 the actual purpose that I had, I thought for my life.

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,940
 Now, I expect some of you are probably thinking,

51
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,340
 what is that question that he's talking about?

52
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,940
 I'd imagine some of you are probably thinking,

53
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,060
 well, if that question has upended two people's lives

54
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,820
 already, maybe I don't wanna hear what that question is,

55
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,820
 but I'm gonna tell you anyway, all right?

56
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,300
 But I will say this, if there is any upending to happen,

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
 we're gonna do that together, all right?

58
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,060
 I won't take responsibility for it,

59
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,060
 but I will be with you as you walk through that.

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,140
 Does that sound good?

61
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,180
 - Yes.

62
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,820
 - All right, well, this is it, all right?

63
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,260
 This is the question that God asked me,

64
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,260
 which really has gone on to define over the last 10 years,

65
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,860
 what it means for me to live missionally.

66
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,420
 He asked me this question,

67
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,180
 "Nathan, would you be satisfied with me

68
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,860
 "if all I ever had for you to do in this life

69
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,660
 "was to love the person next to you?

70
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:15,420
 "If I stripped away all of the plans, all of the ideas,

71
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,260
 "all the desires that you have to change society,

72
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,700
 "to give people the opportunities

73
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,100
 "that you think that they believe,

74
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,220
 "would you still be satisfied with me?

75
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,740
 "Instead of the large-scale impact that you wanted to see,

76
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,780
 "you know, the unraveling of unjust systems that happen,

77
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,340
 "instead of like bringing large amounts of people to me,

78
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,260
 "if all I called you to do was love the person next to you,

79
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,020
 "would you be satisfied with me?"

80
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,340
 Church, I'm gonna be honest with you,

81
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,220
 that question hit me like a freight train.

82
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,260
 Yes, and everybody can just turn around

83
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,180
 'cause this is definitely not water.

84
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,020
 Thank you.

85
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,900
 It's the 11th, so if my voice goes,

86
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,060
 you guys are getting the best of it, all right?

87
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,860
 So I answered that question at that point in time

88
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,620
 because I figured, you know,

89
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,700
 that God already knew what was happening in my heart.

90
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,780
 There's probably a reason

91
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,060
 he asked me that question anyway, right?

92
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,980
 So I answered it as you should, with honesty,

93
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,220
 and my reply to God was this,

94
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,380
 no, I don't think that's enough.

95
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,780
 'Cause you see, in my mind,

96
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,420
 there was too much pain in society, right?

97
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,900
 There was way too much brokenness.

98
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,180
 There was too many people suffering

99
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,580
 from physical and spiritual issues.

100
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,580
 And the church, we as Christians, we had only just,

101
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,140
 we haven't even begun to grasp what it meant for us

102
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,140
 to be able to reach out to them and meet them in their need.

103
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,900
 Right, I believed that if there was 7.8 billion people

104
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,820
 on this earth, right,

105
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,540
 and if 31% of us identified as being Christians,

106
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,140
 and then I took a really conservative one in five

107
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,580
 of that 30%, that would give us 480 million people.

108
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,780
 And if there was 480 million people

109
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,420
 who honestly believed in the full authority of God

110
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,860
 and the power of the Holy Spirit,

111
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,180
 then we should be seeing on such a large scale

112
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,860
 of people's lives being transformed

113
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,180
 and society turning to Jesus by the masses, right?

114
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,780
 The church should literally be barnstorming

115
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,740
 across the world, knocking people out

116
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,540
 with the transformation that can only come

117
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,540
 through the gospel, right?

118
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,300
 That was the mindset that I had.

119
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,060
 And it was the mindset that I wanted the church

120
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,140
 and Christians to pick up, right?

121
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,500
 My career was about gaining the knowledge,

122
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,720
 the resources, the relationships,

123
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,020
 so that when I hit the halfway mark,

124
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,820
 I could arrive with all of my giftings

125
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,500
 and sew that into the kingdom of God.

126
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,700
 From my perspective, right,

127
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,180
 the world was yet to see what a truly dedicated Christian

128
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,060
 could achieve.

129
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,540
 And clearly, God had a lot of work to do on me.

130
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,380
 Right, three years later, God reminded me of this question

131
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,540
 as I was crying my eyes out on a flight to Manila.

132
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,320
 Earlier that day, I was sitting in a jail cell

133
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,960
 visiting a lady named Grace.

134
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,680
 Grace was being held in a small jail

135
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,880
 with about 250 other women,

136
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,240
 probably about the same size of the auditorium here.

137
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
 All right, these women were there waiting

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
 to have their cases heard before a court.

139
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,080
 They hadn't been trialed yet.

140
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,300
 They hadn't been sentenced yet.

141
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,000
 They hadn't been found guilty.

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,440
 All right, they had been arrested,

143
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,160
 either in the act of committing a crime

144
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,280
 or being under the suspicion of doing something illegal.

145
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,380
 Grace was one of those women who regularly visited

146
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,540
 by one of our missionaries that came from this church,

147
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,820
 Adrienne Ida Bell.

148
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,060
 Right, she was a single mother in her 40s,

149
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,940
 had three children,

150
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,440
 and had recently lost her husband to cancer.

151
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,900
 And she'd been living in that pretrial jail for two months,

152
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,500
 waiting to have her case heard in court.

153
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,800
 It was a messy and complicated situation,

154
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,000
 which only got worse for Grace.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,180
 About two weeks earlier,

156
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,860
 she went to the local hospital to get some scans done.

157
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,180
 And the doctors there told her at that point,

158
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,020
 "Grace, you have stage three breast cancer.

159
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,600
 Now, when you're in that situation,

160
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,660
 treatment options are pretty limited."

161
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,660
 All right, Grace didn't have the opportunity

162
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,820
 to go down to the local public hospital to get treatment.

163
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,240
 All right, she didn't even have the money

164
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,920
 to hire a personal lawyer, a private lawyer,

165
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,940
 just to get her court case brought up earlier.

166
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,820
 She was sitting in that jail cell,

167
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
 watching the days go by with a disease

168
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,340
 that would end her life without treatment.

169
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,140
 Now, Grace and I shared a connection at that point

170
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,860
 that rose above our circumstances.

171
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,420
 Our connection went above our languages,

172
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,620
 it went above our culture,

173
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,660
 it went above whatever law she may have broken.

174
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,140
 Because as Grace and I sat there in that overcrowded jail,

175
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,460
 with tears in our eyes,

176
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,200
 we connected to the very essence of our humanity.

177
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,620
 And responding to somebody who shares with you

178
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,700
 that they have just had cancer,

179
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,740
 that's not always an easy thing to do.

180
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,460
 But let me tell you, it's even harder when you,

181
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,580
 just two years earlier,

182
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,140
 had the doctors say those same words to you,

183
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,780
 "Nathan, you have cancer."

184
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,840
 On the flight out of Iloilo that night,

185
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,680
 as soon as the catalysts went off,

186
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,820
 I broke down in tears and I grieved for Grace.

187
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,780
 For the fact that she was facing the same uncertainty,

188
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,780
 the same questions without answers,

189
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,460
 the same fear that I did,

190
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,300
 but with the very real probability

191
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,060
 that unless something significantly changed

192
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,060
 in the system that she was caught within,

193
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,260
 that with each day,

194
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,220
 that sentence was going to become more and more likely

195
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,900
 to be a death sentence for her.

196
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,940
 Her experience broke me,

197
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,940
 because even though we shared that cancer journey,

198
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,260
 it completely contrasted my own.

199
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,780
 My journey with cancer was relatively short-lived.

200
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,420
 It only took a week between the diagnosis

201
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,660
 to when I was in the hospital getting the tumor removed.

202
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,540
 And I received that amazing treatment

203
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,900
 for no other reason than the fact

204
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,140
 that I was born in a privileged country

205
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,780
 that had fair access to health services.

206
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,780
 So that night, I got pulled back to the question

207
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,300
 which God has used to literally shape my understanding

208
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,220
 of what it means to live missionally.

209
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,380
 If all I ever had for you

210
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,060
 was to love the person next to you,

211
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,580
 the person like grace,

212
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,020
 would you be satisfied?

213
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,660
 Now, I'm going to make a guess

214
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,500
 that this probably isn't the typical perspective

215
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,780
 that you'd expect to hear on a Sunday morning

216
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,300
 about missions, right?

217
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,260
 'Cause missions is normally about that external activity.

218
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,820
 The activity where we take our resources,

219
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,420
 we take our time, we take our experience,

220
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,540
 and we go somewhere to do something,

221
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,300
 the physical action out there.

222
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,380
 But I wanted to pick up this question today

223
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,900
 because what God has shown me since that breakfast is this.

224
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,700
 If we aren't able to internalize

225
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,980
 what it means to us personally,

226
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,660
 then we will always struggle to know the difference

227
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,180
 between doing missions and then living missionally.

228
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,740
 Right, so I want to take a few minutes

229
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,900
 just to break down that question.

230
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,780
 Is that all right?

231
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,620
 Good.

232
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,780
 Good, so let me ask you a question then.

233
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,780
 Where are you finding your satisfaction right now?

234
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,380
 Most of us probably approach that question

235
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,060
 from the perspective of how are my desires being fulfilled?

236
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,940
 Right, that's the narrative we experience

237
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,420
 most commonly around us,

238
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,540
 the desire to satisfy our personal needs,

239
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,660
 which includes how we expect people

240
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,860
 to see and react around us, right?

241
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,460
 Satisfaction is about fulfilling

242
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,100
 what feels right and good to me.

243
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,260
 And over the coming days,

244
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,980
 if you think through this question,

245
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,700
 I want to give you a little bit of an insight.

246
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,940
 The answers that start to come out from this

247
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,100
 will be really, really helpful

248
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,820
 when it comes to your relationship with God

249
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,980
 because you'll start to see some of those underlying motives

250
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,540
 that really drive our desires, right?

251
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,660
 Because the source of our satisfaction,

252
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,900
 that is so important because where it comes from

253
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,460
 is where we turn to satisfy ourselves, right?

254
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,460
 And wherever we get our satisfaction from

255
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,900
 is what we would desire the most.

256
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,660
 And whatever we desire the most

257
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,820
 is what shapes our actions, right?

258
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,340
 Source of satisfaction, forming our desires,

259
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,700
 shaping our actions.

260
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,100
 And in the context of missions,

261
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,180
 this process is what determines

262
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,580
 whether we are building God's kingdom

263
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,900
 or our own idea of what that should be, right?

264
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,380
 And you can probably start to see the problem

265
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,900
 with the perspective that I shared with you earlier, right?

266
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,260
 'Cause I was looking for satisfaction in the extravagance.

267
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,620
 Right, I wanted to build a kingdom

268
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,900
 that yes, it reflected elements of God,

269
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,820
 but it also looked a lot like what Nathan thinks is right.

270
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,020
 Right, and without that hard turnaround by God,

271
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,060
 my actions were going to end up driving me

272
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,780
 further away from his heart

273
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,940
 and that desire to love the person next to me.

274
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,740
 Now, I want you to see something in this, right?

275
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,140
 'Cause this process is not just my personal interpretation

276
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,020
 of an experience that I had, right?

277
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,460
 Because we also find the same thing in scripture, right?

278
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,420
 And I'm gonna show you this to you

279
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,780
 in the first five verses of Isaiah 55.

280
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,220
 I'm gonna read through this, but as I do it,

281
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,860
 I want you to pay special attention

282
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,780
 to the way that he describes this process

283
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,940
 of finding satisfaction, aligning desires,

284
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,300
 and the resulting actions that come from it.

285
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,780
 Okay, let's go from verse one.

286
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,260
 "Come all who are thirsty, come to the waters,

287
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,980
 and you who have no money, come buy and eat.

288
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,220
 Come buy wine and milk without money and without cost.

289
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,500
 Why spend money on what is not bread

290
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,180
 and your labor on what does not satisfy?

291
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,100
 Listen, listen to me and eat what is good,

292
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,700
 and you will delight in the richest of fair.

293
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,420
 Give ear and come to me.

294
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,100
 Listen that you may live,

295
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,500
 and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,

296
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,780
 my faithful love promised to David.

297
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,060
 See how I've made him a witness to the peoples,

298
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,300
 a ruler and a commander of the peoples.

299
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,100
 Surely you will summon nations you know not,

300
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,060
 and the nations you do not know will come running to you

301
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,980
 because of the Lord your God."

302
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,140
 In this passage, Isaiah is showing us

303
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,500
 that if we trust God, we will seek our satisfaction in him.

304
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,020
 And in that process of doing that,

305
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,980
 our desires become more and more aligned with him,

306
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,060
 which eventually forms the direction for our lives,

307
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,060
 which is so much more important

308
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,620
 than just a well-thought-out strategy plan, right?

309
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,820
 It opens up the opportunity to follow God,

310
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,140
 to be satisfied in him,

311
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,940
 and to live that missional lifestyle

312
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,540
 by being a witness to the people around us.

313
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,980
 So if we believe that mission is about this, right?

314
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,140
 If we believe it is about living our lives

315
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,740
 in a way that reflects God's intention

316
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,340
 and purpose for creation,

317
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,300
 then we have to recognize that this is only possible

318
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,460
 by walking in partnership with him.

319
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,100
 Out of that intimacy,

320
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
 we have the opportunity to point others

321
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,380
 towards a relationship with the creator

322
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,420
 and to influence the systems of injustice.

323
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,780
 But we can only do that underneath the sovereignty of God.

324
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,020
 And what I love about this is the reflection that it has

325
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,260
 with Jesus's ministry here on earth as well, right?

326
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,220
 When Jesus, he gave us these examples of a special place

327
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,740
 which we should inhabit as being part of the vine, right?

328
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,500
 He called us to remain into that place

329
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,220
 because without being connected to him,

330
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,140
 not only do we lose our ability to impact the world around us

331
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,380
 through the leading of the gospel,

332
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,540
 but we will over time inevitably find a gap growing

333
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,020
 between our desires and his, right?

334
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,060
 Having our satisfaction anchored in him

335
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,820
 is what we need to build healthy relationships with others

336
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,220
 then that those relationships

337
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,060
 should then stretch beyond our ideas.

338
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,980
 And that's important because if you're like me,

339
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,820
 if I'm not anchored in that satisfaction with God,

340
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,460
 holding onto it is something

341
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,220
 which it becomes extremely difficult, right?

342
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,820
 I wrestle with how this plays out in my life.

343
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,300
 You know, the desire that I have to do more,

344
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,340
 to produce greater impact, right?

345
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,260
 To scale up the kingdom of God.

346
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,420
 And the problem that happens is when we let go

347
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,380
 of that anchor, you start to see exactly what happened

348
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,680
 in my terrible statistical analysis

349
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,180
 of the world population earlier, right?

350
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,860
 I'm buying into my methods.

351
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,900
 I'm trying to leverage of my good ideas,

352
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,760
 my good intentions, the opportunities to influence people,

353
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,740
 but it becomes a very slippery slope

354
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,540
 away from Jesus himself.

355
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,220
 When we find more satisfaction in doing things for him

356
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,840
 as opposed to spending our time with him, right?

357
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,600
 So for us to liberate people,

358
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,820
 if we want to tear down the systems

359
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,420
 that oppress and enslave people,

360
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,620
 we need to have a systematic response.

361
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,300
 Absolutely, right?

362
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,620
 But it has to come with the transformation

363
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,600
 of the heart and the mind of the believer.

364
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,900
 Because even if, even if the 480 million people, right?

365
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,420
 If we all got together and we put our heads down

366
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,140
 and we did some good things, right?

367
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,060
 We did some really good things.

368
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,260
 I would say this, at the very best,

369
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,940
 that would be an incredible social movement,

370
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,740
 but it would run the risk of losing the actual spirit

371
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,180
 and the purpose behind it, what actually started.

372
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,620
 I want to give you an example

373
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,240
 of what this could look like, right?

374
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,700
 One of the pathways that Michelle mentioned earlier

375
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,860
 was the idea of creation care, right?

376
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,100
 Creation care being in essence,

377
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,220
 you're looking after God's creation, right?

378
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,660
 And taking responsibilities

379
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,700
 for either the way that we protect it

380
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,060
 or the way that we pollute it, right?

381
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,880
 This year, if you looked around the Vine Center,

382
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,620
 you have seen a couple of those little

383
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,460
 recycling bins pop up, right?

384
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,540
 That came out of an intentional decision

385
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,760
 that we took as a church

386
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,180
 to align where we found our satisfaction

387
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,660
 in the space of caring for God's creation.

388
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,360
 And it spilled over into the way

389
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,100
 that we do this as a staff as well, right?

390
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,980
 For our staff, each week, we save our paper,

391
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,620
 our plastics, our metals, and our glass.

392
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,300
 And then we bring it in to recycle

393
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,500
 with our partner, Hong Kong Recycles, right?

394
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,840
 That transformation started in our hearts.

395
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
 And now that conviction of the Holy Spirit,

396
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,820
 it has the potential to change society around us.

397
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,580
 And that's the important part about this, right?

398
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,460
 Because if we took this as a church,

399
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,100
 imagine if the Vine did this collectively, right?

400
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,960
 We didn't just recycle individually.

401
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,200
 We took it to our church.

402
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,060
 I'd sort of, we're already at your church.

403
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,580
 If you took it to your business,

404
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,060
 if you took it to your school,

405
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,360
 if it took to the facilities,

406
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,820
 the complexes that we live in,

407
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,660
 and we all started to recycle,

408
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,640
 that has the foundations to be growing

409
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,540
 into something which is so much more.

410
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,380
 And the thing that I love about that,

411
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,740
 when it comes to this idea of evangelizing,

412
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,900
 you cannot find an easier platform

413
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,900
 to sharing why your faith is so important to you

414
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,020
 than through this type of engagement, right?

415
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,060
 I do this because of my faith.

416
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,260
 I do this because I care of the environment.

417
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,880
 You'll remember from the Alternative Society

418
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,600
 that this is the exact process

419
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,420
 that Paul was teaching the church in Philippi, right?

420
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,260
 By aligning our desires with the greater good

421
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,100
 of the advancement of the gospel

422
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,660
 and following God wherever he leads us,

423
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,700
 we will find the joy in that space

424
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,620
 as we discover opportunities to lead people around us

425
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,700
 into a deepening relationship with their creator.

426
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,900
 Okay, I think you've got the point, right?

427
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,300
 I've shared a little bit about that process in my life.

428
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,460
 We've unpacked it a little bit within scripture.

429
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,580
 But what I wanna do now is I wanna bring this back

430
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,900
 to the space where we are right now.

431
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,640
 I wanna bring this back to you.

432
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,260
 There's a second part to that question

433
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,540
 that I asked you earlier, right?

434
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,500
 The second part of this was love the person next to you.

435
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,200
 One of the things that Michelle and I love

436
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,500
 about being on the missions team

437
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,960
 is the opportunity that we get along

438
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,540
 to come alongside of you

439
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,740
 and walk out the journey that God has for you, right?

440
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,200
 And we actually designed our approach to missions

441
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,620
 with that in mind, right?

442
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,780
 We wanted to equip our church to be informed

443
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,180
 and resourced to live out their faith

444
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,820
 in the areas that they are passionate about.

445
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,420
 We do that through our pathways.

446
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,540
 We do that through our partnerships that we have.

447
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,660
 But we also do that by walking that out

448
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,100
 with you personally, right?

449
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,060
 In discovering what your missional response can be.

450
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,380
 And that's important for us because the reality is

451
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,120
 that the journey that you are on is deeply personal, right?

452
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,740
 It's shaped by your skills.

453
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,020
 It's shaped by your experiences, your passions, right?

454
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,180
 It's the personal connection that you have

455
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,940
 to the missional expression which makes it so important.

456
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,900
 It's the reason why living missionally in your neighborhood

457
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,740
 in the area that you do, your job that you have,

458
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,400
 while you attend this church,

459
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,180
 even the relationships that you have,

460
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,920
 they all become connections on what it means

461
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,040
 to love the person next to you, right?

462
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,280
 We have the opportunity to walk alongside of you

463
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,120
 in this area.

464
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,700
 However, we certainly don't have all the answers

465
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,620
 on what it means to be living missionally.

466
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,700
 And a significant reason for that

467
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,600
 is because there's a collective response involved, right?

468
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,140
 We come together as a community,

469
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,340
 as a community that we do like every Sunday

470
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
 in our community groups during the week,

471
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,500
 when you're in your workplace

472
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,020
 and you're having some of those sort of connections

473
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,940
 with other believers,

474
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,060
 that community is a part of what it means

475
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,860
 to be supporting, releasing,

476
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,060
 and encouraging us to live out our faith.

477
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,540
 So my hope for you today is this.

478
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,080
 Even though I don't know your context,

479
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,380
 I don't know the relationships that you're in,

480
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,060
 my hope is that this opportunity that we have right now

481
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,660
 could be a moment where God gives you the insight

482
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,340
 into who he's calling you to love.

483
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,660
 And that's what we're gonna do.

484
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,980
 We're gonna create a space for this

485
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,580
 over the next few minutes,

486
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,380
 to take that step together as a community.

487
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,260
 I've invited several people to come and pray over us today,

488
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,460
 people whose voices represent

489
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,660
 four different spheres of influence

490
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,020
 that we all interact.

491
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
 Okay, I'm gonna ask you to bring up

492
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,920
 that four sections there on the slide.

493
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,900
 Right, we're looking at places like the workplace.

494
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,020
 So this is for people who are

495
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,020
 in an active employment form, right?

496
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,780
 An opportunity to find where you can express God,

497
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,540
 your faith in that particular space.

498
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,660
 We have an area which we're gonna look at family, right?

499
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,860
 For either your family or a family

500
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,760
 that you're living with, a family that you care for.

501
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,500
 We're gonna look at the next generation,

502
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,700
 the students and youth in our city.

503
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,180
 And then also the Hong Kong community.

504
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,100
 The broader sense of what it means

505
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,900
 to be living in this city and living missionally as well.

506
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,520
 Right, we chose these areas

507
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,420
 because every one of us has an interaction

508
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,820
 with at least one of them, right?

509
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,120
 And I'm gonna give you 10 seconds right now

510
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,740
 just to look at these and to choose one

511
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,260
 that most closely resonates with you.

512
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,380
 It doesn't have to be a sense of calling,

513
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,180
 but it is going to be a sphere

514
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,980
 where you're uniquely positioned

515
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,480
 to influence and live out the gospel.

516
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:15,700
 Instead of having myself

517
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,980
 or one of our pastoral teams do this,

518
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,020
 we've actually invited a number of different people

519
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,460
 from our community to pray that prayer of encouragement

520
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,500
 and releasing over you as you go to interact

521
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,820
 with people across those communities.

522
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,460
 And to me, that's important

523
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,060
 because this is the same people

524
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,980
 who bring the perspective that you carry, right?

525
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,060
 They're the people who have the same circumstances

526
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,020
 that you're involved with, the same opportunities.

527
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,260
 So I'm gonna ask them to come and join me at the moment.

528
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,580
 The first I'm gonna do is actually invite Tim to join us

529
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,100
 to pray over the workplace.

530
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,940
 And what we're gonna do, how this is gonna work is this.

531
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,060
 If the workplace is an area which you feel called to,

532
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,620
 I'm gonna ask you to stand up, right?

533
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,140
 Tim is gonna pray over you.

534
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,660
 But at the end of that prayer,

535
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,660
 as we go into the next sections, don't sit down yet, right?

536
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,820
 I want you to stay standing.

537
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,620
 And as somebody stands up around you,

538
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,220
 I want you to turn to them and join us in prayer as well.

539
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,940
 Join us in prayer and what it means

540
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,100
 to be living missionally,

541
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,140
 to be able to love the person next to us, okay?

542
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,340
 And while we're doing this, if God gives you something,

543
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,900
 if He gives you a person, if He gives you a people group,

544
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,820
 if He gives you an action that He wants you to do

545
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,940
 in response, I want you to feel the freedom

546
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,820
 to take out your phone, to take out your notepad,

547
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,620
 and just make note of one thing that you could be doing

548
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,740
 over the next week in response to that, okay?

549
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,580
 So for the people in that particular space with workplace,

550
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,340
 I'm gonna ask you to stand now

551
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,340
 and Tim's gonna pray for you.

552
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,920
 (gentle music)

553
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:52,420
 - All right, let's pray.

554
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,460
 Father God, as someone who spends a lot of time at work,

555
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,580
 I lift up all of the people who are standing here,

556
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,940
 who have always been busy with super packed schedules

557
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,580
 and taking a lot of responsibilities in their duties.

558
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,860
 We sometimes focus fully on our work

559
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,700
 and forget about the purpose of life.

560
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,340
 We may not spend enough time with our families and friends

561
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,380
 to manage our health, and the most important thing,

562
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,760
 we don't have enough time to spend with you.

563
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,340
 God, I pray that you bring peace to our work

564
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,380
 and let you be the center of our lives.

565
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,860
 I pray for your blessing to let us be a channel

566
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,760
 of God's peace in our workplace.

567
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,420
 I pray for your courage and boldness

568
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,660
 to fill those stress, anxiety, and difficulties

569
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,420
 we are all facing at our work.

570
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,360
 Help us not to be afraid, leading by examples on our fields

571
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,980
 in both of our performances

572
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,680
 and sharing great testimonies of your grace.

573
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,900
 I pray that all of you are filled with God's love

574
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,380
 and presence at your workplace.

575
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,140
 May you use all of us as a great tool

576
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,500
 to shine in between all of our coworkers,

577
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,340
 seniors, juniors, clients, and customers.

578
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,380
 Thank you that you are the ultimate father in our workplace.

579
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,700
 In your name we pray, amen.

580
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,540
 - Thank you, Tim.

581
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,940
 I'm gonna ask the people who feel like

582
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,620
 that sphere of influence that you wanna respond to

583
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,580
 is the family section, just to stand up now.

584
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,340
 And we're gonna be joined by Melanie to pray over that.

585
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,220
 - Heavenly Father, we lift up those fathers

586
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,960
 who are employed and spend a lot of time in the office.

587
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,700
 Lord, we pray that you would help them

588
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,580
 and give them wisdom on how to balance their time

589
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,860
 between work and families,

590
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,180
 that they will trust you for their provision.

591
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,260
 It is your will for families to grow in love

592
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,660
 toward one another, that you would enable them

593
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,660
 to be strong and courageous,

594
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,820
 no matter what circumstance themselves in.

595
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,080
 Help them not to be afraid, but to stand in the fight

596
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,660
 and put their trust in you, God.

597
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,020
 I bless you to be a safe place in your family,

598
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,980
 that you would walk in God's blessings and goodness,

599
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,700
 and that the glory of God shine upon you.

600
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,780
 I bless you to be a channel of God's peace in Hong Kong.

601
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,300
 I pray, Lord, for the release of your grace on them

602
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,100
 and in their families in a new measure

603
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,140
 from this day forward for your glory.

604
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,480
 Father, we lift up all the moms

605
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,560
 who brought us up in your love and grace.

606
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,240
 Give them wisdom and understanding

607
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,700
 in all the things they face,

608
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,120
 and that their hearts will be knitted together in love

609
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,220
 for their husband, children, and other family members.

610
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:55,260
 Father, we pray for the children as well.

611
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,340
 We declare that they belong to you,

612
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,360
 that they would fear you,

613
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,260
 place in their hearts a desire to love you,

614
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,380
 know you, and live for you, God.

615
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,400
 Help every parent to train their children

616
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,980
 in the way they should go according to your word.

617
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,120
 Thank you, God, that you are our ultimate father

618
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,660
 to all families.

619
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,220
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

620
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,440
 - Thank you, Melanie.

621
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,860
 I'm gonna ask Fran to come

622
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,200
 and a prayer over the Hong Kong community.

623
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,660
 For people here in the city,

624
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,180
 you have an opportunity to respond to the needs

625
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,540
 that exist, would you please stand with us now?

626
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,000
 - Dear Lord Jesus,

627
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,660
 as we reflect on missions and outreach today,

628
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,660
 we ask you to give us a passion for your great commission.

629
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,380
 Open our spiritual eyes, Lord,

630
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,260
 to see the needs you see,

631
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,540
 to be your hands and feet,

632
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,700
 your words, and your love to our family,

633
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,140
 our neighbors, our colleagues, our classmates,

634
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,600
 our friends, our street cleaners,

635
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,700
 the cashier at the store,

636
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,540
 the stranger on the MTR, and more.

637
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,580
 Give us compassionate hearts, Lord,

638
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,900
 and a love that comes from you,

639
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,120
 because our love is inadequate.

640
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,780
 Empower and equip us with the gifts of your spirit, Lord,

641
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,780
 to reach out to every corner of Hong Kong

642
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,840
 and the rest of the world.

643
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,980
 Give us a burden for those who do not yet know you,

644
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,700
 and give us courage and boldness to step out in faith,

645
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,980
 to share your love and salvation with them.

646
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,860
 Speak to each one of us here today, Lord.

647
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:53,340
 Open our eyes and hearts to a spiritual awareness

648
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,660
 of those who are in need of you.

649
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,320
 Let us not be afraid of our inadequacies,

650
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,980
 because it is not our efforts or abilities.

651
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,980
 Your promise to us is that as long as our hearts are willing,

652
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,040
 you will step alongside us to reap the harvest.

653
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,420
 So place the desire in us, Lord.

654
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,580
 Fan the flame within us, Lord,

655
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:23,300
 to rise up and be a worker in your field of harvest.

656
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,580
 We proclaim that the workers will no longer be few,

657
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,860
 because we step forward and say,

658
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,660
 "Yes, Lord, here I am.

659
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,660
 "Take me as I am, and use me in your field of harvest."

660
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,520
 Thank you, Lord Jesus.

661
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,860
 We ask this in your name, amen.

662
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,100
 - Amen.

663
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,940
 Thank you.

664
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,980
 And then lastly, the next generation.

665
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,300
 I'm gonna invite my friend to come and just pray over that.

666
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,900
 So if there's anyone who is seated,

667
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,480
 I imagine this is probably gonna be you.

668
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,540
 Join us just to pray for the next generation

669
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,460
 here in the city.

670
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:04,420
 - Heavenly Father, I lift up in prayer

671
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,500
 the young people whose spheres of influences

672
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,840
 are in schools like myself.

673
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,780
 We known as students, we have a lot to learn,

674
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:19,460
 yet we can also be an example for others in speech,

675
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,020
 in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.

676
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,260
 We seek your blessing to be the students

677
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,100
 you call us to be.

678
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,320
 Jesus, our greatest teacher,

679
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,340
 would you teach us how to stand by our friends,

680
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,060
 our classmates, our teachers, our teammates,

681
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,980
 our sports coaches, our teachers,

682
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,180
 and our bus drivers.

683
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,880
 Holy Spirit, our closest helper,

684
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,740
 may you give us boldness in our positions as students.

685
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,540
 When we need to extend ourselves to give,

686
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:09,540
 to care, to forgive, and to teach the people around us,

687
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,580
 grant us peace, in Jesus' name, amen.

688
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,620
 - Father, we thank you for the opportunity that we get

689
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,020
 just to be able to come together as a community,

690
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,180
 to be able to reflect on what it means to love you

691
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,820
 and to find our satisfaction in you,

692
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,180
 but at the same time to know that

693
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,140
 that is not all that you're calling us to do,

694
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,700
 calling us to love the person next to you.

695
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,500
 So that as we stand here today, Lord,

696
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,900
 I just pray that you would just bless and encourage

697
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,600
 each and every one of us in the responses that we take,

698
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,420
 and take the opportunity that we have to live our faith

699
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,220
 externally into society around us.

700
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:52,620
 Lord, we thank you for that in your mighty name, amen.

701
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,200
 (upbeat music)
