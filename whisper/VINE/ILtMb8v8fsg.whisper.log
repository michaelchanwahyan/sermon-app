[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (Applause)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   "Swing Low," written by Wallace Willis in the late 1800s,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   made more popular in the 1900s by a group of African-American singers
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   called the Fisk Jubilee Singers.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   This song has been around for a while in its transcended genre.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   It's been sung by Dolly Parton, it's been sung by Johnny Cash,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   it's been sung by the Beatles,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   it's been sung by Johnny Cash, it's been sung by Alicia Keys.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And the reason people sing this song is because of the themes in the song.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   The song is a bit of a retelling,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   emphasizing on certain parts of the story of Elijah.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Now, Elijah is my personal favorite Bible character.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   I've named my son Elias after him.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   The story of Elijah is of a prophet who is taken from Earth.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And the chariot swings low and carries him to Heaven.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Themes of hope.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   That's why this song was sung.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   But see, the singers of this song, African-American slaves,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   actually sung it for multiple reasons.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   One of the other reasons was that it was a bit of a code,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   it was hidden language.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   See, the idea of "Swinging Low" was a reference to the fact that Harriet Tubman,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   a woman who was known for helping slaves escape the South
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   via the Underground Railroad, would be close.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And so African-American slaves would sing this
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   as a way of communicating to one another
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   without letting their oppressors know
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   that there was a chance that they could escape to rest that very night.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   "Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home."
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   You can see that this song is pretty weighty.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It's pretty powerful lyrics, both to the singer and to those listening.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   A song speaking of hope, of a future peace, of a future rest for people.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   "Coming for to carry me home."
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   In these lyrics, home is not just the place you go to rest, to sleep,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   to lay your head down.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   No, home is a place that is providing you freedom from conflict,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   freedom from oppression, freedom from death and pain.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   It's a place of actual rest.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   See, this is a song that was sung by people done wrong, but unbroken,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   by the land they lived in, weary from the oppression of their circumstances,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   but still pointing their hope towards a future rest from their oppressors,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   towards a future restoration of their dignity.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   This was a song of rest for the restless,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   a song for all of those who were truly weary.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   The second song we look at over this Advent series
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   comes from a guy who sings it, but ironically enough,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   a few seconds before, it had been mute for a long time.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   He's a well-educated man.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   He's grown up knowing the Scriptures extensively.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   An older man who's been serving God his whole life,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   which would mean that he would have witnessed the deterioration of his homeland
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   while waiting for God to fulfill a promise.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   He's a man of God from the tribe of Levi.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   He's a priest wrestling with the tensions of seeing his people suffer for so long.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   He would have known the promises that one day a Messiah would come and rescue them,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   but he hadn't seen it yet.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   This man was Zechariah, the priest.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   See, Zechariah wasn't a marginalized individual.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He wasn't on the outskirts of society.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   He would have been someone that would have been seen as a bit more of a prestigious fellow,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   had a sense of honor,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   but yet he too felt the same oppression that people like Mary
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   that we talked about last week would have been feeling and singing about.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   The first story we get of Zechariah is of him doubting the Word of God,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   which is odd because I guess when I think about it,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Zechariah is a priest.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I was thinking of this yesterday.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I'm like, "Man, if I were a priest and I'd been serving God for a long time,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and it's like, 'Oh, your name gets to be in the Bible,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   and the story's going to be written about you,'
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I would hope it would be about something other than my doubt."
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   But this is Zechariah's case.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   See, Zechariah is in a bit of a predicament.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   He's an older guy, and he and his wife are without child.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   They've been wanting a child for a while.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   But there's been this prayer and these prayers and these prayers,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   and God has done nothing.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   He has failed to act.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It's like God has been silent.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So one day Zechariah goes to fulfill his priestly duties of lighting incense
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   in the holiest place in the temple.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And an angel appears to him and says, "Zechariah, good news.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   You and your wife are going to have a kid.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   God has heard your prayers.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   We should be rejoicing you."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And Zechariah is any critical-thinking, rational individual.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   His first thought is, "I'm a bit old."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You know, like, you know, if you're later down the road,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   that's probably not what you're thinking is about having a kid
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   when you're in your 70s, 80s, or 90s.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   That's the space that Zechariah is in.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And an angel says, "You're going to have a kid."
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   He's first thinking, "Yeah, that's probably not possible, mate."
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It puts him in this position of doubt
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   because he's been praying for so long,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   waiting for God to answer this prayer, and it hasn't happened.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   He's probably reflecting, thinking, "Man, God,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   if you really wanted to step in and do a miracle,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   why didn't you hit me up in my 30s and 40s?"
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   That would have been the perfect time for you to show up and do a miracle.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   So this is a prayer that's been unanswered,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   much like the bigger prayer that him and his people
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   have been praying for salvation
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   while they remain under a deeply oppressive system.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   See, Zechariah's faith was weary. He was tired.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And that happens to us sometimes, too.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   We, too, get tired. We, too, get weary.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Sometimes faith is a thing of endurance,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   and our circumstances can impact our stamina.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   This was the case for Zechariah,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   and neither him nor his father or his father's father's generations before
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   had been waiting for a while for this promise to be fulfilled,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   for God to act on their behalf,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   when nothing had happened yet.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And so in his little altercation with the angel--
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   the angel makes a bit of an example out of him--
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   the angel takes away his ability to speak for the next nine months,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   and Zechariah would sit and would have to think and process for a bit.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And, you know, what the angel says comes true.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   His wife Elizabeth is pregnant, has a child,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   and they're all wondering, "What are you going to name the baby?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   What are you going to name the baby?"
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And Elizabeth is like, "Oh, we'll name him John."
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And they look at Zechariah, thinking, "That surely can't be the name.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Why John?"
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And so they look at Zechariah, and they're like, "What are we going to name him?"
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And he writes it down.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And to their surprise, when he holds up the sheet of paper, it says "John."
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And immediately his voice comes back.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And the first thing he does, a bit different than when he was doubting--
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   the last time he spoke, he was doubting the angel's word.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   This time, as his voice comes back, we look at Luke 1, 67, and he says this.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   and prophesied, 'Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   because he has come to his people and redeemed them.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   He has raised up a horn of salvation in the house of his servant David,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   as he said he would through the prophets of long ago.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all those who hate us,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   the oath he swore to our father Abraham, to rescue us from the hands of our enemies
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   and to enable us to serve him without fear and holiness and righteousness
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   before him all of our days.'"
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   See, this is the first thing that comes out of Zechariah after nine months of stewing.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Within this song, I believe there's some pretty compelling truths
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   that show us a couple of things about rest,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   about how we can be at rest in this current moment,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   regardless of what's going on, and how we can find rest,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   where to look, where to turn our eyes if we are in need of rest.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And I would think this is pretty relevant to a lot of us.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   The past couple of years in Hong Kong hasn't been the most restful.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   When you do your reflection back on the year in a couple of weeks
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   around New Year's Eve and you're celebrating,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   if someone asks you how their year's going,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   your guess is that I doubt you'll say it's just been a real restful year.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And so this passage has something to show each of us about what rest looks like,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   because we long for rest.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   We were made to live within that shalom and that wholeness that God offers us.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And Zechariah, after not speaking for months, still in this system,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   nothing has changed about the big picture.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Let's get that straight.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   It's not like nine months later, all of a sudden, all the oppression is just gone.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   No, nine months later, his baby has come,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   and the Holy Spirit comes upon him, fills him,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   and he sings that God has come.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   He sings that there is rest.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And I think as we look into this, we can find for ourselves what rest looks like
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   and how we can enter into it.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   So Zechariah's song opens with praises.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   He praises God because he has come.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And that's what this whole season's all about, right?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Like God has come to his people.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   That's the whole idea of Advent, the waiting for God to come.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And Zechariah opens his mouth and says, "God has come."
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   It's been just nine months ago.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Zechariah was doubting that God would do the very thing he promised to do,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   and that was a bit of a smaller thing compared to the bigger scale picture.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   He was doubting the words of the angel, but now Zechariah is saying,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   "God has come. God is here. Hallelujah, he's here."
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Like this has been 1,600 years of prophecy unfulfilled,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   of people desperately longing for some type of salvation,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   for God to come and to save them from their oppression,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   and Zechariah is saying, "God is here."
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   We look at the verse again, and he said,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   "Through his prophets, holy prophets of long ago,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those who hate us,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   the oath he swore to our father Abraham."
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   See, this was a bit of an old, old promise, an old covenant made a long time ago.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Many have come, many have passed, and it's not happened yet.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And we've all been in that position as well, where something was promised a while ago,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   and we've been waiting, and we've been waiting, and we find ourselves,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   it's been so long that we doubt that the promise was even made, more or less,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   that it would ever come through.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   This would be the state of the audience that Zechariah would be singing and prophesying to.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   The Jewish people, that's where they would be.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   So, in Zechariah's first line, that God has come,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   he's actually offering them his first way of finding rest.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   And what is that rest, you might ask?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   It's this, we can rest assured that God has remembered his promise.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I mean, we're just saying that, right?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   The promise still stands.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   No mountain, no walls, like, the promise still stands.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Advent is our reminder of a God who has heard his people,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   who has been faithful to his word, who doesn't say one thing and does another.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   But a God who remembers his promise.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   He hadn't forgotten about his people.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And this is funny, this is like the second time this has happened.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   See, if we look back in scripture, we look at the Exodus story,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   these people are under oppression for 400 years underneath a deeply oppressive system,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   similar to the way that they are in the first century.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And they think God hasn't heard them, but he breaks into their silence,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   and he sends them Moses to rescue them.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   But this time it'd be a little different.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   God's not sending Moses.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   He's not sending an Elijah.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   No, God himself is coming into the brokenness, into the systems of oppression,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   into our darkness, to be with us.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   And today we can rest assured because our God keeps his promise.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   His promise still stands.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   His words are still true today.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   We think about how, for a lot of us, a promise can feel conditional.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   When we make a promise to someone or we say we'll do something,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   it's depending on, well, in the next eight years or over this period of time.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   This promise was made 1,600 years previous.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   The state of the people of Israel had changed.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   They had gone from being a nation that was following God, and God kept his promise,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   to being a nation that fell into idolatry, but yet God still keeps his promise.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   A nation that was given God's presence in the Ark of the Covenant
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   and lost it in their unfaithfulness, but God chooses to still keep his promise.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   A nation that had been unfaithful, following after God,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   placing their faith in other things, in themselves, and God chooses to be faithful.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   A nation under foreign occupation and the people are losing hope
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   about whether God hears them, doubting if he's even there,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   just going through the rhythms and the routines without meaning any of it.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And God keeps his promise.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   There's something to hold onto here.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   God will keep his promise.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   He keeps his word, independent of how we failed, doubted, or forgotten him.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   That's just the God we serve.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   He's consistent. He's not going to waver.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   If he says yes, it'll be yes.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And I know, God is looking for us, yes,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   to be people who desire to live a faithful Christian life committed to him.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   But the reality is we will have those moments of doubt.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   We will have those moments where we fall short.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   And how we can be at rest is to know that God isn't changing in that time.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   His promise still stands. He still keeps his promise.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And if God could keep his promise to a broken nation
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   that has strayed so far from where they once were,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   that had lost their knowledge of him, had lost their spark,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   if he could keep his promise and come into that space
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   and be with that people,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   then there's no situation that you're in.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   There's no darkness that you're in.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   There's no shame that you can carry that's too shameful.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   There's no hurt beyond what he can step into.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   If he can enter a nation that would barely recognize him,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   he can step into your space today.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   He's come for the righteous, for the sinners.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   He's come for those who believe.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   He's faithful to those who don't yet believe.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   This is why Zachariah is singing and rejoicing,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   because you can find rest in this.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   You don't have to worry about,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   "Is God going to change his mind on me?
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Is God still going to love me? Is God still God?"
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   He is faithful. He keeps his promise. He keeps his word.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And that is why Zachariah sings,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   because he has come to his people and redeemed them."
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   God has kept his promise.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Zachariah continues after explaining
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   that God is worthy of praise because he keeps his word
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   no matter what happens.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   God keeps his word.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   He continues and lays out a second understanding
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   of what rest could look like.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Rest based off of the understanding
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   that God has this mission that is massive.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   When you understand the mission of God,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   what he's up to in the world,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   it can bring you to rest.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And it reads like this,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   "Salvation from our enemies,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   from the hand of all those who hate us
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   to show mercy to our ancestors,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   to remember his holy covenant,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   the oath he swore to our father Abraham,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   to rescue us, to rescue us
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   from the hands of our enemies."
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   God's agenda is about saving people.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   It's about rescuing a lost people,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   a people in need of hope and in need of rest.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   See, this idea of salvation is a loaded, complex topic.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Pastor Andrew broke into it last week
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   when he looked at Mary's song of salvation.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   But you have to understand, like he said,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   salvation to the Jews isn't,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   their first century Jewish people
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   aren't thinking about the cross and eternity.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   They're actually just thinking about right now.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Like we need salvation from this.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   This moment is hard.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   We need salvation from here.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Salvation from our enemies.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   That was a package deal that came
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   with some sensitive and deep expectations
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   because the people had real enemies.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   They had been taken over by the Babylonians and destroyed,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   taken over by the Persians and exiled,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   now under foreign occupation by the Romans.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   They had needs.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   They needed saving.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   And they'd been crying out for years.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   And so it's because of this reason
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   they would start to see their salvation
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   to mean the removal of the present struggle that I'm in,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   the current issue.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   That's what God's salvation.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   When they would hear this,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   they would think salvation means this.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   But actually the angel would mean something a little different.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   It's critical that we don't miss this.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   God's salvation has a bigger impact
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   on our eternal condition
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   than just the removal of our present trouble.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   I'm going to say that one more time.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   God's salvation has a bigger impact
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   on your eternal condition
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   than just the removal of your current struggle.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   That's the salvation Zachariah is singing about.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Salvation of the spiritual type.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Salvation through the removal of the threat
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   that anything or anyone can ever pose on you
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   and make you prisoner to or subject to.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   That salvation is an eternal rest.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   It's a long-term thing.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   God has kept his promise and he offers us that salvation,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   changing the trajectory of you and my eternity.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Playing a long game,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   putting us in position
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   to choose an eternity of rest with him,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   of shalom,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   which means we're able to navigate
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   through the situations we're in currently.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   See, we can work through just about anything,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   just about anything,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   when we know that we've been saved
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   and that there is an eternal rest for us.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   When we know how the book ends,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   we read it more confidently.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   And the story ends.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   What salvation would mean is that the story ends
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   with God rescuing us forever
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   and us being with him
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   in that type of eternal rest.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   See, God brings about a salvation
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   affecting the condition of the soul,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   shifting humanity's eternal position
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   and restoring us back to him.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   God's salvation isn't temporary,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   but our temporary current struggles are.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And that's something to really think about.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   The salvation he's offering us through this
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   isn't gonna burn out,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   isn't gonna stop working,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   isn't gonna grow old,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   isn't gonna fail and wither.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   But the current tensions that we sit in,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   the current struggles of today
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   may only last today,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   may only last this year.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   See, God's salvation changes our perspective
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   on what's eternal and what's not.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   His salvation makes sure that our eternity
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   can be filled with rest.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   It's an eternity of restoration,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   an eternity of shalom.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   That eternity is promised to us,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   and it's something like this,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   where our tears are wiped away,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   where there's no more shame,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   where no more weeping,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   no more sorrow, no more death,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   where we're no longer striving,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   where we're no longer thwarted by our enemies,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   to where fear and death can no longer alter
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   who we're called and who we're meant to be.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   This is the eternal rest that God's mission,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   God's salvation is speaking to.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   This is what Zachariah is singing about.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   In Advent, this season that we're in,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   is the starting point.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   It's when God steps into the world
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   and begins his plan of salvation.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   It's where the rubber would meet the road.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   And I think it's seeing this and understanding this,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   that Zachariah is possessed with song,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   to where as soon as he gets a chance to,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   he sings praises to God,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   because God has come to rescue us,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   to bring us salvation.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Regardless of our trouble,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   God comes and he offers you and me
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   a salvation that goes beyond just today,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   goes beyond just the temporary obstacles that we can see,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   a salvation that covers all.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   He comes to offer us an eternal rest.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Zachariah wraps up his passage,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   his song, his singing,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   by hitting on a really big topic about rest,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   which kind of is a bit of the big story of scripture.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   From both Genesis all the way to Revelation,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   we see this concept woven in between the stories
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   and the principles and the precepts.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   The very last line of this passage says this,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   "To enable us to serve him without fear,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   "in holiness and righteousness,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   "before him all of our days."
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Without fear.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   It's a beautiful condition
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   and a hard thing for us to step into.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   See, for all of human history,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   from Genesis 3 onward,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   there's been this continual pursuit
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   to regain what was lost,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   and what was lost.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   It was a space where humanity could live without fear,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   could live full and live whole.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   That was the Garden of Eden,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   a state of all perfect harmony.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   It's promised again in Revelation chapter 22.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   We see Eden restored,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   so that all of us, all of creation,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   can enter once again into this rest
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   that comes without fear.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   The people of God would spend the majority of their time
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   chasing after this,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   a rest that looks like a freedom from their enemies,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   a restoration and a peace.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   I think it's because rest looks like the existence,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   our existence without fear,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   it makes it really easy for the people
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   to see what Zachariah is talking about
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   and to see that the only way that's possible
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   is if they were in a specific situation
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   or if things looked a certain way.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   For them, if they were in their land with no oppressors,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   then they had no reason to be afraid.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   So they started seeing rest based off of their land,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   based off of their circumstance.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Their rest had become dependent
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   on things going a certain way,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   on the stability of their land,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   on the way that their country was set up,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   on what they deemed necessary
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   to actually enter into rest.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   All the while, God is promising to send a Messiah
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   who's going to come and set the captives free,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   but in their situation,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   they still have all this oppression,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   so how can they be at rest?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   The people were looking for God
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   to come and shift a geopolitical landscape.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   They were looking for him to come and change the settings
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   and the conditions of their land.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   God was actually coming to change the settings
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   and the conditions of their heart.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   See, they were looking in the wrong place.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   They were missing it.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And I think we too can find ourselves
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   weary and exhausted and restless
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   when we spend our time looking for a good thing,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   looking for the right thing,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   but in the wrong place.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   See, yesterday I went on a walk,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   like pastors do,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   and took my notes with me,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   and I was going to read through my sermon,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   prepare, internalize it.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And in order for that to happen,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   I knew I needed a couple of things.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   The first thing I needed was my fanny pack.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   So I clipped on my Nike fanny pack,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   getting ready to step out the door.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Had my AirPods and my fanny pack
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   so I could listen to some music.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Then I had my camera.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   I actually don't know why I had my camera.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   I just felt like I needed to take it with me.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   So I'm walking out the door.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I get to the lift, press the button, go out, start walking.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   I live in Chukwuno,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   so there's a beautiful little harborfront area.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   I'm walking by the promenade.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   It's great.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And I'm getting ready to get into the zone
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   to read this sermon and really hear from God.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   I'm like, "You know what I need?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   "I need some good preacher music,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   "some good Jesus worship music."
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   So I'm like, "All right, let me get my headphones out."
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   So I open my fanny pack,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   pull out my little white case of my AirPods,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   and it's empty.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   (audience laughs)
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   That's not really how the story was supposed to go.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   So I'm like, "Okay, fine, it must be in my pocket."
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Because I do make that mistake every so often.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I put something where it doesn't belong.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   My wife gets on to me quite a lot about it, and she's right.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And this was a great example of it.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   So I'm like, "You know what?
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   "If it's not in my AirPods, maybe it's in my pocket."
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   So I start searching my pocket, searching my back pocket.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I have a jacket on, so I'm searching that pocket.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   That has another pocket inside.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   I'm searching every possible pocket that's available,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   and there's no AirPods in them.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And I'm starting to get pretty annoyed
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   and pretty frustrated and pretty restless
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   because all I need to really hit that zone
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   of me and God in this sermon is some good music,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   and I'm so close.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   I've got my phone,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   but I can't just play it loud.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   It's not gonna work.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   So it hits me.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   I just don't have my AirPods,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   so I guess I have to go back home.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   So frustrated promise is just walking back,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   moping head down, pretty frustrated,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   uttering all sorts of ridiculousness under his breath.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   And I--like, my ears feel funny.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   So I take my hand, and I do this.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   And guess where my AirPods were.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Silly.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   It's sitting right in my ears.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   I had gone through this whole range of emotion
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   because my AirPods were in my ears.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   But how often is that the case with us,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   where we're looking for something in the wrong place?
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   What does that do to us spiritually
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   when we look for rest in the wrong place?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   That's the very source of our restlessness.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Can I break it down for us?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Rest isn't gonna be found in a nation or in a country
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   or in a virus-free world.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   It's not gonna be found in a better bank account statement.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   It's not gonna be found in--name it.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   That rest isn't situational or circumstantial.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   And when we seek these circumstances,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   maybe a better strategy,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   maybe a better 2022 list of goals,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   then I'll be at rest.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   You won't enter into lasting rest that way.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   It's not how it was designed.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   No, rest couldn't be found in the land for the Jewish people
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   because it was never in the land.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Rest is salvific.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   It's based off of salvation,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   off of something that only God can offer us,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   a restoration of what is broken.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Rest is the releasing of our extraneous efforts
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   to earn God's favor.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   It's God ridding us of having to live in fear of our sin,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   of our enemies, of anything.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Rest is the state where the condition of our world
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   doesn't distort our holiness or righteousness,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   but rather we are free to serve him and to know him.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   This is Zachariah's song.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   This is, like, the pinnacle of what he's saying.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Free from fear, what rest really looks like.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   So we get weary looking for rest in all the wrong places,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   like I was looking for my AirPods in all the wrong places.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   So I guess the logical question is where do you actually look?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Where is the right place?
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Cool, you've listed nine places, promise, where I can't find rest.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Give me one place where I can find it.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Thank you for asking that question.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   I will give you one place.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Rest is only found in what we celebrate in this Advent season.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   That's why this passage is here.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   See, Advent is the anticipation, the longing, the waiting,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   and the receiving of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Born in a manger in a most humble of positions,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   that's actually where we're going to find our rest.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   It's not going to be in the state of things.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   It's going to be in him.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Rest would be a baby born in a manger.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Rest would be Jesus who grew up and would say
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   one of the most beautiful things in scripture.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   He would say this, "Come to me."
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   He's calling, "Come unto me, all of you who are weary,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   "heavy laden, restless," use whatever translation you want.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   "If you've got stuff, come to me, and I will give you rest."
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Not, "I will tell you where to go to get rest."
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   "I won't give you money, that'll give you rest."
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   "I won't give you a more perfect land, and that'll give you rest."
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   No, "I'll give you me."
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   The idea is this, rest can only be found in Jesus.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   That's because rest is not a place, it's a person.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Jesus won't point you somewhere to find your rest.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   No, he'll say, "Come, follow me.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   "If you've got stuff, that's okay.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   "Come to me, all of you who are weary,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   "all of you who are in chains, and I will give you rest."
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Rest without fear, rest that allows you to serve him
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   in holiness and in righteousness, free from fear.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   And wouldn't we love that?
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   That's the reason Zachariah sings.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   That's the reason Jesus comes to earth.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   That's the reason we celebrate Advent.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   We, his people, celebrate the remembering of a God
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   who keeps promises.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   His promise still stands.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   A God whose plan to save us is not just to save us
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   from today and today's troubles,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   but has a longer, bigger picture, bigger than we think.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Man, the worship set was right on, guys.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Well done.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Advent is a season calling us, those of us who are restless,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   those of us who are weary, to come and follow him,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   because that's how we're going to find our rest.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   That's the only way we can live, free from fear,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   free from the bondage that sin and that life can put on us.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   So here's my pitch, here's the thing.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   I know we're tired, I'm tired, it's been a hard year for me too.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   I'm exhausted.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   A lot of us here at the Vine are actually weary,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   we're actually restless.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   We can't make a light of the challenges that the people
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   in Hong Kong have faced in the past two years.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   People around the world are facing with this virus.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   And because of those challenges,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   it might seem like rest is impossible.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   It might seem like if rest exists,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   it might just be right out of my reach.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   And what we so desperately need is a kind of rest
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   that allows us to remember that God keeps his promise,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   a rest that then brings a confidence to us.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   What us weary people need is a rest that shows us the eternal,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   the big picture of what God is doing,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   even when we can't see it,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   even when our situation hasn't changed right before our eyes,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   what he's doing internally and eternally.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   A rest that will combat our fears,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   delivering us from the threat and the hold and the grip
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   that our enemies, that our sin, that our shame,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   that our insecurities have on us,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   and render their impact as ineffective against our soul.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   So maybe you're here today and you fall into that category.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Maybe you would say my life feels like,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   characterized by incessant fear.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Maybe it's fear of the future,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   fear of this next wave of the virus,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   fear of not being fully in control of your life,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   fear of not getting the job that you wanted,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   just name it.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   All of those impact us and take a toll on us,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   but the good news today is that in Jesus,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   we can be free from those fears.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   He can show us how to live without those things
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   distorting our view, without those things oppressing us,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   without those things breaking us down from the inside.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   So if you're tired and you're weary,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   if you're broken, if you're hopeless,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   if you got stuff, that's okay.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   He doesn't say only come to me if you're perfect.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   He says come to me if you're tired.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   If you're weary, great, come to me.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   If you're restless, okay, come to me.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   If you've got a bunch of stuff, come to me.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And in that coming to him, there's this beautiful exchange.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Where God actually swaps some things.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   See, he takes your burden, he takes your shame,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   the things that are holding you,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   that are freezing you from being who you're meant to be,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   the fear that we can live in, he actually takes that.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And in place of that, he gives you something else.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   He gives you his rest, and that rest
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   is what allows us to walk daily with him.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   It shows up in things like courage when we don't have it,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   strength when we feel weak, hope when all seems lost.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   All these fruit of the spirit, self-control and patience
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   and gentleness when things aren't gentle around us.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   That's what entering into his rest can do for us.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   When we exchange what we have for what he is,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   he allows these things to bud in us,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   bringing us into a space where we can be full of rest,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   free from fear, and in wholeness.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   May this Advent season lead us into a place
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   of deeper rest with Christ,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   born unto us so that we will know him
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   and that we will know rest.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Let's stand and we'll pray.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   (pages rustling)
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   God, your words are true.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Your words are good, and your words say
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   that you keep your word, you keep your promise.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   So God, we just come before you today
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   as people with various things on our heart,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   various things that impact who we are.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And we come to a promise keeping God,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   knowing that if you did it then,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   if you kept your word then, you'll keep your word to us.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   God, we thank you for Advent.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   We thank you for Jesus coming and being with us.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   We thank you that your plan for our salvation
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   isn't just for right now.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   God, thank you that you care about tomorrow as well.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Thank you that your plan is well thought of.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   And God, we find ourselves in this space of restlessness
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   when we seek after sometimes good things,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   but in the wrong places.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   God, some of us are tired looking for good things
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   in the wrong places and not finding it.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And I just pray, Lord, that your spirit
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   will come and minister to us,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   will redirect our efforts,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   not to a thing, not to a location,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   not to a setting or a circumstance, Lord,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   but through your spirit, will you turn our eyes,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   shift our perspective,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   and allow us to follow you more closely.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   And God, we ask for your rest.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   We know that you know what it's been like.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   We know because you came and you have felt it all
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   and you've walked in oppression and you've been there.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   And so God, from the sin that entangles us,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   we ask for your rest.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   For the personal deep insecurities that plague us
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   from being who you call us to be,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   we ask for your rest.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   For the brokenness in our homes and in our families,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   relationships where things just aren't as they're meant to be,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   we ask for your spirit and for your rest.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   May your presence come.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   May your spirit work in us, Lord.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   And may you lead us to a place
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   where we can live in that rest that you so freely give.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   [music]
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   [music]
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.580]   (gentle music)
