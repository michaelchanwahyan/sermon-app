[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060]   I want to be just open your hands before the Lord now.
[00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.040]   As we were worshipping,
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.320]   I saw a picture of a massive ball of string.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.520]   And this ball of string was filled with all these knots.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.320]   And there was somebody who was trying desperately
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.960]   to untie all the knots in this massive ball of string.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.320]   And it was super stressful for that person.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.240]   We've just been singing a song about release and freedom.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.000]   Been singing a song about how there's power
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.960]   How that He is our living hope.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.760]   And one of the great strongholds over the city of Hong Kong
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.500]   is the stronghold of anxiety.
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.040]   And I want to just take a moment to speak into anxiety.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040]   And if that is something that is impacting you
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.600]   in this season of your life,
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.400]   we want to just do a little bit of work
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.220]   with the Holy Spirit right now in that place.
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.720]   So whilst every eye is closed,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.360]   I want you just to take a moment.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.760]   And if anxiety is something that's a reality for you,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.440]   whether it's something that you struggled with in the past
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.800]   or something that you're struggling with right now,
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.720]   and if you're online right now, this is for you too,
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.240]   just for you to close your eyes as well in this moment.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.880]   I want to invite anybody here
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.960]   that recognises the stronghold of anxiety.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.440]   When anxiety is at work in us, it's like a darkness.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.720]   There's like this sense of wanting to flee.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.840]   We're uncomfortable, we're overwhelmed.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.000]   If you're experiencing those emotions recently,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.160]   I want you just to open your hands where you are right now.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.120]   By opening your hands, it's just a simple gesture
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.440]   before the Holy Spirit to say, that's somewhat of my life.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.040]   I recognise anxiety is an issue for me in this moment.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.160]   Father, when we think about that ball of string,
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.120]   we can't do anything.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.600]   And that panic rises in us
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.920]   as we try to unravel the ball of string.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.840]   And our anxiety sits in us
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.760]   when we try to sort out our problems
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.720]   and we try to get ourselves on top of everything.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.400]   That just creates more anxiety in us.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.760]   But Lord, we've just sung a song
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.320]   which declares that You are not in the grave.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.960]   We've just sung a song that declares
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.600]   that You were raised again,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.680]   that You come back for Your church,
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.920]   that You fight battles for us, that You're the Lion.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.160]   And so Lord, I want to pray over anybody in this room
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.800]   or online right now whose hands are open.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.440]   Father, I want to pray for a releasing
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.080]   by Your grace and Your mercy
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.960]   of the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.080]   Lord, we take anxiety and the stronghold
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.480]   that the enemy has over anxiety and fear in Hong Kong,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.200]   and we take it captive in the Name of Jesus.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.040]   Not in our strength, not in our power,
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.600]   but in the power that comes from the Name of Jesus.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.360]   Some trust in horses, some trust in chariots,
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.720]   but we will trust in the Name of the Lord.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.880]   And it is Jesus and Jesus alone that can free you.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.440]   So Lord, I pray for every person with their hands open.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.640]   I pray for the releasing of grace and peace
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.360]   and liberty and joy and love.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.760]   I want to pray for the opposite,
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.080]   outworking of anxiety in the Name of Jesus.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.880]   I want to pray, Lord, for faith to rise
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.800]   in the households that are overcome with anxiety.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.680]   I want to pray for workplaces to be released
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.720]   from unnecessary stress in the Name of Jesus.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.920]   I want to pray for the manipulation that takes place
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.440]   through the use of stress in the workplace.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.780]   And Lord, I want to pray for shalom,
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.200]   the true peace that comes in knowing Christ Jesus,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.240]   a peace that comes in knowing the presence of God
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.600]   in the midst of fear, the presence of God
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.080]   in the midst of our battle with anxiety.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.760]   Father, You and You alone can unravel the ball of strength.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.160]   And Father, I thank You for the liberty that is found,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.440]   the freedom that is found in You.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.680]   What a joy it is to gather together online
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.780]   in this room each week.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.540]   May we never take it for granted the power that there is
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.100]   in the community of Christ, singing the praises of Jesus.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.300]   Your Word says that You inhabit the praises.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.820]   So thank You, Lord, for inhabiting every moment right now.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.220]   Thank You that You inhabit and dwell in every life right now.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.540]   And we pray for the testimony of freedom from anxiety
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.820]   in the Vine Church and in our city, in Jesus' Name.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.740]   Everyone says, amen.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.580]   Amen.
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.580]   Let's give the worship team a round of applause.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.100]   I got one thing for you before you sit down.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.060]   One thing, one thing, one thing.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.820]   The person standing next to you right now
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.940]   is a unique, loved, beautiful creation of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.140]   Would you go and turn to them and say hi,
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.980]   and say, wow, you are unique.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.220]   You are amazing.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.180]   I love you.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.220]   You're awesome.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.700]   Never seen you before.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.540]   Wonderful.
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.400]   You can have a seat as well.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.580]   Ah.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.300]   Ah, there's no place I'd rather be
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.380]   than 11 a.m. on a Sunday with my people.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.620]   Is everybody well?
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.460]   - Yes.
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.740]   - So good to see you guys.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.380]   Welcome to everybody online once again.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.060]   It's so great to have you joining us
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.100]   from across Hong Kong and across the world.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.380]   It is such a privilege to gather in this season
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.100]   to worship Jesus together, and welcome to the Vine.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.660]   If this is your first time, we're so glad that you're here.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.740]   My name's Andrew.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.120]   I'm one of the pastors here,
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.580]   and it's just great that we get to gather.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.620]   If you are new, we just want to recognize you.
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.100]   We're not gonna ask you to do anything that's embarrassing.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.940]   We just wanna ask you to put your hand in the air
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.780]   and wave it at me.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.780]   That's just like say, hey, I'm new.
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.140]   This is my first time to the Vine.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.300]   Anyone new here in the lower house, upper house?
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.420]   Give us a wave.
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.780]   Anyone?
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.620]   Yes.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.520]   Yes.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.740]   I didn't see any hands.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.880]   Surely, surely somebody's new.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.940]   Now you're like, you're like,
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.340]   you're like sinking down in your seat.
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.540]   It's like, oh my gosh.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.420]   Well, anyway, welcome if you are new.
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.860]   We're glad you're here.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.620]   We have three services on a Sunday, 9, 15, 11, and 2.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.300]   And the Vine is way more than just 90 minutes on a Sunday.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.140]   As amazing as this is, and I love it,
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.700]   it's not the totality of what church is about.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.260]   Really, what church is about is community.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.140]   And we experience something of that community
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.100]   when we gather like this,
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.940]   but actually community happens much more
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.320]   when you are known and are known by others
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.860]   and when you get to know others.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.960]   And that takes place in a variety of different ways
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.580]   at the Vine, through small group communities
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.540]   and all of those sort of things that we do.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.740]   So if you're new, after the service,
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.480]   we don't have our usual Connect Hub today
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.180]   because today's a special Sunday.
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.860]   And I'll tell you a bit more about that in a moment.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.700]   But you can come and connect
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.320]   with any of our prayer ministers, any of our pastors,
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.380]   or you can come downstairs to the concierge downstairs
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.940]   and say hi to us, get connected.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.580]   We'd love to welcome you to the Vine and walk with you.
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.620]   And we don't want you to be anonymous.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.820]   And if you're online and this is your first time with us,
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.940]   welcome as well.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.940]   We're so glad that you're here.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.660]   We don't want you to be anonymous online.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.300]   And we know that that's a very easy thing to do online.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.180]   So be brave, put in the chat box,
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.900]   hey, I'm new, this is my name,
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.980]   this is where I'm tuning in.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.780]   And our team that are online right now,
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.800]   we have a team of pastors
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.160]   that are specifically online with you.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.180]   We want them to connect with you.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.560]   So just jump on the chat box, say hi to us.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.900]   We'll say hi back.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.260]   We'll connect with you and we'd love to meet you as well.
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.180]   We are on a special Sunday today.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.180]   This is Branches of Hope Sunday.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.580]   We do this once a year.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.860]   It's a chance for you to find out a little bit more
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.260]   about the work that we do
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260]   for the most vulnerable and hurting in our society.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.580]   If you've been coming to the Vine for any period of time,
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.660]   hopefully you'll know that we believe
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.460]   that God's heart for justice
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.060]   sits at the very centre of the gospel,
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.340]   that we're called to walk in justice,
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.920]   God's justice on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.260]   And we do that throughout our ministries.
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.780]   And most importantly,
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.140]   we do that through the work of Branches of Hope.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.420]   If you're new to our church,
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.740]   Branches of Hope is an NGO
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.940]   that was birthed from the Vine Church.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.100]   It sits separately as an NGO,
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.540]   but in relationship with the Vine.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.920]   And it's really the justice expression
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.120]   of who we are as a church.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.780]   And we serve two groups,
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.040]   largely within the work of Branches of Hope,
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.820]   two marginalised groups in Hong Kong.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.120]   That's asylum seekers and refugees,
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.920]   and those that are either victims
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.480]   or survivors of human trafficking.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.160]   And it's our great privilege to serve those two communities.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160]   And we wanna tell you a little bit more about that.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.680]   You're gonna be hearing their voices.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.320]   Now, as well as today,
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.080]   we are also celebrating what we're calling
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.800]   Branches of Hope Awareness Month, or BOHAM for short.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.440]   And BOHAM runs from World Refugee Day,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.240]   which is on the 20th of June,
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.280]   all the way up to World Day Against the Trafficking
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.140]   of People, it's a bit of a mouthful,
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.240]   that is on July 30th.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.880]   And in that time, we celebrate BOHAM.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.680]   And we do that by stuff that we do here in the services,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.020]   but also importantly, stuff we do in the community,
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.020]   in society around Hong Kong.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.080]   Let me tell you about one of those things that's coming up.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.160]   Starting next week on the 9th of July,
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.620]   and running to the 22nd of July,
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.760]   is an exhibition of photographs of the clients
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   that we serve in Branches of Hope.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.720]   It's a incredible exhibition of photographs,
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.820]   and it's gonna be shown at Orca Restaurant.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.580]   Orca Restaurant is on Wyndham Street in Central.
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.820]   It's run by two incredible people
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.580]   that are part of the Vine Church,
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.460]   and they very graciously are willing to host the exhibition.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.580]   So it'll be on their walls during that period.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.620]   I wanna encourage you, go along to the restaurant,
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.160]   have a great lunch or a great dinner,
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.660]   check out the exhibition,
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.300]   and a portion of your food that night
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.260]   will be donated to the work of Branches of Hope.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.400]   So that's a wonderful thing.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.940]   That's happening from the 7th,
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.580]   sorry, from the 9th to the 22nd of July.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.900]   We wanna really encourage you to check that out.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.660]   Also, right after this service,
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.500]   we have a booth just outside here on the second floor.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.420]   If you're in the upper house after the service,
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.660]   come down the stairs and you'll be on the second floor.
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.620]   If you're here in the lower house,
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.740]   just straight out the doors.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.140]   There's a Branches of Hope booth
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.340]   that is going to be out there after the service.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.780]   Branches of Hope team will be there.
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.020]   They'd love to connect with you, get to know you,
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.420]   tell you a little bit more about the work they do.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.080]   And so we wanna encourage you to do that.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.860]   Today is all about you hearing the voices
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.400]   of those that are surviving
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.240]   some of the toughest conditions in Hong Kong.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.600]   And that's one way to know a little bit more
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.000]   about those voices by engaging with our team afterwards.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.340]   Well, every week you guys have been incredibly generous
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.960]   standing with us with your offering and your tithes
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.840]   and the support work that you do.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.280]   And every time that you tithe into the divine church,
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.800]   we then tithe outwardly as well.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.900]   We support organisations like Branches of Hope
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.380]   and many others in our cities and also around the world
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.580]   in the missions effort and justice effort that we do.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.260]   And I am just so grateful for each one of you
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.580]   for the way that you stood with us in such difficult times.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.620]   We're doing digital offering at this time.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.700]   The QR codes are behind me or online in this moment
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.340]   so that you can actually give digitally.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.540]   Or if you're here in the room,
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.600]   also there's an envelope on your chair.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.620]   If you wanna give cash, credit card, check,
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.880]   however you might wanna do that,
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.740]   you can just fill out the envelope
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.340]   and drop that in the bucket on the way out of the service.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.180]   Let me pray for us as we do our time of offering today.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.300]   Lord, we're grateful that we get to stand
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.160]   in this place of doing an offering.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.780]   That Lord, we recognise in doing so,
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.720]   it's a prophetic way for us to say
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.380]   that our material things do not control us.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.340]   They don't define us.
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.240]   We give out of this gratitude that we recognise
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.820]   everything comes from you and we're stewards of it.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.380]   And so we give cheerfully, open-handedly,
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.480]   knowing that you'll continue to provide for us
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.060]   as we continue to provide for others.
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.260]   Lord, we pray that you would take
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.180]   whatever is given to this church
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.580]   and that we would be generous outwardly as well,
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.780]   releasing your funds to those that need it the most.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.580]   And we thank you for this cycle of giving
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.900]   that is seen in the kingdom of God.
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.580]   What a beautiful thing it is.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.560]   We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.900]   Everyone says, amen.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.000]   Well, today what's really important for us
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.060]   is that you hear the stories
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.140]   of some of the people that are struggling
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.060]   and are on the margins of Hong Kong society,
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.100]   but you hear it directly from them.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.140]   You hear their stories.
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.560]   And so there's a number of ways
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.900]   that we're gonna be doing that for you
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.340]   throughout our service today.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.100]   But one of those ways is through film.
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.820]   So I wonder if you just turn your attention
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.980]   to the screens now.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.220]   And I wanna introduce you to two of the clients
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.020]   that we serve in Branches of Hope, Namala and Maggie.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.600]   (gentle music)
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:36.860]   - I had a good job back home.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.900]   I have a hardworking husband and three amazing kids.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.740]   But after an accident that left my husband disabled,
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.100]   I became the sole breadwinner of our family.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.260]   The pressure was on me.
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.820]   I made the hard decision to leave home
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.380]   and I came to Hong Kong to work as a domestic worker
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.860]   in hope for a better future for my family.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.980]   I am a single mother and have a strong passion
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.820]   to care for my children.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.700]   When I was in my home country,
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.900]   I was abused and threatened by my family and close relatives.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.580]   I tried to run away, but they have linkage with the police
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.140]   and would be able to trace me down.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.540]   I was rejected from the community and had no place to stay.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.020]   I decided to come to Hong Kong to find a stable
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.780]   and peaceful life.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.980]   Later, I became pregnant.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.700]   I am not able to return to my home country
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.380]   because if I return, I will face the same abuse
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.780]   from relatives who are still threatening me now.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:40.340]   I arrived in Hong Kong in 2018
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.620]   after securing employment with the local family.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.700]   In my first few days, my employee was friendly and kind.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.500]   Unfortunately, her facade quickly faded
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.300]   and I realized she was abusive
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.300]   and I was being exploited for work.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.340]   After a year and a half, I couldn't take it anymore
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.100]   and finally escaped.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.300]   Being alone in the streets, I was scared.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.780]   I didn't know where I was going to stay,
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.860]   get food or the medical help I needed,
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.260]   let alone find ways to support my family
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.620]   who was depending on me.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.820]   I became a non-refoulement claimant in Hong Kong.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.500]   When I became pregnant, I faced rejection.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.820]   My relatives in my home country found out
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.380]   and sent threatening messages to me.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.860]   My friends abandoned and insulted me.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.060]   I want to fight for my daughter's status,
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.940]   but since I am unable to work, I felt helpless
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.140]   and I did not know if anybody would help me and my baby.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:44.740]   - Those are not easy stories to listen to, are they?
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.260]   And I'd like to tell you that those two stories
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.900]   are unique to those two individuals,
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.940]   but that wouldn't be the case.
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.740]   There are many in our city that have similar stories
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.900]   of abuse, abandonment, rejection,
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.620]   and difficulty in Hong Kong society.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.740]   You know, it's important for us to make space in our lives
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.540]   to listen to the voices of those who are on the margins.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.740]   It's all too easy for us to insulate
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.620]   and isolate ourselves from those voices.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.860]   But when we do hear those voices,
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.220]   yes, it's hard to hear the stories.
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.740]   Yes, it might stir emotions in us,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.820]   but ultimately it is a way of honouring them
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.780]   as people who are made in the image of God.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.020]   And what we want to do today
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.900]   is we want to create space for you
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.660]   to be able to hear the stories
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.780]   of those who are vulnerable in Hong Kong.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.500]   That's why the theme that we have
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.180]   for Branches of Hope Sunday this year
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.260]   is our voices, our stories.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.980]   And while you're going to hear a little bit from me now,
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.020]   and then you're going to hear a little bit
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.460]   from some of the staff at Branches of Hope,
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.060]   ultimately what we hope and pray you'll hear today
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.940]   is the voices of people like Namala and Maggie
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.220]   sharing their story so that you might be changed.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.780]   And what we pray you hear when you listen to their stories
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.460]   is yes, we hear their challenges, hear their suffering,
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.380]   hear what it is that they're going through,
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.100]   but ultimately you would hear something else,
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.260]   that you would actually hear their unwavering hope
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.060]   that they have in Jesus Christ.
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.780]   This idea of listening to the stories of the vulnerable
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.180]   and the broken amongst us is important
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.300]   to the work of Branches of Hope and of the Vine
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.980]   because it is essentially first and foremost,
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.780]   the work of God.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.420]   God listens to those who are broken and on the margins.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.580]   And there are many examples in scripture
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.540]   of God reaching out and listening to the voices
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.580]   of those who are desperate.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.900]   But today I wanted to take us
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.980]   to one particular passage in scripture
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.860]   to help frame everything that we wanna talk about today.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.900]   It's the passage found in Genesis 19 to 21,
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.940]   and it's the story of two individuals, Ishmael and Hagar.
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.580]   And let me give you just a little bit of context
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.340]   before I open the passage.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.060]   Hagar is an Egyptian slave
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.660]   who is working in the home of Abraham and Sarah.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.500]   Now, Sarah, at this point in the story
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.380]   is incredibly frustrated and bitter at God.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.660]   And she's frustrated at God
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.180]   because she believes that God is to blame
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.140]   for the fact that her and Abraham are barren.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.460]   Some years before, God had come to Abraham
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.300]   and said to Abraham,
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.540]   "You're gonna be a father of many nations."
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.500]   But many years later, Abraham and Sarah
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.980]   are still not able to have their own children.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.500]   And Sarah blames God for this reality.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.700]   She knows that God has given a promise,
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.540]   but she hasn't seen God come through on that promise.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.140]   So Sarah does what perhaps many of us might do
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.220]   in that circumstance, believe the promise,
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.100]   but then bring it and put it into our own hands.
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.100]   She decides her own human effort
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.980]   can bring about the promises of God.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.260]   And trust me, that's always a dangerous thing to think.
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.580]   But what Sarah does is she comes up with a plan.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.420]   She says to Abraham,
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.380]   "Hey, Abraham, why don't you take Hagar to be your wife?"
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.740]   In those days, it was legal to marry more than one woman.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.900]   She says, "Take Hagar to be your wife.
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.660]   You can then sleep together, produce a child,
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.300]   and then that child will be our heir and the promise of God."
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.980]   Well, the story tells us that that's what happened.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.220]   And Hagar had no choice in this matter.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.140]   Not only is she a slave being forced to work in their home,
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.060]   she's now forced into the slavery of marriage
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.180]   with someone she doesn't love.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.500]   Abraham and Hagar sleep together and produce a child.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.540]   And when that child comes forth into the world,
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.540]   God speaks to Hagar over her son.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.480]   And he says to Hagar,
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.580]   "I want you to name your son a specific name.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.300]   You are to give him the name Ishmael."
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.740]   Ishmael in Hebrew means God hears.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.380]   I want you just to stop with that for a second
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.340]   and remember that.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.900]   Ishmael means God hears.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.140]   And that will become the main story
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.660]   of the whole of Ishmael's life.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.220]   Well, not surprisingly,
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:56.140]   Sarah finds herself jealous and bitter at Hagar and Abraham
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.620]   for the fact that they have this child
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.260]   in their life called Ishmael.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.380]   And her plan that she thought was a good one
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.980]   turned out to be incredibly painful and bitter for her.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.100]   So she comes with a new plan to Abraham.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:06.940]   And she says to Abraham,
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.460]   "I want you to get rid of Hagar and Ishmael.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.860]   I want you to send them out,
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.860]   banish them from the Israel nation,
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.020]   send them out into the deserts of Beersheba."
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.820]   Well, this greatly distressed Abraham
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.820]   because the scriptures tell us
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.500]   that Abraham loved his son, Ishmael, genuinely loved him.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:27.260]   And it tore him apart that he would have to send Ishmael away.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.300]   But God shows up to Abraham and says,
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.620]   "Hey, Abraham, just relax
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.020]   'cause my hand is upon Ishmael's life
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.140]   and I will protect him.
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.460]   I will look after him.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.220]   And he will actually become the father of many nations.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.700]   A great nation will come from him."
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.020]   So Abraham, off the back of his obedience to God,
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.940]   even though he didn't wanna do it,
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.580]   puts supplies together
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.220]   and begins to send Hagar and Ishmael on their way.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.420]   Let's pick up the story from that very point.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.380]   This is Genesis 21, starting in verse 14.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.580]   "Early the next morning, Abraham took some food
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.620]   and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar.
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.980]   He set them on her shoulders
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.060]   and then sent her off with the boy.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.420]   She went on her way and wandered in the desert of Beersheba.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.140]   When the water in the skin was gone,
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.660]   she put the boy under one of the bushes.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.940]   Then she went off and sat down nearby,
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.700]   about a bow shot away, for she thought to herself,
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.540]   'I cannot watch the boy die.'
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.300]   And as she sat there nearby, she began to sob."
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.660]   What an incredibly disastrous situation this is for Hagar.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.780]   I mean, that's putting it mildly.
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.460]   Not only has she been enslaved,
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.420]   not only has she been forced into marriage,
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.680]   but now she's been sent out and banished from a community.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.220]   She's sent out with minimal supplies
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.820]   and not surprisingly, those supplies ran out.
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.720]   And she realizes that she cannot,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.580]   because she loves her child so much,
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.060]   she cannot bear the suffering of watching him die,
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.300]   of hearing him cry out.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.740]   And so she places her son under a bush
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.300]   and she goes about, the scriptures say, a bow shot away.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.860]   A bow shot away is about 100 to 150 yards away.
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.500]   She's not so far away
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.880]   that she feels like she's abandoned her son,
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.620]   but she's far enough away that she cannot hear his cries.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.240]   That's really important.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.540]   She's far enough away
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.140]   so that she can't hear the sobbing of her child,
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.580]   so that doesn't bring distress upon her.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.060]   And then as she's sitting this bow shot away,
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.020]   the scriptures say she does something.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.220]   In the English translation,
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.580]   the English translation is not very good.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.260]   The English translation says she sobbed.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.880]   Sobbing for us sounds like.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:37.200]   In the Hebrew, the word means to wail.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.180]   It means to cry out.
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.980]   It means to scream.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.900]   It's the same word that's translated gnashing of teeth
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.460]   in other parts of scripture.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.020]   It's the word that's used to describe old Israelites
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.180]   as they mourned in the Old Testament,
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.380]   as they screamed and made noises before the Lord.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.820]   The idea of this Hebrew word
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.300]   was actually to scream out against injustice.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.300]   So the picture here is of Hagar,
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.180]   a bow shot away from the cries of her son,
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.940]   so she can't hear those cries,
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.300]   and she's making an awful noise before the Lord.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.660]   She's screaming out.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.820]   She's probably saying stuff like,
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.340]   "Why is this happening to me?
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.620]   Why has my whole life been like this?
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.900]   Why have you taken my only son from me?
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.620]   Why are we gonna die in this desert?"
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.060]   And she's screaming and wailing and crying
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.900]   and making the loudest noise she could ever make.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.340]   And the question is, does God hear and respond?
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.340]   Have a look at verse 17.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.060]   "God heard the boy crying,
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.220]   and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.700]   and said to her, 'What is the matter, Hagar?
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.460]   Do not be afraid.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.780]   Don't be anxious.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.340]   Let's unravel the ball of string.'
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.900]   For God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.740]   Lift the boy up and take him by the hand,
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.700]   for I will now make him into a great nation."
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.020]   I love what it says here.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:22:59.980]   Notice what it says here.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.740]   It says, "God heard the boy crying."
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.220]   Do you catch it?
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.700]   Hagar is making an awful noise before the Lord.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.380]   She's screaming and shouting and billowing
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.540]   in the middle of the desert.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.900]   She's drowning out the cries of her son
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.620]   with the loudest cries she could ever have before God.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.020]   And God shows up and he goes, "I've heard the boy crying."
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.980]   In other words, I hear the voice
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.500]   of the one who cannot fight for himself.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.660]   The voice of the one who's in the bushes.
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.860]   The voice who has no ability to fight for himself.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.460]   And it's not that God didn't hear Hagar's cries
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.220]   'cause he responds to Hagar.
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.940]   It's not that he didn't care for her.
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.500]   He's not ignoring her,
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.260]   but he's trying to teach Hagar something.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.500]   And I think the global church, something for all of history
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.020]   that God hears and responds to the voices
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.940]   that so often everybody else ignores.
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.760]   That's the God that we have.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.300]   That's the God that we serve.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.140]   In the amount of noise that Hagar was making,
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.540]   God shows up and goes, "I haven't forgotten your son, Ishmael."
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:10.340]   In other words, God proves Ishmael's name.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.180]   I hear him.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.540]   I hear him.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.860]   Even amongst all the other noise that is happening,
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.740]   I hear him.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.900]   You need to know here in Hong Kong,
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.620]   there's a lot of noise happening all the time.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.400]   There's a lot of sound that reverberates around our city.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.500]   But the reason why we do the work that we do
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:34.180]   at Branches of Hope is because God hears.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:39.100]   He hears the soft, subtle cry of the marginalized,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.060]   the oppressed, the hurting, and the vulnerable.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.380]   And when we and our ears are so blocked
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.020]   by the noise of materialism, the noise of politics,
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.620]   the noise of making money, the noise of career,
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.180]   the noise of really good things
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.540]   that can happen in our lives,
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.780]   God doesn't stop hearing the poor.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.220]   He doesn't stop hearing it.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.300]   And the reality is that I think each one of us,
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.940]   myself included, can always end up living a bow shot away
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.180]   from the cries of the Ishmaels of our city.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.660]   And I think we do this because it's not comfortable
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.100]   to hear those cries.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.440]   It wasn't comfortable for us to watch that video.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.140]   It's not always comfortable for us to sit
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.660]   in the reality of the pain and the brokenness of others.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.820]   Perhaps we stay a bow shot away in Hong Kong
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.260]   because we don't know how to respond.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.580]   We don't know what it is that we can do to help.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.580]   We think perhaps we're gonna make more trouble
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.060]   than actually help.
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.780]   Or maybe we stay a bow shot away because let's face it,
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.900]   the world is a pretty tough place right now.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.300]   There's a lot of darkness in the world.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.580]   There's a lot of bad news, Andrew.
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.540]   I don't wanna come to church
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.300]   and hear any more bad news, Andrew.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.060]   There's a lot of reasons I think why we isolate ourselves
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.380]   and insulate ourselves, why we like Hagar stay a bow shot
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.220]   away from the cries of the vulnerable and hurting.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.380]   And that's why today we wanna close that distance
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.740]   a little bit for you.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.700]   That's why today we wanna make sure you hear some
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.180]   of the cries and the voices of those that we serve
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.500]   at Branches of Hope.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.580]   And that's why we do what we do.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.900]   'Cause we believe that there are many Ishmaels
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.200]   still in this city.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.880]   That because God hears, we should also hear.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.980]   And to help you close that distance a little bit
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.780]   and to help you understand a bit more about the stories
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.980]   of those that we serve through Branches of Hope.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.980]   It's my great privilege today to introduce to you
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.620]   Alex Forte, who is the Executive Director
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:32.460]   of Branches of Hope.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.660]   Can we give Alex a round of applause?
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.820]   (audience applauding)
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.220]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.500]   Good morning.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.060]   Hello, everybody.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.820]   It's a privilege to stand out here in front of you all.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.460]   You'll notice that I come with my little tablet
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.100]   because I'm not as gifted as Andrew.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.260]   So I've got, I have something to hold on to
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.660]   and remind me what I actually wanna tell you all.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.500]   So yeah, it's a huge blessing and privilege
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.740]   to be standing here in front of you all.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.900]   My wife and I, we've been coming to the Divine Church
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.240]   for a number of years now.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.200]   And I would never have foreseen a set of circumstances
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.860]   where I would get to stand in this very holy place
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.220]   in front of all of you and speak to you on a Sunday.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.320]   But the Lord works in mysterious ways, so here I am.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.220]   I joined Branches of Hope, as Andrew mentioned,
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.060]   as Executive Director not so long ago,
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.720]   just back in April.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.740]   But I've known Branches of Hope for a couple of years now.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.420]   In fact, I was aware of Branches of Hope
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.740]   even before it became Branches of Hope
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.740]   when it was still Vine Community Services.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.220]   And so I was aware of that rebranding process
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.660]   and I've watched that organization grow
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.580]   from strength to strength over the years.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.580]   So I'm incredibly honored and humbled
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.100]   to be trusted with the stewardship
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.140]   of this amazing organization.
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.900]   And I feel no pressure at all.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.740]   In fact, this is actually a bit of a perfect moment,
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.760]   I think, in God's perfect timing
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.580]   that I get to step into this role.
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.920]   I feel that from a sort of professional,
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.580]   from a professional view, from a personal view,
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.420]   from a spiritual view, all things have aligned
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.740]   to allow me to really step into this
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.900]   and do this work with full confidence.
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.520]   Professionally, I come after having spent
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.820]   the better part of the last decade
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.380]   working in humanitarian aid in countries
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.980]   like Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan.
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.440]   So I feel I have a bit of experience
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.420]   that I hope I can apply to Branches of Hope
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.820]   and continue this growth of the organization.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.980]   On a spiritual level, I've been blessed
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.900]   to grow in faith, so I feel I'm equipped
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.340]   to maintain that special spiritual bond
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.540]   that connects the vine and Branches of Hope.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.140]   And on a personal note, I recently became dad
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.660]   to the most adorable four-month-old,
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:58.100]   so I have no rush to be in any war zones anytime soon.
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.220]   So now you know a little bit more about me
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.020]   and why I'm representing Branches of Hope today,
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.460]   so we can turn our attention a little bit
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.700]   to why we're even talking about Branches of Hope today.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.220]   Andrew already alluded to it a little bit.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.380]   We are celebrating Branches of Hope Sunday today,
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.300]   which is part of our larger effort this month
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.180]   of Branches of Hope Awareness Month, BOHAM.
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.480]   We're very, very excited.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.420]   There's a bunch of activities going on,
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.300]   and I encourage you to come talk
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.580]   to our colleagues outside at the booth
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.100]   to get the details on those.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.700]   Fundamentally, though, apart from raising awareness
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.660]   for our organization and the work that we do,
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.940]   what we are trying to do this month
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.860]   is to really focus on the stories of our clients,
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.180]   and that's why the motto of BOHAM
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.020]   is Our Voices, Our Stories.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:55.760]   Andrew introduced the story of Hagar and Ishmael
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.420]   from chapter 21 of Genesis,
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.280]   and demonstrated how God hears all,
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.580]   even the smallest muted voices in our society,
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.420]   and how that is a challenge to us
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.460]   to really come and become active,
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.380]   to do God's work, to do good.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.580]   On reflecting on the passage,
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.240]   I was also reminded a little bit
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.740]   of how Hagar, in many ways, personifies the injustices
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.900]   faced by the clients that are served
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.420]   through branches of FOBE
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.700]   by both our STOP and ROAD programs.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.740]   Like the clients who are served by STOP,
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.960]   Hagar is a slave,
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.860]   the most vile form of labor exploitation imaginable.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.120]   And like the clients that are served by ROAD,
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.860]   she has been made a refugee.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.880]   She's been kicked out of her community.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.100]   She's been made to fled,
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.680]   not by her own choice, but by circumstance.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:56.380]   I think the significance of what that means
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.260]   of the suffering that that entails,
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.660]   the challenges that comes with that
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.160]   was also demonstrated in the video that we saw earlier.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.060]   And so, at Branches of Hope,
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.500]   when we see people like this on a daily basis,
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.240]   what we want to achieve for them,
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.900]   and it's captured in the slogan of our organization,
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.400]   is dignity, justice, and hope.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.940]   We try to achieve this for our clients
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.700]   through three distinct service pillars,
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.900]   caring for them, empowering them,
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.820]   and driving social change
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.960]   for the better of not just the marginalized,
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.500]   but for society as a whole.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.760]   And so we do our best every day.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.380]   We do what we can to hear those voices
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.480]   and to empower them to tell their stories.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.980]   Now, to help me tell the stories of Maggie Namala,
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.380]   who we briefly saw already at the beginning of,
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.420]   in the video, I'd like to welcome Michelle Wong,
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.260]   our program manager from STOP,
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.020]   and Roy Njoaba, the head of the ROAD program.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.340]   Please give them a round of applause.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.500]   (audience applauding)
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:07.260]   Welcome, Michelle, and welcome, Roy.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.460]   - Thank you, Alex.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.020]   Hello, nice to be here.
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:11.860]   Hello, everyone.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.020]   You guys doing good today?
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.060]   - Yeah.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:14.900]   - I didn't hear that.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.720]   You guys doing good?
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.560]   - Yeah.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.220]   - All right, I love that.
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.660]   - Yeah, it's always a pleasure to be here.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.660]   Hi, everyone.
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.700]   So Michelle and Roy obviously have been working with ROAD
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:31.460]   and STOP for much, much longer than I've come on board.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.220]   In fact, Roy is the longest serving staff member
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.220]   at Branches of Hope.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.060]   Isn't that right, Roy?
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:37.880]   - Yes, you're right.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.140]   I've been in Branch of Hope for seven and a half years.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.540]   Actually, tomorrow may be exactly seven and a half years.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.100]   - Wow, that's amazing.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.540]   Let's give him a round of applause.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.700]   (audience applauding)
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.340]   So as we just said,
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.340]   we're kicking off this really exciting month,
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.980]   Bohem, Branches of Hope Awareness Month.
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:03.980]   And the motto of this whole month is our voices, our stories.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.900]   We already saw a little bit about the kind of clients
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.620]   that we serve through STOP and through ROAD.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:13.780]   But before we return to the stories of Maggie and Amala,
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.260]   maybe just for everybody's benefit,
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.260]   we could cover what exactly STOP and ROAD do.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.620]   So Michelle, why don't you start with STOP?
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.020]   - Sure, so STOP means Stop Trafficking of People.
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.420]   So we launched a Branch of Support Program in 2014.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.060]   Our mission is to end human trafficking
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.060]   in and through Hong Kong.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.500]   So in order to do so,
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.540]   we provide protection for the survivors
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.940]   of human trafficking.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.620]   We educate a vulnerable community
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.300]   to prevent human trafficking from happening.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.680]   And we conduct research, collect evidence
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:54.180]   to build capacity for the society to respond to the issue.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:58.380]   So you may wonder, what is human trafficking?
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.100]   Is that still happening in Hong Kong?
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.060]   Well, human trafficking is extreme form
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:08.260]   of human rights violation for the purpose of exploitation.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.540]   So obviously, if someone is forced to work
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:17.100]   under violent circumstances, it is human trafficking.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.480]   But human trafficking also involve different means
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.320]   in order to do so.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.280]   For example, deception and coercion.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.900]   For example, using that to coerce someone to work,
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.680]   that bondage is a form of human trafficking.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:38.760]   Deceiving the condition of work is also a common tactics.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.400]   So yes, human trafficking does still exist in Hong Kong,
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.000]   and our team is fighting for that every day.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.660]   - Thank you for that, Michelle.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.400]   I'm pretty sure that there might be a number of you
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.900]   who are actually quite shocked to hear
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.120]   that this form of labor exploitation
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.860]   and the various degrees actually happens every day
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.940]   right under our noses in our own society.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:02.900]   But that is unfortunately the reality of the situation.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.140]   Roy, let's jump over to ROAD.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.500]   What is it that ROAD does exactly?
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.980]   - ROAD actually stands for
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.100]   Refugee Opportunity and Development.
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.620]   So if you hear the definition of ROAD,
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.380]   you know exactly what we are doing.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.840]   To give opportunity and to develop refugees.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.140]   And by doing that, we equip them with knowledge,
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.180]   we educate them, and we empower them for their future
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:29.700]   so that they can become contributors to our society.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.940]   We serve refugees from all over the world,
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.660]   from Africa, Middle East, South Asia,
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.660]   some from Europe, and also from South America.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.020]   And also, the ROAD program actually
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.140]   born out of the VINESH ministry.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.020]   We call it the Refugee Ministry back in 2000,
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.020]   and I don't forget when, but many years ago.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.100]   And so, really, from ROAD, from this Refugee Ministry,
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.020]   it grew up to be a branch of hope that we have today.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.620]   - Okay, and so when we're talking about refugees,
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.140]   who exactly is a refugee?
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.420]   What would be the definition there?
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.580]   - Great, refugees and asylum seekers,
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.740]   it's a common word that we use.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.900]   But in Hong Kong, you hear a word like non-reformer claimant.
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.860]   And so I will break down these three definitions
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.020]   for you to understand these different categories
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.220]   of people who are seeking protection in Hong Kong.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:28.220]   Refugees and asylum seekers are under the mandate of UNHCR
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.440]   because this falls under the 1951 Geneva Convention.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.600]   Non-reformer claimants are under the CAT Convention,
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.380]   which is the 1984 Geneva Convention that protects people
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.580]   not to be returned to their home country.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.860]   So reformer means return to their home country.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.380]   Now, Hong Kong government is a signatory
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.180]   of the CAT Convention and not a signatory
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.980]   of the Geneva 1951 Convention.
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.700]   So in Hong Kong, we basically have non-reformer claimants
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.420]   and not asylum seekers and refugees.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:04.260]   So actually in Hong Kong, we have about 250 refugees
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.400]   under the UNHCR Convention,
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:11.060]   and we have over 13,000 non-reformer claimants
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.300]   under the government of Hong Kong.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.860]   So we noticed that many people often say
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.700]   refugee and asylum seekers by mixing them up
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.540]   with non-reformer claimant,
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.060]   but actually we mostly have non-reformer claimant
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.060]   in Hong Kong.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.340]   Now, for non-reformer claimant,
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.780]   it doesn't matter how you come to Hong Kong.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.140]   Anyone can be a non-reformer claimant
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.380]   if you cannot go back to your country.
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.620]   So non-reformer claimant stop the government
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.420]   not to send you back to a place
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.680]   that you will be in danger.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.820]   But for refugee, it's defined that it's somebody
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.060]   who left his home country because of persecution.
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.340]   So the power is on the people to prove themselves
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.700]   that, look, I left my country because of war and violence.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.940]   But for non-reformer claimant,
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.580]   it gives the government the power
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:57.340]   not to send anybody back to where they will face persecution.
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.980]   So that's how non-reformer claimant is.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.020]   So you hear me use the word non-reformer claimant
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:01.860]   for the discussion,
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.340]   but know that I refer to refugees
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.100]   and asylum seekers as well.
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.180]   - I think that's a very important distinction to make.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.580]   Ultimately, there's various levels of protection
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.780]   that a country can give to people
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:14.020]   fleeing any number of circumstances.
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.060]   And Hong Kong is the most basic one.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.260]   Hong Kong basically says,
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.260]   we're not gonna send you back into danger,
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.020]   but you can't stay here either.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.660]   So ultimately, that's where that distinction comes from.
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.180]   I think it's clear from what Michelle and Roy
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.780]   have just shared that both Stop and Road
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.300]   work with some of the most marginalized individuals
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.620]   in our community.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.980]   In a sense, we work with many of the Ishmaels
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.380]   of our society.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.300]   Now, before we come back to Maggie Nirmala,
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.980]   can you maybe please just explain
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:50.980]   how exactly do Road and Stop give a voice to our clients?
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:55.380]   Is there a unified philosophy between the two programs,
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.940]   a unified approach,
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.700]   or do you both do very different things?
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.700]   Roy?
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.380]   - Yes, as you noticed,
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.740]   Stop served victim of human trafficking
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:08.180]   and Road, we serve refugee and asylum seekers.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.260]   These are two distinct group of people.
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.740]   But however, our approach,
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.260]   we have a unified approach
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.180]   in serving this marginalized group of people.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.060]   And we place approach on the three pillars,
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:23.180]   which is care, empowerment, and social reform.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.420]   You will hear in our discussion
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.820]   about these three pillars in a moment.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.780]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.260]   I mean, this unified approach
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:36.260]   is also reflected in our organizational slogan,
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:39.060]   dignity, justice, and hope.
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.340]   And these are the crucial elements
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.300]   for us to restore our clients' voices.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.140]   - Right.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.780]   And I mentioned this before earlier, right?
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.140]   The slogan that we have at Branches of Hope
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.740]   is ultimately a reflection of the outcome
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.780]   that we hope to achieve
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:56.220]   through these three pillars of service.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.140]   So maybe, Roy, can you explain how that slogan
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.220]   and those three pillars of service,
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.740]   how are they related?
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:02.580]   - Yes, correct.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:07.860]   When you care for somebody, you restore hope.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.580]   So care, restore hope.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.980]   Now you put somebody in a community
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.740]   where they can have people around them to care for them,
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.460]   and that's how their hope is being restored.
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:21.460]   Secondly, empowerment, restore dignity.
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.580]   When you empower somebody, they become self-sufficient.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.540]   They don't have to depend on handouts
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.460]   and charity donation.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.820]   They can care for themselves.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.380]   That is how dignity comes about.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:36.380]   And thirdly, when you, social reform restored justice.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.060]   The more you reform the society,
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.980]   reform people's mindset about what is happening in society,
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.100]   that is how they start to fight for justice,
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.100]   and that's how justice is being restored
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.380]   for the marginalized.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.220]   - Thank you for that.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.620]   I think that's a very powerful truth
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:52.220]   to kind of reflect on and soak in.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.540]   Care restores hope.
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.500]   Empowerment restores dignity.
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.180]   And social reform restores justice.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.940]   And that's not just for the clients that we serve,
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.020]   whether it's refugees or victims of trafficking.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.540]   That applies to any number of marginalized
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.620]   and disenfranchised people in our society
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.540]   and societies around the world.
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.580]   Ultimately, it's that empowerment, that social reform,
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.900]   that care that creates, again, dignity, justice, and hope.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.060]   And dignity, justice, and hope are what, in turn,
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.300]   give people a voice to speak up
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.940]   and be able to tell their stories.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.140]   I think it's also worth reflecting for a moment
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.660]   that it really is a reflection also of our Christian duties
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:36.500]   to care for others, to empower others,
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.140]   and ultimately also to work together to reduce,
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:44.620]   if not eliminate even, all forms of marginalization
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.780]   in our societies.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.700]   I think the work that we do at Branches of Hope
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:53.700]   is also a reflection of our roots within the vine
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.660]   that we are trying very much to do those things,
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:00.340]   albeit focused on refugees and victims of trafficking.
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:05.420]   So let's return now to the stories of Nimala and Maggie
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.220]   and see how those three pillars of service
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.980]   apply to their specific cases.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.740]   Michelle, let's start with Nimala.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.580]   - Sure.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.700]   Our team is so proud of Nimala.
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:20.940]   I mean, it's so incredible to witness her transformation.
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.540]   One year ago, when we first met Nimala,
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.060]   she was anxious and scared.
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:31.180]   Usually people who experience trauma incidents,
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:36.180]   these are very common response to the situations.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:40.580]   So all they want, all they need at that moment
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:44.260]   is to feel safe again without any doubts from others.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:49.260]   So our team immediately admit Nimala to our care program.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.100]   We are able to provide her with basic survival needs,
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:57.340]   such as food, medical support, and shelter.
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.780]   So these are not just tangible support,
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:05.780]   but as Nimala would said, our assistance and our presence
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:09.620]   help her to feel mentally calm again.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.500]   I remember a few months ago
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:15.620]   when she tested COVID positive, like a lot of us did,
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.620]   the first one she called was not her husband,
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.780]   not her children, but our caseworker.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:30.140]   So I can deeply feel that we have such a deep bond
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.180]   with our clients that we are actually
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:37.180]   the only support system in Hong Kong for our clients.
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:41.540]   And we walk through a lot of difficulties together.
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.580]   That's why we bond as a community.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.260]   Like other of our clients,
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:51.500]   Nimala also seek remedy through legal system.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.740]   Through our empowerment program,
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:58.500]   we make sure that our clients knows about their rights
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.700]   and make informed decision
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.620]   in the process of accessing justice.
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.940]   So in the process, Nimala comes to realize
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:11.940]   that her legal action is not just to fight for herself,
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.260]   but it's for the sake of the community.
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:18.380]   And most important is for the sake of justice.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:23.380]   And she start to become, want to become an agent of change.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:26.580]   She wants to become a helping hands for others
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:30.860]   and she go outside and equip others with knowledge
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.380]   of what to do and who to contact when abuse happens.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.900]   So right now on Sundays,
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:42.780]   we have our team going out on the street,
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.820]   talking to migrant workers,
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.340]   equip them their knowledge of building friendship
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.180]   in order to prevent human trafficking from happening.
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:56.100]   Through her story of recovery, I see hope.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.260]   And I see that social change is possible.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:04.060]   These stories of our clients ultimately
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:09.060]   also inform our evidence-based advocacy.
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.180]   So their story enable us to talk
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.860]   to different stakeholders about the issue.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.860]   In fact, it's her bravery of sharing the story with us today
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.540]   enable us to sit here together
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:29.540]   and then share the cause here with you and you here.
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:34.660]   And their story also help us to provide recommendation
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.700]   for the government and achieve social change.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.380]   - Okay, thank you very much for that.
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.220]   So it really, it's a longer process, right?
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.380]   Like the care that's provided
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.300]   leads ultimately to the empowerment
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:51.220]   and the empowerment also altogether enforces
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.460]   the good work that we do on a policy level as well.
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:55.300]   Thank you for sharing that.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.060]   I think also our appreciation, of course, to Nimala
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.700]   for her courage in sharing that story.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.660]   Roy, turning now to Maggie,
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:06.340]   how exactly then did the three pillars of service
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.140]   that we employ at Branches of Hope,
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.460]   how did that help in her case?
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.460]   - Right, when Maggie came to us,
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.620]   Maggie was vulnerable with her daughter
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.140]   and she was really confused and feel rejected
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:21.780]   by the community that she was once into.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:22.740]   So when she came to us,
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.380]   the first thing we did was to listen to her story,
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.540]   listen to her carefully.
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:27.620]   You know, at the road team,
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.460]   they are very specialized in listening.
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.020]   Those guys, they know how to listen very carefully.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.260]   You know, I got Cherry, Chris, you know, Green and Sherry.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.100]   They are experts in listening to the refugee story.
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.460]   They spend hours and time just listening
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.220]   because that is very important to listen to
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.780]   when you want to care for somebody.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.220]   The second thing is to provide basic assistance
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.540]   because once you listen carefully,
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:49.540]   you know exactly what they're looking for.
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:52.020]   Like for example, in the story of Hagar and the son today,
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:56.540]   God listened first and then he provide help
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.900]   and then he empowered the child by saying
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.460]   that you will become valid tomorrow.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.980]   Now, when we listen to Maggie's story,
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.340]   we next thing to do is to put her into a community.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:08.900]   The last thing you want to do
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.020]   to somebody who is vulnerable is to isolate them.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.100]   So at the road program,
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:16.020]   we ensure that our refugees and asylum seekers
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.180]   are in good community where they can care for one another
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.660]   and they can love and care and support each other.
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.820]   So we put Maggie into what we call our latest group.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.140]   So Maggie was so happy when she came.
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:28.740]   After being rejected by the community,
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.700]   he came to Branches of Hope and found a community.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.620]   And one day he said this to us,
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:38.620]   "When I am with the ladies, I feel loved and cared."
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.140]   That is what we want to hear
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.500]   from our refugee and asylum seekers.
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.820]   Then from there, we start to empower Maggie
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.500]   to become a leader in her own community.
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.700]   We send her into leadership training programs
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.460]   and we ensure that Maggie is able to do something
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:56.140]   for herself as she goes out to serve the local community.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.220]   Now we can also support people directly and indirectly.
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.100]   A way to empower somebody indirectly
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.180]   is to empower somebody next to them.
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.980]   If you look in the story of Hager, right,
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:07.540]   God said, "I hear the cry of your son."
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.380]   He empowered the son by doing that,
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.980]   he also empowered the mother.
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:14.740]   So for us, this approach, we empowered Maggie's daughter
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.700]   by sending her to kindergarten,
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.620]   thanks to our kindergarten program.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:22.020]   And Maggie was so happy to see her child being empowered,
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.980]   know that her child got a future.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.300]   By empowering her child and Maggie together,
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.820]   both of them were so happy
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.540]   that Maggie said this to us one day,
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.860]   "Now I have peace of mind
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.340]   "because my kids can go to school.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.460]   "This allows me to fight for her right."
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.860]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:43.100]   You empower the kids, but you give the mom power
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.460]   to fight for her right.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:47.500]   And that is where social reforms comes in.
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:48.820]   Social reform comes when we stand up
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.540]   to fight for the right of the people,
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:51.900]   not just us fighting,
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.180]   we have to fight together with the marginalized.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.340]   And then we change the whole society mindset
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.540]   about those who are marginalized in our city.
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:01.940]   - Thank you for sharing that, Roy.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.300]   I think it's also really important
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.780]   to come back to what you were just saying.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.580]   Care is not only about material goods,
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.780]   care is also about spiritual needs,
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:11.940]   it's about emotional needs,
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.580]   it's about being heard as a person.
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.820]   So thank you for pointing that out as well.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.500]   And also our appreciation to Maggie for her courage
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.420]   in sharing that story today.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.780]   Let's have a round of applause for Maggie and Amala.
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:26.940]   (audience applauding)
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.620]   Now, I'm sure there's many of you here today
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.300]   who after listening to these stories
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.860]   are probably inspired and feel a bit of passion
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:40.780]   to become involved yourselves.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.060]   And therefore might be asking yourself
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.620]   what might be the best way to do that?
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:49.500]   How can I become a voice for the marginalized?
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.260]   If you are the kind of person
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.180]   who doesn't just want to say that bow shot away,
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:56.700]   if you want to draw near, if you want to listen,
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.340]   I think my colleagues here can give you a couple pointers
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.460]   on how to do that.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:04.540]   So, Michelle and Roy, how can people,
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:07.300]   if they feel led by the spirit,
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:11.220]   how can they become involved in telling those stories?
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.340]   Michelle, why don't we start with your pointers?
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:14.700]   - Sure.
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.780]   I believe that everyone has a place in the society
[00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:20.540]   to bring positive impact.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.700]   So the first thing that you can do
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.860]   is that you can volunteer with us.
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.620]   If you have any special talents that you would love to share
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.700]   come to contact us, go to talk to our staff outside.
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.620]   Having the power to control our life
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.580]   is what dignity is all about.
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:42.260]   So at Branches of Hope, we value the self-agency
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.460]   for the marginalized community.
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:48.980]   As Roy said, empowerment brings dignity.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:52.860]   So you can offer your talents to our clients.
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.500]   For the case in point,
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.460]   the dress that I'm wearing today
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:58.780]   is made by one of our clients.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.860]   So they are already talented enough,
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.820]   but you can join us to tell them
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:07.100]   that the better future is possible.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.980]   And secondly, you all have your own voice.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:14.380]   You all have your own voice and power to share.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.580]   So you can be our advocate,
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:20.660]   you can become the influencer for us.
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:24.020]   So there is a very convenient opportunities here.
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:29.020]   So if you tune into Branches of Hope's social media page,
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:32.340]   you will find that on 30th of July,
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.620]   it would be a World Day Against Trafficking.
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:38.580]   We launched a campaign called Give Survivors a Voice.
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:42.820]   You can join our campaign and become the influencer
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.300]   to bring the positive change to the world.
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.100]   And lastly, of course,
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:54.100]   if you don't have the time to contribute or to give to us,
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:56.540]   then you can donate to us.
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.660]   It's always welcome, right?
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:03.100]   And so you can organize a fundraiser,
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:06.540]   you can donate to our program to support us
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:10.500]   so that we are able to support the vulnerable.
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.660]   - Thank you very much for that, Michelle.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.980]   So I think what you've touched upon are volunteering
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:17.260]   and obviously using our own platforms
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.060]   as a means for raising awareness
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.420]   and spreading knowledge about these things,
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.780]   and of course, fundraising.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.220]   Roy, do you have any points you'd like to add to that?
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:28.820]   - Of course, one of the point is to donate, right?
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:32.700]   You know, we need money to run our ministries and our work.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.140]   And I also want you to invite
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.460]   to be an agent of inclusion,
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.660]   which means you have to try to open up your space
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.060]   to include refugees into your circle.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:41.940]   And how does that happen?
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.860]   Number one, pray.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:44.940]   You know, as Christians,
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.940]   we have to pray before we take any step.
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:48.500]   So the more you pray for the refugees
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.340]   and victim of human trafficking,
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.260]   you come closer to them.
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.260]   And secondly, is to invite them, is to get to know them.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.500]   Now, when you pray to them, you got to know them,
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.260]   know their stories and their background.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.580]   And when you know them,
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:02.540]   you want to advocate on their behalf
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.700]   by sharing this with other people around you.
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.540]   Don't go to the street to fight for your right,
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:08.180]   but you can share it with your neighbor,
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.420]   your colleague in the office,
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.020]   as well as somebody that you do business with.
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:12.220]   After that business deal, you can go like,
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:15.100]   "Hey, look, I want to tell something about refugees
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.540]   and asylum seekers in Hong Kong."
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:17.780]   That would be very beautiful.
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.940]   And with that together,
[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:21.820]   we can make refugee voice heard in this city.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:22.660]   - Perfect.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.700]   Thank you very much, Roy.
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:27.100]   I think, you know, there's probably a deep impression
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.940]   that what you've shared today has left on many of those
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.620]   who have joined us today.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.860]   And I really like this idea
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.180]   of becoming an agent of inclusion.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.740]   I hope this list that you guys see up on the slide,
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.260]   that there's something there for everybody,
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.180]   and that even the smallest bit of action
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.580]   will certainly, you know,
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:47.420]   help us serve the greater good in this sense.
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.020]   Please, let's have another round of applause
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.140]   for our amazing colleagues, Roy and Michelle.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:54.860]   (audience applauding)
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:55.740]   And so with that,
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:58.420]   we would love to return to the stories of Maggie and Amala
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.140]   and see how they turned out.
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:06.180]   - Without a job and a home,
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.940]   I managed to receive basic support from organizations,
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.340]   including Branches of Hope.
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.940]   More importantly, the team assisted me
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.860]   with my medical needs
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:20.340]   and was there when I needed somebody to talk to.
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:23.780]   They also provided workshops and activities
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:26.700]   that helped equip me with the confidence
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.180]   and knowledge for the future.
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:33.700]   - There's so many expenses that come with raising a child,
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:35.420]   and it's especially difficult
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:37.300]   when you're a non-refoulement claimant
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.300]   and not allowed to work.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.180]   But with Branches of Hope's assistance,
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:43.460]   my daughter's educational needs are met,
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:47.100]   and we receive assistance with food and other necessities.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:48.780]   I was introduced to a ladies' group
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:51.660]   and found a community where I feel like I belong to.
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:53.940]   We share the same struggles
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.100]   and care for each other like a big family.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:01.660]   - Receiving help from STOP and Branches of Hope
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:04.460]   was important because their assistance
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:09.460]   and their presence helped me feel more mentally calm.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.660]   It helped having somebody to talk to
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.340]   so I can process my experiences
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:17.900]   and make me feel heard and understood.
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:23.260]   Having a calm mind, along with the help and compassion
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:26.820]   I have received, empowered me to help other people
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.900]   who are facing similar situations,
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:32.940]   especially those who are experiencing physical abuse.
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:36.260]   I can direct them to the authorities and organizations
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.020]   who can assist them.
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:40.500]   During the pandemic, I was able to help
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:43.220]   contact organizations for supplies
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:46.820]   and helping others find medical assistance.
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:51.380]   - Because of the hardships that I've experienced,
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.740]   the community I've developed, and my faith's teachings,
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:58.140]   I've been very passionate about helping the less fortunate.
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:00.420]   So for example, during the pandemic,
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:02.540]   I went out into my neighborhood streets
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:05.260]   and together with my daughter and community,
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.020]   we shared meals with the homeless people
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.020]   and prayed with them.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:12.660]   - In the future, I want to become a helping hand
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.940]   for people in need, especially those who are applying
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:19.300]   to be migrant domestic workers overseas.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.820]   I want to equip them with the necessary knowledge
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:23.940]   of what to do and who to contact
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.660]   in the event that abuse happens.
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:32.300]   - My hope for the future is just to live a peaceful life.
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.020]   But more importantly, I hope that my daughter
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.300]   will be treated with dignity and respect
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:40.540]   and receive the proper status in Hong Kong that she deserves.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:46.900]   (audience applauding)
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:53.300]   - You know, even though I work for Branches of Hope,
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:57.180]   the stories of our clients, you know,
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:01.020]   hearing their voices never ceases to amaze me.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.180]   And there are many stories like this one.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:07.100]   I truly hope that as we embark on this
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:08.460]   Branches of Hope Awareness Month,
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:13.460]   that you too will be moved by the stories of those we serve.
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:17.820]   Not just today, not just this month, but always.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:21.420]   There are many thousands of Maggies and Imalas
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:26.420]   in our home Kong and many millions of Ishmaels worldwide.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:30.940]   So may I once again invite you all to be inspired
[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:34.220]   by Genesis chapter 21 and become agents of inclusion.
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.660]   Let's not stay a bow shot away.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:41.180]   Instead, let's draw near, let's listen,
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.660]   let's give that life-giving water.
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.460]   Whether it is by donating or organizing fundraisers,
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:48.940]   by spreading the word in your networks,
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.860]   by volunteering your time and your expertise,
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:55.540]   by befriending those we serve and becoming their advocates,
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:59.540]   by being ferocious prayer warriors, or all of the above.
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:02.100]   We value your contribution, but more importantly,
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.700]   our clients value your contributions.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:07.780]   Please don't hesitate to come and talk to my colleagues
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:10.060]   at our booth outside after the service,
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:13.980]   and feel free to come seek us out with your questions,
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:16.820]   with your ideas and your support.
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:17.660]   Thank you.
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.740]   - Wonderful.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:24.700]   One of the best ways that we could finish our service today
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:27.540]   is by doing something that means so much
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.100]   to us as a community.
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:31.820]   When we get to celebrate one of our asylum seekers
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:35.140]   and refugees who are actually able to be welcomed
[00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:37.780]   by a new country overseas.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.860]   And you know, this happens from time to time,
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:43.340]   and it's happened for one of our dear families recently.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:46.260]   They're leaving tomorrow to go to Canada,
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.980]   to be resettled there.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:50.140]   And we thought the best way to finish our service
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:54.060]   is to pray for them, and just to have their story heard
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:55.340]   as we close our time.
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:58.580]   And I'm gonna invite Roy back to lead us in that time.
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.940]   And I wonder whether we would all just stand together
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:01.780]   as we do this.
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.340]   - Let me invite Godan and your family,
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:06.700]   please come forward, just join us on the stage.
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.700]   Godan have really been with us for a very long time,
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.220]   for almost seven years.
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:12.500]   And during that time, she will serve as champions
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.900]   in all Sunday services, she was in the Arise Fellowship,
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.180]   attended our Bible school,
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:19.340]   volunteered in Mawa Easter Egg Hunt,
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.380]   and also joined a tribe, a group here at the Vine.
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.740]   Now they're about to leave, please come this way.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.060]   And Godan, I want to just ask Godan to share
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:29.380]   one or two words with the congregation
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:32.580]   of how God have guided her in Hong Kong.
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:42.260]   - Good morning, everyone.
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:50.340]   I really thanks God this morning for this opportunity.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:55.500]   As the word today from our pastor,
[00:59:55.500 --> 01:00:00.500]   I'm always surprised with God.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:07.020]   Because the word of today really concern our life in Hong Kong.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:14.740]   I will not forget first time in this church, Vine Church,
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:20.780]   in that corner, that corner you see there,
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.060]   I always cry there.
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:28.700]   When I, first time, and always,
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:32.980]   when I'm in this church, I was just crying.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:41.500]   God hear and respond.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:47.940]   Today I proclaim and I thanks God because He responded.
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:52.300]   And He saw my tears.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:57.300]   And really, I feel just, I can cry again because of...
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:09.620]   I thanks everyone, I thanks the Vine Church was my home,
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:14.620]   I can say, because you really supported us,
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:22.740]   spiritually, financially, and emotionally.
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:27.500]   Thank you so much.
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:32.500]   Today I'm saying goodbye because tomorrow
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.740]   we need to leave the country.
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:40.740]   And I will say, just keep this heart
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:44.540]   and this way to support
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:50.300]   and be a part of God.
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:52.100]   Thank you so much. - Yeah.
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:54.420]   (audience applauding)
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.940]   - That was beautiful, Gordance.
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:02:00.660]   So let us pray for this family as they go.
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.860]   Gordance actually send a request prayer for us,
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:06.380]   is for a smooth transition into the new place.
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:09.700]   Pray for strength and wisdom to deal with cultural shock,
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:12.820]   a good friends and community over in Canada,
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.740]   and also peace during this transition.
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.660]   That was her prayer request that she sent to us.
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.100]   So all of you stretch your hands towards Gordance
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.340]   and just pray into your heart for about a minute
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.580]   and I will wrap it up with a round of prayer.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:27.700]   - Thank you, Jesus, come on, Jesus.
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.100]   (soft music)
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:38.580]   - Dear Lord, we join our voices with the angels in heaven
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:41.620]   and lay our hands on this family of Gordance,
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.260]   as they go and hear it.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.220]   We pray, Almighty God, that you will send your angels
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:50.060]   concerning you to guide them on their ways.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:53.140]   We pray that God will cover you with his feather
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:56.100]   and under his wings you will find refuge.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.900]   We trust you in your shield, O God, and armor.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.660]   You do not need to fear terror of night
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.780]   or arrow that flay during the day,
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:08.300]   for God is your hiding place.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.500]   He will protect you from trouble,
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.460]   he will surround you with songs of victory.
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.660]   The Lord says, "I will guide you along
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.860]   the best path of your life.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:21.060]   I will advise you and watch over you."
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:23.500]   May the Lord keep you from all harm,
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.660]   God, us and your family, and watch over your life.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.860]   May the Lord keep watching over you as you come
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:33.580]   and as you go, both now and forever.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.260]   We pray this in Jesus' mighty name, come, we all say.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.100]   - Amen. - Amen.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:37.940]   - Amen.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.860]   (congregation applauding)
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.100]   - Bless you, A.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:49.220]   Bless you, B.A., bless you guys, bless you guys.
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.060]   All right, I know we've gone a little bit long,
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:55.140]   but I wanna do one more thing for you.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:55.980]   Is that okay?
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.420]   Oh, tough, we're gonna do it anyway.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.020]   It says at the end of the story,
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:04.100]   when Hagar has had this amazing moment with God,
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.500]   and God says, "I hear your son," verse 19,
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.940]   it says, "God then opened her eyes."
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.500]   Say that again, "God opened her eyes
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.420]   so she could see a well of water.
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.740]   So she went there, filled her skim of water,
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.380]   and gave the boy a drink."
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:21.620]   My prayer for you is that God would open your eyes.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.660]   I pray that He would open the ears of your hearts
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.180]   so you would hear the vulnerable and the marginalised
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:29.540]   that would not stay a bow shot away.
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:30.380]   Let me pray for us.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.740]   Father, we thank You so much
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:33.580]   that we get to do this together.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.940]   Thank You so much for the work of Branches of Hope,
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:38.540]   but more importantly, the work of Your Spirit.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.500]   The work of Your Spirit,
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.220]   that it's a work in every person here for Your glory.
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.900]   We thank You for this.
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:45.740]   In Jesus' name.
