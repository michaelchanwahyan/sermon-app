1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Merry Christmas, everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Alright, alright.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 You didn't have to. That's so nice.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 So, a week before Christmas in 2014,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 a friend of mine who works for Nike reached out to me and she said,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 "We're having an event, a special lunch event,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 to say thank you to all our clients, our customers,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 our friends of the brand."

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 She said, "I'd love you to come to the lunch."

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And I said to her, "Look," you know,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 "my thinking was, look, Christmas is a busy time for us pastors.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I don't always can fit in lots of social stuff around Christmas.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 This lunch was really not something that really was a priority for me."

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 So I reached back out to her and I said, "Look, I thank you so much for your invite.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm not really sure if this is going to work for me."

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 And she's like, "Andrew," she's like,

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 "there's a very, very famous person coming to this lunch."

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 She says, "This person is so famous

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 and I will arrange it that you will get to personally meet with this famous person."

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I was like, "Who is this famous person?"

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 She's like, "I'm not going to tell you who the famous person is.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 All you need to know is that they're very, very famous

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 and you will want to meet them."

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 This is like a marketing technique of Nike, okay?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 This is how they get people to their lunches, right?

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 So I was intrigued. It worked, right?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I was intrigued. I'm like, "This priority has now gone up in my priority list."

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So I signed up for the event and a week or so later, I went along to the event.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I got there early and it was one of those really fancy events

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 where there's lots of tables and you're assigned a specific table.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 When you get to your table, there's a little name tag for you on the table.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 So I got to my table, I walked around, I found my name tag

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 and I looked at the name tag next to me and I could not believe what I saw.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 The name tag next to me read "David Beckham."

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 David Beckham, people!

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 David Beckham is going to be sitting next to me for an--

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 He's so lucky. Can you imagine how lucky David Beckham is?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 To sit next to me? Wow!

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 What a day for Beckham.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 But I couldn't believe that David Beckham was going to sit next to me.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 My heart rate started to go up. My heart rate was pounding.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I was like, "What am I going to talk to David Beckham about?"

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And I thought about all my sporting hero moments of my life.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Very short list.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 But I did actually play international football.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I actually played international football for Hong Kong and I scored a goal.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I'm like, "I'm going to tell David Beckham about my international football experience."

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And then I realized that's the dumbest thing to ever say

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 because he's just going to come back with, "Well, the time that I played in the World Cup."

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 So I was super nervous.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 I was like, "I'm not sure what I'm going to say to this guy,

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 but how exciting that I'm finally going to meet David Beckham."

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I've been a fan of David Beckham for a long, long time.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 He's a British sporting icon, of course.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I don't support Manchester United.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 But I do support Newcastle United, and they are the greatest football club ever.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 But even though he wasn't from my team, he was a sporting icon.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Couldn't wait to meet him.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 So anyway, everybody was coming into this lunch.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I'm feeling like I'm the guy who's sitting next to the famous guy, so I'm feeling like all cool.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Everybody's coming in, taking their seats.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Obviously, the seat next to me is staying empty.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I figured David would just come up on stage, they'd introduce him, maybe take some photos.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 He might share some words.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And then he was going to come and sit down next to me.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 So we all sit down for lunch.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Everybody else on my table sat down.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 The space is next to me.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And this guy rushes in. He's kind of late.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 He's a little bit overweight, kind of a white guy.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And he comes in, and he's looking for his place.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 And he comes to our table, and he's walking around the table trying to find his name tag.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And he comes to exactly where I am and right next to me.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And he looks at it, and he turns to me.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 He goes, "Oh, hello. I'm sorry I'm late. My name is David Beckham."

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I'm like, "No, it is not! Your name cannot be David Beckham!"

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 It turns out that David Beckham is not an international football star.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 He's a chartered accountant.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 That was the David Beckham that sat down next to me for lunch.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I won't even tell you who the famous person was because they weren't really that famous at all.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And I got to sit next to a chartered accountant who told me over lunch about his three, what I thought were quite spoiled kids.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And it really was an absolute nightmare.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 It was probably the most biggest disappointing lunch that I've ever had.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 It was a huge disappointment.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Why am I telling you a story about a huge disappointment on Christmas morning?

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Because Christmas morning surely is about the most amazing thing, right?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 It's about the fact that Jesus was born.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 It's about the fact that our Savior's come.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 That it's a time to glorify and celebrate and worship as we are gathered here today.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Why would I talk about the disappointment of meeting somebody that you thought you were going to meet,

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 but it didn't turn out to be the one that you were hoping to meet?

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 It's because actually on the original Christmas day, some 2,000 years ago,

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 a sense of disappointment was actually how a lot of people in Israel felt when Jesus was born.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 So you've got to remember that they were waiting for a very long time for their Messiah.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 They were so excited about meeting their Messiah.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 They had a David Beckham, if you will.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 The one who would come in and take over the world.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 The one that they believed would actually finally get rid of the Romans once and for all.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 In fact, their prophets from old had spoken about the day when the Messiah would come.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 They had a term for it. It was called the Day of Yahweh.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And when the Messiah came, the way they spoke about it was,

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 He's going to be like a mighty warrior, like a warrior king who will ride into Jerusalem on a chariot filled with flames.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And as He comes in, He will bring an everlasting peace to the world.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 So the evil Greco-Roman Empire will be banished forever.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And it will be like this Messiah will come with an army of angels,

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 and they will fight a battle against the Romans.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 The Romans will be defeated.

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And what will be established will be the Jewish and Israel Empire forever and ever. Amen.

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 That's what they were looking for.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 That's what they were expecting.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 They were looking for a Messiah who would be a warring king.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Now, you can understand why they were expecting this.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Imagine what it would be like to be a minority group in a majority culture

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 that is constantly telling you that power is held in those who are the strongest,

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 who have the armies, and who are oppressive in how they do that power on everybody else.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 In the first century, the Israels were under the oppressive regime of the Roman Empire.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 They were suffering under that regime.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 They didn't have the freedoms that they wanted to have,

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 and they wanted their Messiah to come and overthrow an empire that was around them.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And because that empire was all built on war, on violence, on oppression,

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 and the use of power to oppress,

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 it's understandable that the Jewish people were looking for a Messiah

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 who would be able to war himself, defeat the battles and the armies of the Romans,

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 and establish Israel forever.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 So if that was the David Beckham you were expecting to meet,

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 imagine how surprised you were on Christmas Day.

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 When there wasn't a warring king that broke from the clouds on a chariot

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 to overthrow the Roman Empire,

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 and instead there was a child, a baby,

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 but not just any baby, not a baby born in a castle

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 or a baby born in an incredible temple somewhere,

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 but a baby born in a smelly, stinky cave under a house.

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 That's apparently the Messiah.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 So the Jewish people struggled to understand this.

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Now interestingly, the way that Luke presents the arrival of the Messiah,

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 he plays on this tension that there is

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 between what the Jewish people's expectations were

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 and what the reality was in the coming person of Jesus as a child.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Let me pick up the story for you from Luke 2,

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 part of the story that Elizabeth just read to us a moment ago,

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 starting in verse 10.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 "But the angels said to them, 'Do not be afraid, speaking to the shepherds.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 For today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to you.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 He is the Christ, the Messiah, the Anointed One, the Lord.'

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 The angels do come on that day, just as the Jewish people were expecting,

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 but not an army of angels to overthrow the Romans,

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 a choir of angels singing songs.

149
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And these angels speak to a group of shepherds,

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 not again the famous people that you'd expect God to speak to,

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 but outcasts, nomads, those that were almost rejected by their own people.

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 It is these outcasts that God decides to make the first announcement

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 of the arrival of His Son to.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And the angels show up and say all the right things about the Messiah.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 First of all, they say, 'This is good news.'

156
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 They declare good news because the news is of hope,

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 and the ancient prophets of old had spoken about the news

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 being a good news for all people.

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 They mention that He's born in the town of David, the city of David,

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 which was their belief, that the Messiah would come from the Davidic dynasty,

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 the line of King David.

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Eventually the Messiah would come from the bloodline of David,

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 and here they are telling the shepherds that the Messiah has come

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 in the town of David.

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Then they say the Messiah has arrived, has come, this anointed one, the Lord.

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 So you can imagine that the shepherds are super excited at this point,

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 and they're still expecting to go into Bethlehem, the town of David,

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 and meet some mighty warring king who's about to kick off some violent war

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 so that the Romans would be defeated.

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Notice what then, in the midst of that tension and expectation,

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 the shepherds say.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Verse 12, "This will be a sign to you.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 You will find a baby wrapped in cloths, lying in a manger."

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 You could almost imagine the shepherds going,

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 'Oh my gosh, the Messiah has come. I can't wait.'

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 'This will be a sign to you. You will see a baby wrapped in cloths

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 and lying in the manger.'

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I'm sorry?

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Sorry, can you just say that last bit again?

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 We got you up to that point, but what was that last part?

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 The Messiah is going to be a baby?

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 A baby wrapped in cloths, lying in a poor manger?

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 That's not quite what we ordered.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 You ever been to a restaurant and received something that you have not ordered?

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 I can almost imagine the shepherds going,

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 'Could we speak to the manager, please?'

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Like this is not what they expected.

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Now, I want you to see that actually this is everything

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 that God is trying to communicate on Christmas Day.

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And as we gather to celebrate Christmas Day today,

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 it's actually this that we are gathering to celebrate.

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Notice what the angels say right at the start.

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It says, "This will be a sign to you."

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 "This will be a sign to you."

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Now, how we so often interpret that normally

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 is that the angels are basically saying,

197
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 "Here are some divine directions to get to Bethlehem

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 so that you can find the right person who's the Messiah."

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 "This will be the directions for you. You'll find a baby in wraps in cloths."

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 That's not what they're saying.

201
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 They're not trying to give them some like directions to Bethlehem.

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 In fact, the word that's in the Greek, the original language for sign here,

203
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 literally translates to something that is beyond,

204
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 something that points to something beyond.

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 It's the same word that Luke's going to go on to use

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 to speak about Jesus' miracles.

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 He'll say, "These are a sign."

208
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 He does these miracles as a sign

209
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 because they point beyond themselves to the coming power of the kingdom

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 and the nature and the character of God.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Well, the angels use the same word here.

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 They say, "Here is a sign to you."

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Something that points beyond the reality of what it is.

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 In other words, the Messiah hasn't come as a warring king as you expected.

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 He's actually come as a baby,

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 wrapped in cloths, lying in a manger,

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 and that is a sign to you.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 It's a message to you that points beyond what it is.

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And the question we should ask ourselves on Christmas Day is,

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 what's the message?

221
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 What's the sign?

222
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Well, think about it for a moment.

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 What is the sign of a child being born?

224
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I mean, a child comes into this world completely defenseless,

225
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 completely vulnerable.

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 A child is born into this world completely at the mercy of its parents

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 to be fed, clothed, cared for, looked after,

228
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 completely vulnerable and exposed.

229
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 A child comes into this world completely at the need of others.

230
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 You could not get a more different picture

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 between a warring Caesar on a chariot

232
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 and a poor, defenseless child.

233
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And that, the angels are saying, is a sign to you.

234
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 A sign to you that God's ways are different from the ways of this world.

235
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 A sign to you that actually power is different in God's kingdom

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 than the power that is seen in this world.

237
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 In fact, I would put it like this,

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 that the Christmas story is that true power, victory and hope

239
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 is not found in the expected strengths of the powers of this world,

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 but the unexpected fragility of the innocence of a child.

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 That, my friends, is the heart of the Christmas story.

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 That if you want to know where true power lies,

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 if you want to know where actually hope and salvation can come from,

244
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 it doesn't come from the worldly structures and definitions of power.

245
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 It doesn't come from political context.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 It doesn't come from armies and bombs and guns and drones and war.

247
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 That's not where power is found.

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 The true power that sets people free, that raises from the dead,

249
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 that resurrects people, that gives people hope,

250
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 that pays the price for sin,

251
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 that power is found in the innocence of the weak,

252
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 and it's the weak who become strong in God's kingdom.

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 That's a sign to you, the angels say.

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 A sign to you that you need to shift your thinking about where power lies.

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 A sign for you to understand that if you're a Christian,

256
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 if you hold the name of Christ,

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 then you have to be on the side of the innocent,

258
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 on the side of the vulnerable, on the side of the marginalized,

259
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 on the side of the poor,

260
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 on the side of the ones that are rejected by everybody else,

261
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 because that's how Christ came into the world.

262
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And if Christ comes into the world as a sign to us,

263
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 we have to lean into that side of the world.

264
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 We are the ones who should stand against

265
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 the ways in which power is manipulated in the systems of this world

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 and instead glorify in the subversive, table-flipping nature

267
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 of God's kingdom and the trueness of power.

268
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Think of it this way.

269
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 God's way of saving the world is a child wrapped in cloth,

270
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 not a warrior wrapped in armor.

271
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And that, my friends, is a very important message for our world today.

272
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 If you think about over the things that are happening in 2023

273
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 as we draw this year to a close,

274
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 if you have a look around the world at the wars and the political infighting,

275
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 if you look at the divisiveness of communities,

276
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 if you look at the way that hate is being used more and more,

277
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 if we look at some of the darkness that there still is here in the world,

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 this message of Christmas should ring true for us more now

279
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 than perhaps ever before.

280
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And although the expectations of the Jewish people in that day

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 was to find something that fitted more into the world's perspective,

282
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 God shows up and says, "No, we Christians do things slightly differently.

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 There's an alternative way of thinking, an alternative way of being,

284
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 an alternative way of living."

285
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And that should still be a sign to the world that Jesus has come.

286
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 And so in a way, there's a fire that gets placed within us

287
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 if we're Christians at Christmas time,

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 that any time we actually reach out to a vulnerable, marginalized community

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 and we help them and serve them and love them,

290
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 it's a sign to the world that Jesus has come.

291
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Any time we help the oppressed get freedom and new life,

292
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 any time we work with the innocent

293
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 and help them to be found that they are not guilty,

294
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 we are a sign that Jesus is here.

295
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Any time war ceases,

296
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 any time power that is being abused is stripped from someone,

297
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 any time the vulnerable find safety and home,

298
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 it's a sign that Jesus is still here.

299
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I love the way that the Apostle Paul speaks of the incarnation of Jesus at Christmas time,

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 writing to the church, and a church that was heavily oppressed,

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 and actually a church that was under a huge amount of persecution.

302
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Here's how Paul writes to his church.

303
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 He says, "Your attitude," in Philippians 2, "should be the same as Christ Jesus,

304
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 who being in the very nature of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,

305
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 but instead made himself," notice this, "nothing,

306
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 taking on the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness,

307
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 and being found in the appearance of a man," notice, "he humbled himself

308
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 and became obedient to death, even death on a cross,

309
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 the very weapon that the Greco-Roman Empire used to keep themselves in power,

310
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 would become the very thing that Jesus would humbly submit himself to,

311
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 so that he could reveal true power to the world.

312
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place,

313
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 and gave him the name that is above every name,

314
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,

315
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 in heaven and on earth and under the earth,

316
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,

317
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 to the glory of the Father."

318
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Isn't that so beautiful?

319
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 He's saying, "This is the incarnation.

320
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 This is a sign to you," he's saying, "Church,

321
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 that God decided not to hold power like the world holds power,

322
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 but to humble himself, strip himself of power, if you will,

323
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 come down to this world as a defenseless child,

324
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 to be a man amongst us, so through that he would submit himself

325
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 to the will of his Father, be raised from the dead,

326
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 take the sins of the world on his shoulders,

327
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 pay the price so that we would be free."

328
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 This is the story of the gospel,

329
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 and it starts not with a warring king in a fiery chariot,

330
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 but with an innocent child in a dirty stable.

331
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 It's a profound invitation for Christians on Christmas

332
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 to declare a different spirit in this world,

333
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 a different way of understanding power.

334
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I wonder if you could think about it this way.

335
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Imagine if the angels came today,

336
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 maybe here's some of the sort of things they might say.

337
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 "This will be a sign to you.

338
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 You will find a church wrapped in the pain of its community,

339
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 lying in the poorest of the poorest communities, bringing hope."

340
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Or maybe the angel would say, "And this will be a sign to you.

341
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 You will find believers in Christ Jesus

342
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 wrapped in the hope of the gospel, lying in the marketplace

343
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 and the workplaces and their families

344
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 and their spheres of influencing, offering hope."

345
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Or maybe I would say, "And you will find me,

346
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 and this will be a sign to you.

347
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 You'll find me wrapped too often in the cares

348
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 and the worries of this world,

349
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 but lying in the nurturing arms of my Father

350
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 and finding my shalom and peace there."

351
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 This, my friends, is the story of Christmas.

352
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And Paul says, "Your attitude, your mindset,

353
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 the way you think should be like this,

354
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 not the warring, powerful, mighty thing that the world would say,

355
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 but the innocent, weak thing that through God is made strong."

356
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 This is why Jesus's beatitudes are so important to us.

357
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Those who mourn will be comforted.

358
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Those who've been rejected will be welcomed.

359
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Those who are poor will be found rich in Him,

360
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 but those who are rich will be stripped down.

361
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 The reversal of the heart of God

362
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 to take the broken things of this world

363
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 and make them true and strong.

364
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 That's what we gather together today to celebrate.

365
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 And so my encouragement to you on Christmas Day,

366
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 and I pray that this would inspire you and fill you with hope,

367
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 is that if you are to live out the Christmas message,

368
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 it is to live out that message,

369
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 that we are people who see power in a different way.

370
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 We are people who see love in a different way.

371
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And we are people who carry a message that is truly good news.

372
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 May we walk towards the vulnerable, marginalize the poor.

373
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 We walk towards those who need the message the most

374
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 and offer them true hope.

375
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 That's the mission of Christmas.

376
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 It's what we gather to celebrate today.

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And as we worship Him and sing,

378
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 and as we open the presents later on

379
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 and have the incredible food for lunch that we'll have,

380
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 may we do so in a spirit of true gratefulness

381
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 for the humility of a God who shows us a different way.

382
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 That, my friends, is Christmas.

383
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Amen.

384
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Would you stand with me?

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I would love to pray with you.

386
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Let's stand together.

387
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Father, I'm just so grateful for each person here today,

388
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 on Christmas Day.

389
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 And Father, while of course we long

390
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 to meet the David Beckhams of this world,

391
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 we're grateful.

392
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 We're grateful for every person.

393
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 The people who are standing around us right now,

394
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 the people in our neighborhoods,

395
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 our apartment buildings, our communities,

396
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 the people in our offices and our workplaces,

397
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 the people that you've surrounded us with,

398
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 we are grateful for them.

399
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Father, I pray that you would put a fire in the vine

400
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 and a fire amongst us as your people.

401
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 To be people who love justice,

402
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 people who fight for the vulnerable,

403
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 people who stand for the nonviolent gospel

404
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 that you have given to us in the infancy of a child.

405
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Lord, I pray that this would be our Christmas message,

406
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 that there is the great hope in the world,

407
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 that the darkness is dark,

408
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 but it has not overcome us.

409
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 That there is, because of Christmas,

410
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 a light that has come into this world

411
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 in the form of an innocent, vulnerable child

412
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 to show us that despite everything happening for us,

413
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 God can meet us too.

414
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 In our own vulnerability,

415
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 in our own brokenness,

416
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 he can be there.

417
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Father, I pray for anyone here in this room

418
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 that maybe doesn't know you,

419
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 but maybe today they've been invited

420
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 by friends and family and they've come here

421
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 and they've heard a story and a message

422
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 about a God who does things differently

423
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 to what we see in this world.

424
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Lord, I pray that that message

425
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 would be an encouragement to them.

426
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And I pray that you would bring many

427
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 in this room today towards you.

428
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Father, we thank you that at Christmas,

429
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 we have this joyous sign

430
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 that you have not left the world

431
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 to spiral out of control,

432
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 but you have stepped in to bring hope.

433
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 That Jesus himself would go on to say,

434
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I've not come to kill and destroy,

435
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 but I've come to bring life and life abundant.

436
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I wanna pray, Lord, for every person

437
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 here at the Vine this year

438
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 that they would know and feel life and life abundant.

439
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And Lord, if there is anyone in here

440
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 who's feeling lowly,

441
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 who's feeling an outcast,

442
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 who's feeling vulnerable,

443
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 who's feeling overwhelmed,

444
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 I pray that they would know

445
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 that Jesus has humbled himself

446
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 and has stepped into the lowliest of places

447
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 so that he would know exactly

448
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 how they're feeling right now.

449
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And so that he would bring a comfort to say,

450
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 I've been there, I know what that's like.

451
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And if you come to me, I will give you peace.

452
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Thank you that the angels would declare

453
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 over the shepherds, peace on earth.

454
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And Lord, that's what we desire.

455
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 With all the wars that are happening,

456
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 with the political angst that is amongst us,

457
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 with so many divisive perspectives

458
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 that spew hate rather than love,

459
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 we pray peace on earth.

460
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And we pray this in the name of Jesus.

461
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Everyone says, amen, amen.

462
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Can we worship together?

463
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Let's continue to worship as a community.
