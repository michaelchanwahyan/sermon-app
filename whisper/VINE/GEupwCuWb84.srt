1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 Yeah, it's great to be with you.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,840
 As you already heard today is Branches of Hope Sunday.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,080
 For those of you who do not know, Branches of Hope was actually started by the Vine Church.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,840
 So this nonprofit organization was started by the Vine.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,940
 And so we're going to hear from them in a little bit excited about that.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,680
 Before we do that, I want to take a little bit time to prepare our hearts through God's

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,240
 word.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,160
 And to hear from God through his word, what is on his heart for justice in society.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,720
 So that we can align our hearts with that.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,040
 Does that sound good?

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,040
 Yes.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,060
 Okay, thank you.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,480
 So last week, we kicked off our God of Justice sermon series.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,680
 And in that series, we are in that message, we looked at the redemptive grand narrative

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,080
 of scripture.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:00,280
 And we saw that when we look at that narrative, that we can discover God's heart for justice.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:09,960
 And we also said that it is this narrative that gives us the reason, the motivation and

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,600
 the inspiration to carry out the vision of God's justice that he has for his people.

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,260
 And to do that as individuals, but to also do that as a church family together.

20
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,880
 And so when I, as I presented it, that narrative to you, we had some images.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,440
 I want to take you to those images.

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,340
 So here you see we were created for good.

23
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,480
 So God created us, we looked at Genesis.

24
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,160
 There was four relational contexts that we looked at.

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,720
 It was about a relation between us and God, us and ourselves, us and others, us and creation.

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,960
 And we said that everything was well, there was shalom, there was peace, and these relationships

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,760
 were flourishing and they were thriving.

28
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,480
 But then something happened.

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:06,080
 We said that sin entered the world and there was a breakdown in all those four relationships.

30
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,160
 We decided to rebel against God, and this is repeated by every single human being, even

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,120
 to this point, that we rebel against God.

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,140
 There's self-preservation over helping others.

33
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,340
 So we look out for ourselves first, and this is the default that we find ourselves in right

34
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,340
 now.

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,160
 And we looked at how these four relationships, how they're broken down, a relationship with

36
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,320
 God broke down, with ourselves, with others and creation.

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:39,160
 But then we said that God did not leave creation, he did not leave us in this mess, because

38
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,880
 that was not what he created us for.

39
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:50,160
 And there's a longer story of redemption, but we said that it culminates in Jesus' coming,

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,980
 that the righteous died for the unrighteous, for the wicked, for the sinners, which is

41
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,280
 all of us.

42
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,240
 There's brokenness in our lives where we seek out what is good for us at the cost of other

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:10,120
 people, and we sin against God, we sin against others, and we need Jesus to forgive us, to

44
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
 restore us.

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,040
 And so he came, he laid down his life so that we can become the kind of good that he desires

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,360
 for us, that we can become righteous and just people.

47
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,060
 And so this relationship between us and God is restored.

48
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,960
 But then with that, it is not just about us and Jesus.

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,240
 That is the most important thing, but it's not just about that.

50
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:39,640
 Being a Christian, being a person that believes in the gospel, it involves all four dimensions

51
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,320
 of this relational context, because God wants to restore all of them, and he wants us, his

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
 people to be part of it.

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:54,000
 So we said that we were sent together to heal, that the church of Jesus has been sent out

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,720
 by Jesus to bring healing into society, into all these facets.

55
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,960
 So let me talk briefly about that.

56
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,760
 We want to see relationships between people and God restored.

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,440
 We want to help people find their way back to God.

58
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,240
 We want to see relationships between people themselves restored, their identity, that

59
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,840
 they have peace even within themselves, which believe that God is the one who gives that.

60
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,440
 We want to see relationship between us and creation restored, because instead of being

61
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,320
 rulers and having dominion over creation in a way that honors God, that reflects his character,

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,840
 we have exploited creation, we have destroyed creation, and God wants us to be good stewards.

63
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,480
 He wants to restore that relationship so that we contribute to its flourishing, to its thriving.

64
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,080
 And then finally, we also are sent out to restore relationships between each other,

65
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,880
 between us and others.

66
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,080
 And that happens on an individual level, like one-on-one, but also on a societal level,

67
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,880
 where we want to see those relationships flourish and thrive.

68
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,400
 We want to address injustices and issues where we make other people's issues our issues,

69
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,920
 because we want them to live out all of God's purposes and not be squished down by society,

70
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,560
 by policies, by whatever else is going on, and so that all people can experience shalom

71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,120
 and flourish and thrive.

72
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,440
 And so that's what we are sent out as church to heal.

73
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,400
 God hasn't trusted us with this mission.

74
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,800
 And so this is something that is super important.

75
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,040
 And actually earlier, as Sherry was leading worship, I was thinking about this, that this

76
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,900
 just happens not because we try harder.

77
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,900
 This is not homework.

78
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,800
 No, you need to try harder.

79
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,720
 This is because the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, moves within our hearts and leads

80
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,020
 us to love those around us.

81
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,360
 And so if you're not feeling this right now, our starting point is just to pray, say, "Jesus,

82
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,360
 I'm not feeling this right now.

83
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,960
 Show me what is your will.

84
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
 Show me how to care.

85
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,360
 Show me how to love.

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,520
 Show me what you want to do.

87
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,800
 You move me."

88
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,560
 And so my prayer for us as a church is that we are this church that does this.

89
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:33,000
 But let me focus on what I want to briefly talk about, and that's the us and others today,

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,160
 particularly the injustices in society and God's heart for that.

91
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,200
 And so we're going to go to the book of Isaiah.

92
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,820
 Isaiah is one of the prophets in the Old Testament.

93
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,820
 He confronts his people.

94
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,880
 So I'm going to set the context.

95
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,480
 He confronted his people, God's people, Israel, who were set apart to be righteous and just,

96
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,520
 but they were failing in that.

97
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,040
 So he confronts his people through the prophet, and he speaks into their lives, and he says

98
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,600
 some things that are quite disturbing.

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,760
 And he's God's mouthpiece, so he's saying what God wants to say to his people.

100
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:11,800
 He's saying that he does not take pleasure in their worship.

101
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,960
 Their offerings are meaningless, and he hates it.

102
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,320
 Whoa.

103
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,880
 Can you imagine God saying that to us?

104
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
 What's going on?

105
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,720
 You know, what's happening here?

106
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,600
 And that's what we're going to look at.

107
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,640
 We're going to look at the reasons.

108
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,640
 So the first year in Isaiah 1, 15 through 17, it says this, "When you spread out your

109
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,000
 hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,920
 Even when you offer many prayers, I'm not listening.

111
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,640
 Your hands are full of blood."

112
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,800
 So we see, again, Israel is in this worship context, and God says, "I don't care about

113
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
 your prayers.

114
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
 I'm not listening.

115
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,320
 It doesn't matter how much you pray."

116
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,760
 But the reason is because their lives, their Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and

117
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,680
 so forth, their lives does not honor God.

118
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,360
 In their day-to-day actions, they're not giving God worship.

119
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,220
 You know, they're living unrighteous lives.

120
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,360
 And so God confronts them, and we're actually even told, we get a hint at what's going on.

121
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,600
 We don't know all the details, but it says, "Your hands are full of blood."

122
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:31,200
 Now this, of course, can straight up mean murder, that they have blood on their hands,

123
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:38,800
 but it can also entail being indirectly involved in the injustices that are happening in society,

124
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,640
 that they're just focused on their own life, and they don't care what's going on with their

125
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,560
 neighbors and with other people.

126
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,320
 And so God implicates them.

127
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,680
 He says, "Your neighbors are also your responsibility.

128
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,560
 It's not just about you and me.

129
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,080
 It's also about you and me and others."

130
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,800
 And God calls out Israel for not caring for their neighbors, because that is part of what

131
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,240
 it means to be the people of God, is to be about others, and to care about the issues

132
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,200
 and the challenges they're facing.

133
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,160
 And the same is true for us.

134
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,640
 As Christians, our responsibility goes beyond looking after ourselves and extends to our

135
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
 neighbors.

136
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,960
 It's not just me and Jesus, and that's it.

137
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,640
 It's me and Jesus, and me and others.

138
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,400
 Jesus cares about that we care about others in society.

139
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,680
 They're also our responsibilities.

140
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,400
 They're our brothers and our sisters, and we should care about what's going on in their

141
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,880
 lives and what injustices they face, because God cares about them.

142
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,760
 And as His image bearers, He wants us to be people who reflect His image, and who also

143
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,120
 care about those things that are going on.

144
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,880
 And we also have agency, there's things that we can do.

145
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,560
 Now for most of us, I think the challenge is that, for one, we're just busy, so we don't

146
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,880
 think about it.

147
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,400
 And then our default is that we take care of ourselves, maybe our family, our friends,

148
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,640
 and we might even not know what's going on.

149
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,960
 You know, what are the injustices and the issues right now in Hong Kong or in other

150
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
 countries?

151
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,940
 You know, what is going on?

152
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,880
 But God is saying, "This is our responsibility."

153
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,400
 And so then there's something that God does in verse 16, so let me continue.

154
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,220
 He calls them, He says, "Wash and make yourself clean.

155
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,200
 Take your evil deeds out of my sight.

156
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,560
 Stop doing wrong."

157
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,320
 So in other words, He calls them to repent, to turn around, to change their ways, to stop

158
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,280
 doing what they're doing, to start caring for their neighbors, to start caring about

159
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,680
 the injustices in society.

160
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,880
 And He calls them to turn around, so repentance always means that there's sorrow, that we

161
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,920
 realize there's conviction.

162
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,440
 We say, "I'm sorry, God," but it's not just enough to say sorry and then keep doing what

163
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
 you're doing.

164
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,580
 It's actually changing our ways, changing our lives, and living in a different way.

165
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,400
 And so He's saying, "Change the way you live."

166
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,800
 And then He tells them in verse 17, so we're going to look at that.

167
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,080
 He tells them how He wants them to live.

168
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,640
 And He says this, "Learn to do right, seek justice, defend oppressed, take up the cause

169
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,600
 of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow."

170
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,560
 And those are actually things that God does, what He's asking His people to do.

171
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,000
 He does take up the cause, He does plead, He does defend, and He wants us, His people,

172
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,200
 to do the same thing.

173
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,040
 Two things real quick that stood out to me.

174
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,440
 First, learn to do right.

175
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,920
 We don't actually automatically know what it means to do right.

176
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,760
 It actually takes time to learn and understand what it means to do right in God's eyes.

177
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,080
 That means we need to get to know His word, what God's word says about our neighbors.

178
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,480
 It means we need to understand injustice issues in our society.

179
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,920
 That means we learn from organizations like we're going to do from Branches of Hope.

180
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,280
 It means we learn from people who are experiencing these injustices, that we actually understand

181
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,960
 them, that we can have compassion, that we can enter into them.

182
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,120
 It means that we also can discern God's will, what His purpose is, and what it means to

183
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
 administer justice.

184
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,680
 And then, of course, we also need to learn how to defend, how to take up, and how to

185
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
 plead.

186
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
 How do you do that in Hong Kong?

187
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,680
 And what does that look like?

188
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,760
 And the second thing that stood out to me was seek justice.

189
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,560
 So we're not just meant to let the issues come to us.

190
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:47,120
 We're actually, as the body of Christ, as a church, meant to actively figure out who

191
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:56,200
 are the oppressed, who are the ones that are marginalized, and what can we do about it.

192
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,760
 And to seek justice also means to discern God's will for this group of people that are

193
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,800
 facing these situations.

194
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,880
 And then it also means action.

195
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,240
 To seek justice means action.

196
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,800
 It's not just talking beautifully, but it's then actually working out, fleshing out, how

197
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,120
 do we put things in action?

198
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,300
 How do we plead their case?

199
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,480
 How do we help?

200
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,680
 How do we change?

201
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,900
 How do we contribute to the shalom of society?

202
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,320
 And so that's what we're going to look at today.

203
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,080
 We're going to hear from Branches of Hope here in a minute.

204
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,380
 Right now, in just a moment, we're going to watch a video from Pastor Tony Reed.

205
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,380
 He's actually with us today.

206
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,680
 I know he doesn't want attention, but okay, do you mind giving us a little wave?

207
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
 There he is.

208
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,720
 Thank you.

209
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,920
 So for those of you who don't know, Tony is one of the founding pastors of the Vine Church,

210
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,400
 and you've seen John a lot, and so he, together with John, they co-pastored.

211
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,700
 And so he's going to share with us about the origin story of how Branches of Hope came

212
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
 to be.

213
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
 So let's watch this video.

214
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,700
 Let's do that now.

215
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:08,360
 I guess when we went into it at first, we were fairly simple in terms of our thinking

216
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,200
 of what we were trying to do.

217
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:17,380
 As we continued to understand what we were about, we had to provide a much wider range

218
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:28,120
 of services from financial support and resettlement, doing research, social engagement, empowerment,

219
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:38,480
 and in fact, a whole range of services that are suitable for marginalized communities.

220
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,640
 Social justice has been part of the church for a long time, right from the beginnings.

221
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:51,600
 But when we were just a small community within the basement of a hotel, meeting on Sundays

222
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,620
 only with maybe about 80 or 90 people, it was hard for us to put that into practice.

223
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,680
 But several years later, by the time we'd moved into our own premises, we realized that

224
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,920
 we had perhaps better facilities to offer what we would describe as a 24/7 service.

225
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,440
 And at that time, God provided an opportunity for us.

226
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,480
 Quite amazing.

227
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:25,640
 We had this letter from an asylum seeker who was being detained at the time, and he asked

228
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,280
 us if we would come and visit him.

229
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,560
 And so, of course, we felt this was the right thing to do to respond well to it.

230
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,320
 And we went to see him.

231
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,040
 We went through all the procedures of getting in and understanding how all of that worked.

232
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,240
 And we developed a relationship with him, visited him regularly.

233
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,160
 So when it came for the time for him to be released and others to be released, they asked

234
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,360
 if they could come to our church.

235
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,560
 And we said, "Yes, of course, we'd be delighted if you came."

236
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:06,680
 And the ministry of working with the asylum seekers has now grown into the ROAD program,

237
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:14,600
 which is part of Branches of Hope.

238
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:24,920
 We were asked to host a gala performance of a documentary film produced by another NGO,

239
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:32,240
 which showed the difficulties and issues of sex trafficking in various parts of the world.

240
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:40,280
 And when we saw this, we were quite astonished because the understanding of what is involved

241
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,800
 in sex trafficking was not generally understood at that time.

242
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:54,000
 We soon began to realize just the trauma and the grooming that went on and just the difficulty

243
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,720
 that girls had who were brought into and forced to provide services in that area.

244
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,920
 And so after we had watched this, we began to ask the question, "What is happening in

245
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
 Hong Kong?

246
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:17,360
 How is this related to what's going on in Hong Kong?"

247
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:27,040
 We formed a small movement within the church, I guess it was, of people who were interested

248
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:37,440
 in trying to work with people who had been subject to trafficking or to exploitation.

249
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:46,200
 And as a result of that, an organization called Stop Trafficking of People was formed and

250
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:56,880
 eventually came under the direction and heading of Branches of Hope.

251
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,160
 Branches of Hope is the Vine community's investment to the city of Hong Kong.

252
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:11,600
 It is basically our witness to the truth and the vitality of the gospel.

253
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,840
 And so it is important in that sense that we provide something which is a visible evidence

254
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,640
 of what we believe.

255
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:29,960
 Well I ask the congregation to listen carefully to the work and the experience of Branches

256
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,280
 of Hope today.

257
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,920
 And as you consider this, to ask the Holy Spirit to guide you and to give generously

258
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:47,440
 so that this work can continue and that Branches of Hope get the support and the assistance

259
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,680
 that they need to do the work which is vital to us.

260
00:18:50,680 --> 00:19:10,400
 You know, I love just hearing the story of how Branches of Hope got started.

261
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
 And it's amazing, right?

262
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,640
 It starts small and then as we pay attention to one individual and then learn about what's

263
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,120
 going on, you know, then we can open our heart to God and what God wants to do.

264
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,720
 But right now I'm super excited to welcome Alex up.

265
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,800
 Let's give him a warm welcome.

266
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,360
 He is the executive director of Branches of Hope.

267
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,960
 He also brought a team, so I also want to say hi to the team.

268
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
 Hi team.

269
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
 Yes.

270
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,440
 Thank you so much for being here today and also all the volunteers who volunteer with

271
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,800
 Branches of Hope as well.

272
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,000
 So I have a question for you, Alex.

273
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Where are you from?

274
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,880
 Oh, that's a trick question, isn't it?

275
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,800
 I am also from Germany as it happens.

276
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,720
 So I guess we can just do this in German now, right?

277
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
 Yeah.

278
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
 Everybody's cool with that?

279
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
 Yeah.

280
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
 Okay.

281
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
 Yeah.

282
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,880
 No, so I, yeah, I'm always excited to, you know, see Alex and chat a little German, but

283
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,320
 we'd love to hear if you can tell us a little bit about Branches of Hope, your involvement

284
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,560
 with it, you know, what you're doing there, what brought you here today?

285
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,760
 Yeah, thank you.

286
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,640
 So well, long story short, what brought me here, but here being Hong Kong, is my lovely

287
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,720
 wife Jennifer.

288
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:38,680
 She's been in Hong Kong for almost 18 years and she went on a sabbatical in 2014 and well,

289
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,320
 she basically brought me back.

290
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,360
 So that's how I ended up here.

291
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,040
 I have a career with international humanitarian agencies, the Red Cross, Caritas and so on

292
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
 and so forth.

293
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,080
 So when Jennifer said, well, you know, put her foot down and said, you know, family,

294
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,880
 marital life, you're coming to Hong Kong, I said, okay.

295
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,040
 And it was actually quite a natural fit to be blessed with the opportunity of joining

296
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,880
 Branches of Hope.

297
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,040
 My wife has been coming to the Vine Church for a long time, so we were already aware

298
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,560
 of the great work that the church does and obviously by extension Branches of Hope.

299
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,880
 And when this opportunity came up, I obviously jumped at the chance.

300
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
 Yeah, awesome.

301
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,280
 Well, we have a lot of people here who are not that familiar with Branches of Hope.

302
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,440
 So maybe you can tell us about Branches of Hope in a nutshell, give us just a little

303
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,880
 bit of an overview of what you guys do.

304
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
 Yeah, sure.

305
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
 I'd love to.

306
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:35,320
 I mean, just to expand on what Tony had mentioned in the video, really in a nutshell, Branches

307
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,000
 of Hope was established to be the justice expression of the Vine Church.

308
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,120
 It was basically taking what had been established as a ministry and supercharging it with the

309
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,080
 possibilities of a nonprofit organization.

310
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,240
 So we have two programs.

311
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,160
 We have the Refugee Opportunity and Development Program, which serves, as the name suggests,

312
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,840
 refugees and asylum seekers.

313
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,880
 And then we also have the Stop Trafficking of People Program or STOP, which serves those

314
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,680
 who are experiencing situations of trafficking or also labor exploitation.

315
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,800
 Although these are two very different communities, we have a unified approach the way that we

316
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,140
 do our work, which we call the three pillars of service.

317
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,160
 Those three pillars are care, empowerment, and social change.

318
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,480
 I think care is quite self-explanatory, but I'll get to that in a minute.

319
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,600
 But really, for us, the core is empowerment.

320
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,800
 We believe in the self-agency of the people that we work with.

321
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,320
 It's very important for us to make sure that, as our motto suggests, we restore dignity,

322
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
 justice, and hope.

323
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,880
 So giving people that dignity and making sure that they can be seen as a whole person and

324
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,640
 have the ability to do things independently is very, very close to our heart.

325
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
 We do that in a number of different ways.

326
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,960
 But we also realize that a lot of the marginalized group that we do serve, if you're not coming

327
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,120
 alongside of them to address their material needs, it's very difficult for them to be

328
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,800
 in a place where they can even consider empowerment and personal development.

329
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,680
 And so that's where care comes in.

330
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:15,160
 And then last but not least, if we aren't really telling their story, not just seeking

331
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,040
 them out, but ultimately letting others know of the issues that they're facing, which we

332
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,400
 do through social change, again, we would not be doing them full justice.

333
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,600
 So that's kind of what we do.

334
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,480
 Our mission is to restore dignity, justice, and hope, so that's where the motto comes

335
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,000
 from.

336
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,360
 And our vision is that all vulnerable and marginalized individuals and communities in

337
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,920
 Hong Kong will have equal access to resources and opportunities that allow them to realize

338
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,160
 their dreams and give them a voice in society.

339
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,760
 So in the origin story, you heard that the Vine and at BOH, that there was a relationship.

340
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,960
 Maybe you can tell us a little about that relationship, what that looks like now.

341
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,640
 Yeah, I mean, we're still very, very closely aligned in many respects.

342
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,280
 I mean, just physically, essentially, right?

343
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,360
 I mean, we share office space with the Vine in Wan Chai and are very, very fortunate to

344
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,480
 do that.

345
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,320
 But even though we're an independent organization, we share the same Christian faith, so ultimately

346
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,160
 we have the same values, we're built on the same DNA, you can say.

347
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,400
 And there's formal and informal ways that that actually is strengthened.

348
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,960
 Normally, we have our own board of directors, but actually half of the directors on our

349
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,600
 board are current or former elders of the Vine Church.

350
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,160
 So we make sure that in terms of our vision, in terms of our direction, we're very, very

351
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,520
 closely aligned.

352
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:46,600
 But beyond that, we're extraordinarily fortunate that the Vine continues also to tie to us,

353
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,520
 which is a major advantage for us compared to other organizations.

354
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,480
 It's some of the things that allows us to be as generous as we are in the services that

355
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
 we provide.

356
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,720
 I'll talk a little bit about our STAR program, for example.

357
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,280
 That's a financial assistance program that's 100% in and 100% out.

358
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,520
 We don't take a cut from that because we have the support from the Vine Church, right?

359
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
 That's really important.

360
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,760
 And then, of course, the congregation.

361
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:15,640
 I mean, the biggest source of support in terms of private donors or volunteers or other people

362
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,180
 who come and serve alongside us is the congregation.

363
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,360
 So those are all the different levels that we're so closely aligned.

364
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,920
 Thank you for sharing us more about that relationship.

365
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:33,720
 We're also excited for Branches of Hope to get more involved here in Yinhlong.

366
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,420
 And so there's been conversations around that.

367
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,500
 I think later on, we're going to hear a little bit about it as well.

368
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,220
 But right now, you mentioned ROAD and STOP.

369
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,360
 Could you tell us a little bit more about what they are so we can understand?

370
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
 Yeah.

371
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,480
 So I think just starting with ROAD, then.

372
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:00,760
 So through the ROAD program, we've served several hundred refugees and asylum seekers.

373
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,960
 In fact, we have over 1,400 registered with us in the system.

374
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,120
 That represents almost 10% of the overall refugee and asylum-seeking population here

375
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
 in Hong Kong.

376
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,160
 Maybe you're asking yourself, what is a refugee, right?

377
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,480
 So refugees are people who have fled for one reason or another.

378
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,000
 Could be persecution, could be war, could be other reasons.

379
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,140
 They're a home country and are seeking protection in a third country, right?

380
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,120
 So that's what brings people to Hong Kong.

381
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,840
 The thing about Hong Kong, though, is it's really important to understand is that if

382
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,880
 somebody comes to Hong Kong to become an asylum seeker, to become a refugee, they cannot stay

383
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
 in Hong Kong.

384
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,160
 Hong Kong is not a signatory to the refugee conventions, which means that even if they

385
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,920
 become recognized, that their claim is legitimate, that they are recognized as a refugee, eventually

386
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,000
 they will need to be resettled to a third country.

387
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,560
 There's no integration in Hong Kong, right?

388
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,440
 Unfortunately, though, the reality is that the vast majority, over 99%, in fact, are

389
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,440
 not recognized as refugees and will eventually be returned to their country of origin.

390
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,560
 And that can be a very painful experience because by that time they might have been

391
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,640
 in Hong Kong for 10, 15, 20 years even.

392
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,480
 Their kids might have been going to school here, et cetera.

393
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,480
 And in that time also, they're not allowed to work.

394
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,880
 They get some modest stipends from the government, but they're not enough.

395
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,200
 And so that's really where the road steps in, right?

396
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,240
 The road program steps in to bridge those gaps, to make sure that people have the resources

397
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,760
 that they need to live a dignified life while they're here in Hong Kong.

398
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,880
 We work with them to prepare them for the life after Hong Kong.

399
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,640
 So we've been really working on something what we call durable solutions.

400
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,200
 So this is the idea of helping people, either if they wanted to repatriate themselves to

401
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,840
 their home country or if they want to figure out ways of moving to a third country, we

402
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,920
 assist with those.

403
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:07,200
 We have casework, so helping people find referrals to hospitals, find referrals to other services,

404
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,280
 material donations, food.

405
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,280
 We help with figuring out shelter options, all of those things.

406
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,560
 So that's the care side.

407
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:22,120
 Under empowerment, we also do some limited adult education, which is actually where Yunlong

408
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
 comes into play.

409
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,960
 So we've got Jill over there.

410
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
 Hi, Jill.

411
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
 She's phenomenal.

412
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,840
 She's actually set up a training program here with some of the community members to teach

413
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,880
 them how to sustain themselves on $40 a day, which is all they have for food.

414
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:44,060
 So you can imagine it's quite challenging to purchase food and cook food on such a budget.

415
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,760
 So those are the things that we do.

416
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,820
 And last but not least, like I said, everything gears towards making sure that when that final

417
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,600
 step comes in Hong Kong, that they're ready for it.

418
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
 Yeah.

419
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,720
 You know, like as we talked about earlier, this is really a great opportunity to learn

420
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,560
 about issues that maybe we don't know that much about.

421
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,160
 So thank you so much for sharing that with us.

422
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,800
 Now there is also the STOP program.

423
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,960
 Can you tell us a little bit more about what that's about?

424
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,200
 Yeah, of course.

425
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,960
 So the STOP trafficking of people program is perhaps a little bit more tricky to wrap

426
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
 your head around, right?

427
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,960
 I mean, what is even human trafficking?

428
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,680
 It's a form of modern slavery, and that sounds very scary.

429
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,820
 It is very, very scary.

430
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:36,080
 It involves the recruitment, transportation, or receipt of a person by means of force,

431
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,960
 fraud, or coercion for the purpose of exploitation.

432
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,080
 So this is a very formal explanation.

433
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,640
 And exploitation, I think, is more easily understood.

434
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,480
 It's the unfair treatment of someone to benefit from their work or position of vulnerability.

435
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,360
 Now for STOP, for our understanding, we understand human trafficking to exist on a spectrum,

436
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,320
 on a scale, right?

437
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:06,120
 You may have heard in the past, in other contexts, these sort of sensationalized stories of people

438
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,240
 who are kidnapped and brought across the border and then made to work in some sort of labor

439
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,880
 camp or something like that.

440
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,360
 That does exist, but that's not really what we deal with on a nine to five at STOP.

441
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:25,320
 I mean, what we really focus on is more the lower echelons of that, which starts with

442
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,600
 relatively benign forms of exploitation, right?

443
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:35,440
 So for example, if you have somebody who comes to Hong Kong as a migrant worker, and they

444
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,480
 are given a contract to work as a driver, for example, and then they are told, "Oh,

445
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,680
 but by the way, when you're off duty, you also need to go work in this restaurant,"

446
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,480
 or "You also need to go work in this construction site, and if you refuse, then we will cancel

447
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,160
 your visa, we will cancel your contract."

448
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
 That's a form of coercion, right?

449
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,240
 They're doing something that they didn't come here to do, and whether or not they're paid

450
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,640
 for it is beside the point.

451
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,400
 The fact that they're being threatened in order to do the work, that's where the exploitation

452
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
 starts.

453
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,200
 That's the beginning of that spectrum of human trafficking.

454
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,240
 And it can get worse, right?

455
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,620
 They can then maybe have their passport withheld or other sorts of abuse in that respect.

456
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:22,900
 And so what we do is we step in when that kind of exploitation helps, takes place.

457
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,160
 So we help people to, first of all, understand what their rights are and how they can seek

458
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,120
 help if something like this happens to them.

459
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,680
 And to those who are facing those kind of situations, we make sure that they also have

460
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,680
 the material support that they do.

461
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:43,640
 Oftentimes the help that we provide is the only way that people are even able to access

462
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,880
 justice to begin with.

463
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,640
 You can imagine if somebody's been, let's say for example a migrant domestic worker

464
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,800
 is scammed, their identity is stolen or they've been duped into doing some illegal act, their

465
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,840
 employer cancels their contract, and then they've got two weeks technically to find

466
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,720
 new work.

467
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,200
 If you don't have support in that moment, there's no way that you can address those

468
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
 claims against you.

469
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,000
 There's no way that you can access justice.

470
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,760
 So we make sure that we work together with people to make sure that they know how to

471
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,800
 do that and that they have the resources to do that.

472
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,480
 And last but not least, I'm also quite proud, the STOP team have really established themselves

473
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,120
 as a source of information and technical know-how.

474
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,520
 So they do a lot of research actually that informs the work of other organizations that

475
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,680
 work in the same sector.

476
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,880
 Best practices and policies and things like that.

477
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,200
 So that's kind of what we do with STOP.

478
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,000
 Yeah, so that's amazing work.

479
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,760
 But I think it's also a lot for us to take in, right?

480
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,800
 Learning about road, learning about STOP, justice issues that are happening here in

481
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,960
 Hong Kong.

482
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,720
 So to make it a little bit more tangible, Branches of Hope has prepared a couple of

483
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
 videos for us.

484
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,240
 One is from Ali, who's part of the ROAD program, and then there's also Anna, who's part of

485
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
 the STOP program.

486
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:17,240
 So let's watch that and then let's get back together after that.

487
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,280
 My name is Ali.

488
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,000
 I am from Yemen.

489
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,600
 When I come Hong Kong, I need help for asylum seeker, for some homes.

490
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,400
 How can we live here?

491
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:40,400
 Difficult government now give enough for rent, for food, everything.

492
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
 Not enough.

493
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
 This problem.

494
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,360
 And the asylum seeker cannot work.

495
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,280
 If I go work, maybe I go jail, catch me police or migration.

496
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,120
 This is problem.

497
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,800
 And I worry for my family.

498
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,680
 I have three baby here.

499
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,520
 Yeah, because this big problem.

500
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,120
 Some friend, he tell me, you can go buy insurance.

501
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,320
 After I go, after.

502
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,640
 Help me.

503
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:15,280
 I give extra money for rent, for something, for school.

504
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,640
 Yeah, have class English because we boring in Hong Kong, no work, no.

505
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:29,560
 I am happy because help me.

506
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,520
 Divine help for some money every month.

507
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:48,200
 We find.

508
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,760
 My name is Anna.

509
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,840
 I'm from the Philippines.

510
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,360
 I came to Hong Kong.

511
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,480
 My first time is 2019.

512
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,040
 I work with my employer for four years and three months.

513
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,920
 I came here through my sister-in-law.

514
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,000
 She helped me to come here.

515
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,640
 I have been involved with criminal exploitation.

516
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,080
 The police came in my employer's house and then arrest me.

517
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:29,040
 Some people, these people, I don't know, they use my name to use it in illegal, criminal

518
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,040
 what is.

519
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,320
 That's why I'm involved with this case.

520
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,600
 Yeah, I lose my job.

521
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:48,200
 I'm so grateful and blessed because I found my where to live because I don't have job.

522
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,600
 I cannot afford to stay in the boarding house.

523
00:35:53,600 --> 00:36:00,280
 And then after that, my co-shelter introduced me about stock.

524
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:07,600
 I go to the office and then ask for help.

525
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,000
 The basic necessities, they help us.

526
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 They help me.

527
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,360
 And then I also share with my, I can also share some with my co-shelter.

528
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,600
 Not only financial, also emotional.

529
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,560
 They are very, very kind.

530
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,800
 They help me a lot.

531
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,040
 That's why I'm in good now.

532
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:48,960
 I always thank God because even though I face this struggle, I'm about to face it because

533
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,360
 the people surround me, especially stock.

534
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,800
 I feel, I feel not alone.

535
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,400
 We can always rely on them.

536
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:27,960
 Yeah, it's sobering to learn about those hardships and challenges they face.

537
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:35,400
 Even as somebody who doesn't speak Cantonese and just thinking, how do you even get help

538
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
 and support?

539
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,840
 So thank you so much for the work that you guys do.

540
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,440
 Maybe you can tell us how can we partner with you?

541
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,000
 How can we support the work that you're doing?

542
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Yeah, I'd love to.

543
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,240
 Actually, one of the things I'd like to point out just before I get to that is, I wonder

544
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:58,600
 if you notice that Ali in his sharing, he actually refers to the Vine Church, right?

545
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,640
 And I think this kind of goes back to the point I was making at the beginning.

546
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:08,960
 A lot of the community members that we serve, they also come to the Vines Fellowship.

547
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,480
 We have a refugee fellowship called Arise on Wednesdays.

548
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,240
 And so we have a lot of crossover between those who are coming for fellowship and those

549
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,560
 who that we are helping with the services through Branches of Hope.

550
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,920
 And for them, there's no difference, right?

551
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,760
 It's the same organization.

552
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,480
 It's the Vine Church that's helping.

553
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,800
 And I think it just shows how closely aligned we actually are on those fronts, right?

554
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,640
 But yeah, in terms of how we can work together, honestly, I'd like to highlight four things.

555
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,240
 Prayer is the first.

556
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,800
 Faith in action is the second.

557
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,760
 Being our advocate is the third.

558
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,800
 And fourth is financial support in general.

559
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,960
 Now with prayer, what I'd like to kind of come back to is, again, this idea of the origins

560
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,280
 of Branches of Hope and our identity as a Christian organization, right?

561
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:10,680
 You know, in Luke chapter 18, verse 2 to 8, Jesus tells his disciples a parable of the

562
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,800
 ungodly judge to make them understand that they should always pray and not give up.

563
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,520
 And in Mark chapter 11, verse 24, it says, "Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in

564
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,680
 prayer, believe that you received it and it will be yours."

565
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,120
 This is fundamental to what we do.

566
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,260
 We understand that without God, without the Holy Spirit moving among people, supporting

567
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,960
 what we do, providing the resources that we need, there is no moving forward.

568
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,880
 And so we always ask for people to pray on our behalf, to pray for the communities that

569
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,200
 we serve, to pray that the resources that we need come through.

570
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,280
 But of course, faith in action is an important one.

571
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,440
 I think James has a lot to say about faith in action as well, but fundamentally, there's

572
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,960
 lots of opportunities for people to come and volunteer at Branches of Hope as well.

573
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,400
 In fact, we've got a football tournament coming up.

574
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,240
 I'm very sad not to see you play, Tim.

575
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,240
 We're in the tournament, right?

576
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
 I am playing.

577
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
 You are playing?

578
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,240
 I am playing, yeah.

579
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
 Oh, okay.

580
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
 I take that back.

581
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
 I might not be good, but I am playing.

582
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,240
 We'll just make sure that you stand in front of the goals.

583
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,360
 I'll just lay in front of the goal and block it.

584
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,040
 But yeah, look, I mean, if you want to do something fun on the 11th of October, please

585
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,240
 come sign up as a volunteer.

586
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,120
 We've got plenty of things that you can do.

587
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,320
 In general, when we have events, we love having volunteers work with us, but also for other

588
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
 things.

589
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,040
 I mean, Jill, again, is a fantastic example of what you can do if you want to serve the

590
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
 community.

591
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,040
 Come talk to us.

592
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,640
 We're very happy to support initiatives of this kind.

593
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,320
 So yeah, faith in action, right?

594
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,600
 Then being our advocate.

595
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,520
 Today is a really great example of taking a moment, and we're really very, very grateful

596
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,480
 for this opportunity also to speak here, but taking a moment to understand what issues

597
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,320
 are out there, seeking out, again, what the issues are.

598
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,800
 Because if you know, then you can tell others about it as well.

599
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,120
 You can follow us on social media.

600
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,320
 You can share our social media stuff.

601
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
 Sign up for the newsletter.

602
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,760
 Continue to educate yourself about what's going on and tell others about it.

603
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,440
 If you work for a company, if you work at a school, invite us to come and talk to students,

604
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
 to colleagues.

605
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,340
 We love doing that kind of stuff as well, just to be able to get more people to know

606
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,480
 about what's going on.

607
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,480
 And then of course, financial support.

608
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,920
 I mean, obviously, we cannot keep going.

609
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,280
 We cannot keep doing what we do.

610
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:38,280
 We cannot keep the lights on without the support of individuals like yourselves to make sure

611
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,400
 that we can keep doing what we do.

612
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:47,200
 We're actually just in the process of launching a new financial assistance program in 2025

613
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,360
 called the STAR program.

614
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,300
 This is essentially superseding a previous program.

615
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,960
 Some of you may even know Secret Angel program, if you're familiar with that.

616
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,720
 But basically, we provide monthly allowances to the community members.

617
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,120
 And this is what I meant before, right?

618
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,880
 It's 100% in and out.

619
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,400
 So you can sign up for that.

620
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,120
 There's other ways that you can also support our programs, whether it's making a monthly

621
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,920
 donation or a one-off donation.

622
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,360
 So there's all of that kind of stuff as well.

623
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,440
 And please do come say hello to my wonderful colleagues over there afterwards.

624
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,840
 We've also got some very cool merch.

625
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,320
 I mean, if anybody likes the socks.

626
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
 Yeah.

627
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
 Nice.

628
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,760
 So yeah, please do come and check it out.

629
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,320
 I just bought them before and put them on.

630
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,480
 But I hope it's all going to be good because I didn't wash them.

631
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,300
 I like them.

632
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,360
 So we heard basically four things that we can do, right?

633
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,080
 We can pray.

634
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,280
 And as we've been sharing, prayer really opens us up to the work of the Holy Spirit and God

635
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280
 works through prayers.

636
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,780
 So we can pray for branches of hope.

637
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,640
 We can put our faith in action.

638
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:05,560
 We can volunteer and seek out opportunities to serve with branches of hope.

639
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:10,200
 We also can support the STAR program or donate.

640
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,680
 And I feel like I'm forgetting one.

641
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,680
 Those are all four.

642
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,320
 Prayer, faith in action, education.

643
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,320
 Education advocating.

644
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
 That was it.

645
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:25,160
 And it's interesting with that because when I've brought up talking about human trafficking

646
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,800
 to others in Hong Kong, a lot of times there's a response, "No, there is no such thing here."

647
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,160
 And so there really is a chance to advocate and to educate as well.

648
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,200
 That's super powerful.

649
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,000
 So is there anything else that you would like to share with us?

650
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 Yeah.

651
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,800
 I guess, like you said, we've covered a lot of ground today.

652
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,440
 I'd like to come back again to sort of like the fundamentals a little bit, right?

653
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,400
 And to talk a little bit about our motto, dignity, justice, hope.

654
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,720
 And how those relate specifically to the three pillars of service that I mentioned, right?

655
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,080
 So we've got care, empowerment, and social change.

656
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,120
 Care restores hope.

657
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,880
 When we care for somebody, we give them hope.

658
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,720
 Hope is when we have friends around us.

659
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,040
 Empowerment restores dignity.

660
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,640
 When people are empowered, they are encouraged to be self-sufficient.

661
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,120
 Again, this self-agency of the people that we serve.

662
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,720
 And that restores their dignity.

663
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,900
 It allows them to care for themselves instead of depending on a handout.

664
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:32,400
 And the restoration of dignity comes when we work together and support each other.

665
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,060
 And then last but not least, social change restores justice.

666
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:42,200
 When our society is reformed to protect the marginalized, we actually restore justice.

667
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,400
 And this is kind of what you were saying in your message earlier as well, right?

668
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,720
 Like we, as Christians, we're called to seek it out, right?

669
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,480
 We're supposed to make this world a better place, right?

670
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,200
 And so social change is what restores justice.

671
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,080
 And I think, you know, apart from us being very grateful for being here, it's also an

672
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:05,640
 invitation to all of you to be part of that process so that we can together restore dignity,

673
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,000
 justice, and hope.

674
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 I love this.

675
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,160
 Thank you so much, Alex, for being here.

676
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,160
 Let's give Alex some thanks.

677
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,160
 [APPLAUSE]

678
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,640
 Thanks.

679
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,720
 I would love to actually invite you all to stand.

680
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,640
 And I also want to invite the worship team to come up.

681
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,320
 And we heard today, you know, these ways that we can respond to what has been shared.

682
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:37,720
 We actually took some time to learn about injustices that are happening in our city

683
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:45,200
 and how we can just love and support and make other people's challenges our challenges,

684
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,460
 other people's issues our issue, right?

685
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,640
 And I would love for every one of us to think of one thing, you know, one of these four

686
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,560
 things that they shared that we can do, right?

687
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,340
 Because our faith is about action.

688
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,480
 If you want to pray, pray.

689
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:04,120
 If you want to advocate and share about how you can help, do that.

690
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,840
 If you want to put faith and action through serving, you know, do that.

691
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,640
 And if you want to give financially, support them in their work to do, let's do that.

692
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,760
 Let me pray for us.

693
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:22,280
 Jesus, we thank you that, yeah, you came and you died and rose so that we can be different

694
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:30,480
 people, that we can be people who love you but also love our neighbors and who care about

695
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,720
 those who are suffering, those who are experiencing injustices and that you have sent us out to

696
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:43,180
 heal and advocate and to speak up for and to provide and to care for those in need.

697
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,600
 But we also know that it's you moving through your spirit.

698
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,400
 So Holy Spirit, I just pray that you will move in our church, that you help us to be

699
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,440
 a church that does justice here in the city, that seeks it out and learns to do right.

700
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,580
 And will you guide us in that?

701
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,040
 So I pray all this in your name, Jesus.

702
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,540
 Amen.

703
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:12,540
