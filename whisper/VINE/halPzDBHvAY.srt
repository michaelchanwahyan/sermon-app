1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 God, and in Jesus' name we pray.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,600
 Amen.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,420
 >> Amen, thank you Jess.

4
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,120
 I think once a year I kick a football around,

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,800
 so considering that it was a really good day actually.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,580
 No injuries, it was really fun.

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,400
 Well, you know, a lot of times people ask you,

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,040
 how did you first become a pastor?

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,360
 When did you start your journey?

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,960
 And so let me tell you a little bit about that.

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,200
 I started my journey into full-time ministry

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,720
 as a youth pastor.

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,000
 And back then I was serving the church I grew up in

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,080
 over in Kowloon Tong.

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,840
 I see Paco right there actually.

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,080
 You was in my youth group.

17
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,200
 Okay, well I'm talking about you, okay Paco.

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,320
 Anyway, so I was the youth pastor for a little while.

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,440
 And youth work is a great way to get to know

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,920
 how to do ministry.

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,440
 And one of the things I got to do was to take

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,320
 youth groups on mission trips.

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,960
 And so this was about 17 years ago.

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,660
 I was just a kid back then.

25
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,680
 So I was like a big kid taking some little kids

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,580
 to a foreign country, a place I didn't know the language,

27
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,960
 I didn't know the people to serve a group.

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,240
 I didn't even really know who I was connecting with.

29
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,480
 It's amazing that the parents allowed this all to happen

30
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,520
 in the first place, right?

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
 But it was a really good trip actually overall.

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,400
 But on the first night when we got there,

33
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,760
 we were looking for a place to have dinner.

34
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,240
 Okay, actually we were in Hainan Island.

35
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,520
 This is when I discovered that Hainanese chicken rice

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,920
 is not really from Hainan Island, okay.

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,320
 Amongst many other things.

38
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,960
 So we were looking for a place to have dinner.

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,560
 I was walking around with me and a bunch of about

40
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,920
 12 other kids, teenagers, preteens.

41
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,380
 And so we found this place, right.

42
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,120
 It was a cheap hot pot place.

43
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,020
 So I thought, perfect, you know.

44
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,760
 Hong Kong kids, cheap hot pot, perfect place for dinner.

45
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,240
 Right, and so we decided to have dinner there.

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,860
 And when we walked in, we discovered actually

47
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,500
 it's a all you can eat place.

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,640
 So yeah, right, we love that, right.

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,520
 But how it worked was you get one visit to the buffet table,

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,840
 you get as much food as you want,

51
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,560
 and you can bring it back to the table,

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,800
 and that was your dinner.

53
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,120
 Okay, so we were all there having good time

54
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,120
 and eating away, and there was one kid though

55
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,920
 who got way too much food.

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,240
 Like it was just like a ridiculous amount of food.

57
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,160
 Do you remember back in the day,

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
 or back when I was growing up, Pizza Hut, right,

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,320
 had the salad bar, right.

60
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,680
 Oh, Pizza Hut salad bar, right.

61
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,960
 Me going out for Pizza Hut was like, yes, you know,

62
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,720
 Saitan, you know, white people food, right.

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,880
 This is amazing, okay.

64
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,780
 But that salad bar, right, you got that really flimsy,

65
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,760
 brown, like bamboo-ish sort of bowl, do you remember that?

66
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,280
 Right, and there was whole art to like

67
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,880
 building up the salad, right.

68
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,800
 So you put like the potatoes at the bottom

69
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,360
 to get like a foundation, right.

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
 Stick some cucumbers on the side

71
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,920
 so you could like widen the bowl a little bit, right.

72
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,120
 And people would come back,

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,180
 and it was like this huge tower of salad, right.

74
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,120
 But in the end, like, it just got wasted

75
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,040
 'cause it was disgusting.

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,320
 It was like Thousand Island sauce

77
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,280
 over like pineapples and raisins,

78
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,200
 and like all this random stuff mashed together.

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
 It was disgusting.

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,760
 No one actually liked the salad,

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,600
 and I think they just like seeing how tall

82
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,000
 they could make that tower, right,

83
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,760
 and bringing it back to the table.

84
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,140
 Well, that's kind of what happened, right.

85
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,940
 This kid got all this food, right.

86
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,100
 There was so much, so much food that he got.

87
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,020
 He couldn't finish it all.

88
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,200
 And so I got really upset.

89
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
 I was like, what are we gonna do, right?

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,280
 You've wasted all this food.

91
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,520
 But then I also thought to myself,

92
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,440
 okay, there's a teachable moment here, all right.

93
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,400
 How am I gonna make this into a life lesson, right?

94
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
 So it's a true story.

95
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
 This is what I did.

96
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
 I told the young guy, he's like,

97
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,600
 dude, like what happened?

98
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,840
 You just wasted all this food.

99
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,880
 And he said to me, yeah, I thought

100
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,320
 it was all you can eat, Allison.

101
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,680
 So well, yeah, all you can eat

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
 doesn't mean all you can waste, okay.

103
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
 So like, what are we gonna do about this?

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
 You know, you didn't eat the food.

105
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,240
 You're gonna have to pay for it now.

106
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,480
 And he starts to panic.

107
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,220
 He's like, well, I didn't do anything wrong, right.

108
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,280
 You said it was all you can eat.

109
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,520
 I'm just gonna put the food back.

110
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,240
 He's like, dude, that's disgusting, okay.

111
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,140
 Do not put the food back, okay.

112
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,960
 It's at the table now, all right.

113
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,360
 Something's gotta happen.

114
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
 And he said, what's gonna happen?

115
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,240
 So I told him, okay, well, the manager's gonna come.

116
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,140
 He's gonna weigh all the food.

117
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,540
 And according to how much it weighs,

118
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,240
 you're gonna have to pay the penalty

119
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,560
 for wasting all this food.

120
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,060
 And then he really starts to panic.

121
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,960
 So how much money are you gonna have to pay?

122
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,000
 Like, my mom didn't give me that much pocket money.

123
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
 You know, I've been planning to spend on some souvenirs.

124
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
 Like, I don't have it.

125
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,840
 Like, what am I gonna do?

126
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,020
 So I told him, okay, the only way you can get out of this

127
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,760
 is if you go to the manager

128
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,280
 and you beg him for forgiveness, okay.

129
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,640
 Beg him for forgiveness.

130
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,960
 Maybe he'll just let you go.

131
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
 He's panicking, okay, where is he?

132
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,160
 So I point to a gentleman

133
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,560
 sitting on the other side of the restaurant, okay.

134
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,320
 That's the manager sitting right there, right.

135
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,040
 Now, I've just pointed to a random guy

136
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,440
 minding his business, okay.

137
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,660
 He's there having dinner with his family, right.

138
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,360
 Because the truth was, there was no manager, okay.

139
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,640
 It was mad at him.

140
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,540
 I, just like I said, teachable moment.

141
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,740
 I wanted to teach him a lesson to not to waste food.

142
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,360
 Right, so this boy, he stands there for a minute, right.

143
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,600
 And he's like sweating bullets.

144
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,680
 He's like rehearsing what he's gonna say.

145
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,800
 You know, practicing his Mandarin.

146
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,680
 He's like, (mimics Mandarin)

147
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,360
 Right, and so, and then he really like, you know,

148
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,080
 coyly walks up to this man, taps him on the shoulder,

149
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,280
 and he just starts going for it.

150
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,580
 I'm really sorry, I've ate all this food, you know.

151
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,840
 I don't have money to pay, please forgive me, right.

152
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,200
 And this man's just staring blankly at him like,

153
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,040
 why is this kid like confessing

154
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,240
 all his sins to me right now, you know.

155
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,200
 And then anyway, I was standing in the corner

156
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,400
 also crying, but with laughter, right.

157
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,340
 Like, I'm not saying it was a good thing or a bad thing,

158
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,220
 I don't know, but no more food was wasted that trip.

159
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,300
 We'll say it like that, okay.

160
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,300
 So, now of course, you know, that's a bit of a funny story.

161
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,900
 But in a way, we sort of, we've all been there, right,

162
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,700
 in that moment.

163
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,140
 Like that moment when we realize we've done something wrong

164
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,220
 and the guilt and the shame and the fear

165
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,880
 that comes with that.

166
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,980
 And then you have this reaction

167
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,420
 of trying to make things right.

168
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,140
 Realizing then, actually, there is nothing I can do

169
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,980
 to make it right.

170
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,900
 The only thing left for me to do is to ask for forgiveness

171
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,220
 and hope that forgiveness is offered to us.

172
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,400
 You know, we're at the tail end of the year already,

173
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,720
 believe it or not.

174
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,560
 And we have Advent starting soon.

175
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,520
 But before Advent, this is our last sermon series

176
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,760
 of the year.

177
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,640
 And actually, this sermon series was born

178
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,720
 out of a heart cry of the community, I believe.

179
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,840
 And you may remember a few months ago,

180
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,280
 we did an event called Converse.

181
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,240
 And at Converse, we set up prayer stations

182
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,200
 up at a high school, you know, just up the hill.

183
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,240
 And there was a big hall and there was all these different,

184
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,720
 amazing prayer stations, different ways for us

185
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,400
 to interact with prayer.

186
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,440
 And one of the stations was to do with forgiveness, right.

187
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,960
 It was either asking, you know, prayer requests

188
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,760
 to give forgiveness or to receive forgiveness.

189
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,920
 And as we looked through the prayer requests

190
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,480
 that were written out, we realized, right,

191
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,680
 this is a theme that so many of us are struggling with

192
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,820
 in our community.

193
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,680
 Many of these had to do with relationships, right.

194
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,460
 People asking for the strength to be able to forgive people

195
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,120
 that have hurt them in different ways.

196
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,760
 There were also many voices asking for forgiveness

197
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,280
 because they have been the ones who have caused harm

198
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,720
 and hurt to other people.

199
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,560
 A lot of written on there was to, you know,

200
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,640
 about forgiving ourselves, right.

201
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,560
 The different things that we struggle with,

202
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,720
 asking God for forgiveness.

203
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,600
 And in some ways, there was also a lot of requests

204
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,120
 asking for, you know, to be able to forgive God, right.

205
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,320
 Because people have felt like God has let them down.

206
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,880
 They put their faith in God and they felt like God

207
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
 had let them down.

208
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,480
 And I feel like I need to forgive God in some way.

209
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,040
 And so since this was a topic that so many of us

210
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,520
 were wrestling with, we figured it was time

211
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,080
 to address this together as a church.

212
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,880
 Because the truth is, we all need, everyone needs

213
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,800
 to come to a good understanding of what forgiveness is,

214
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,680
 of what forgiveness is and what it's supposed to look like

215
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,800
 because forgiveness sits at the center of God's heart.

216
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,520
 And forgiveness is essential for our relationship with God.

217
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,200
 In fact, without forgiveness, there would be no relationship

218
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,600
 with God possible, right.

219
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,320
 At the same time, forgiveness is also essential

220
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,240
 for us to be in relationship and in community

221
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,280
 with each other.

222
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,200
 Without forgiveness, not even this church, right,

223
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,040
 society itself would totally break down

224
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,800
 and we would never be able to do life

225
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
 and to connect with each other.

226
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,080
 But at the same time, as we've experienced,

227
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,080
 it's not that simple.

228
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,480
 Right, because forgiveness is nuanced

229
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,160
 with so many different questions and feelings and emotions.

230
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,440
 And over these next few weeks, we're gonna face

231
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,120
 some of these questions head on.

232
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,880
 We're gonna be talking about some theological framework

233
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 about what forgiveness is from the biblical perspective.

234
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,400
 We're gonna be looking at some very practical ways

235
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,560
 of how we can forgive, what forgiveness is

236
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,480
 and what forgiveness isn't.

237
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,040
 We're gonna hear testimonies from our community groups

238
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,880
 about how forgiveness has been such an enriching part

239
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,640
 of their relationship with each other.

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,320
 We're gonna talk about what it means

241
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,400
 for us to forgive ourselves.

242
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,960
 And in the end, the hope is we're gonna be equipped

243
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,800
 to be live out, to be walking out,

244
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,320
 to live a life that is defined by forgiveness.

245
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,120
 And so to start us on our journey today,

246
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,840
 I want to look at a passage that teaches us,

247
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,720
 you know, that I think really Jesus uses this passage

248
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,280
 to highlight just how important forgiveness is

249
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,440
 from his perspective and how he hopes

250
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,400
 his followers will respond to it.

251
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,960
 Okay, we're looking at Matthew chapter 18, verses 21 to 35.

252
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,160
 I'm gonna read it and you can follow along.

253
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,160
 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,

254
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,280
 "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister

255
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,880
 "who sins against me?

256
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,440
 "Up to seven times?"

257
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,440
 Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but 77 times.

258
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,160
 "Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king

259
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,920
 "who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.

260
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,780
 "As he began the settlement, a man who owed him

261
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,260
 "10,000 bags of gold was brought to him.

262
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,900
 "Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered

263
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,420
 "that he and his wife and his children

264
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,500
 "and all that he had to be sold to repay the debt."

265
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,680
 Excuse me.

266
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,800
 "At this, the servant fell on his knees before him.

267
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,440
 "Be patient with me, he begged,

268
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,740
 "and I will pay back everything.

269
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,900
 "The servant's master took pity on him,

270
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,600
 "canceled the debt, and let him go.

271
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,780
 "But when that servant went out,

272
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,460
 "he found one of his fellow servants

273
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,140
 "who owed him 100 silver coins.

274
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,480
 "He grabbed him and began to choke him.

275
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,180
 "'Pay back what you owe me,' he demanded.

276
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,740
 "His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him,

277
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,940
 "'Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.'

278
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,200
 "But he refused.

279
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,720
 "Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison

280
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,200
 "until he could pay the debt.

281
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,480
 "When the other servants saw what had happened,

282
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,880
 "they were outraged and went to tell the master

283
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,760
 "everything that had happened.

284
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,980
 "The master then called the servant in.

285
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,520
 "'You wicked servant,' he said.

286
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,300
 "'I canceled all that debt of yours

287
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,760
 "'because you begged me to.

288
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,040
 "'Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant

289
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,560
 "'just as I had on you?'

290
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,660
 "In his anger, the master handed him over to the jailers

291
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,020
 "to be tortured until he should pay back all that he owed.

292
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,540
 "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you

293
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,540
 "unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."

294
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,220
 Challenging words.

295
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,340
 I think one of the reasons why it's challenging

296
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,360
 is because when we talk about forgiveness,

297
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,060
 initially, it's sort of like a counterproductive thing

298
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,960
 to do, we feel like.

299
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,820
 It feels foreign to our natural inclinations.

300
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,900
 It's unnatural.

301
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,140
 Maybe that's just me.

302
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,520
 But when we're hurt, when we're wronged,

303
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,540
 we don't want to forgive.

304
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,100
 What we want is revenge.

305
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,820
 What we want is revenge because we think revenge,

306
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,020
 getting this person back, is gonna make us feel better.

307
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,540
 On a micro level, this happens all the time,

308
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,700
 especially in Hong Kong.

309
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,820
 We Hong Kongers, super good at passive,

310
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,540
 aggressive forms of revenge.

311
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,220
 You go into MTR, someone steps on the back of your shoe.

312
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,580
 So in the end, you find them down in the MTR

313
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,300
 and then you bump them with your bag

314
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,260
 just so you can get them back from stepping on your shoes.

315
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,180
 Yes, feels so good to do that.

316
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,820
 Don't ride the MTR with me.

317
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:22,300
 But what happens, that's just a silly, trivial thing.

318
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,060
 What happens, though, when the stakes are a bit higher?

319
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,020
 What kind of revenge goes through your mind

320
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,840
 when you think about maybe the person

321
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,460
 who's caused you really hurtful wounds?

322
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,080
 They've hurt you in almost a devastating kind of way.

323
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,960
 How do you pay back the friend who stabbed you in the back,

324
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,940
 who betrayed you?

325
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,160
 What about the spouse or the partner that cheats on you?

326
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,060
 The business partner who runs off with all your money?

327
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,120
 A parent who abused you?

328
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,020
 A person who assaulted you?

329
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,820
 A boss or a coworker who humiliates you?

330
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,140
 How do we react in those kind of situations?

331
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,200
 I think revenge is the sort of mentality

332
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,200
 that Peter is bringing here before Jesus.

333
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,620
 When he asked the question, "Lord, how many times

334
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,820
 "shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me?"

335
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,300
 Up to seven times.

336
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,540
 Right, it's such typical Peter behavior in the Bible

337
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,860
 and I love how accurate and how honest the Bible is

338
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,220
 when it comes to the flaws of the disciples.

339
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,260
 So close yet so far.

340
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,740
 He seems to understand, yes, okay,

341
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,620
 maybe forgiveness is kind of necessary,

342
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,220
 but maybe it should also have a limit.

343
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,480
 And so when Peter says up to seven times,

344
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,620
 from his perspective, this is going above and beyond

345
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,860
 what he was supposed to do.

346
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,140
 In Jewish culture, seven is the perfect number.

347
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,340
 So by Peter saying seven, Peter is saying,

348
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,100
 yes, seven, if seven is surely more than enough.

349
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,940
 After I've done, I'm forgiven seven times,

350
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,100
 after I've done God's will, I should be able

351
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,460
 to take the situation into my own hands, right?

352
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,580
 Or maybe you can look at it like this.

353
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,540
 I had an uncle who told me one time that,

354
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,980
 you know what, Ellison, Jesus only says

355
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,260
 you have to turn the cheek one time.

356
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,540
 If you turn the cheek and he hits you again,

357
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,340
 you have permission to slap the snot out of that person.

358
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,780
 [congregation laughing]

359
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,580
 That's not true, by the way.

360
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,180
 But that's sort of like the vibe,

361
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,820
 the energy that Peter is bringing into his question.

362
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,980
 Right, and honestly, if we were honest with ourselves

363
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,580
 or when I'm honest with myself,

364
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,540
 I wish sometimes that's the answer that Jesus gave, right?

365
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,580
 Permission to fight back.

366
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,100
 He would have said something like, yes, you know what,

367
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,300
 seven times, that's more than enough, Peter.

368
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,460
 Right, on the eighth time, you know, throw hands,

369
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,100
 you know, do what you want to do.

370
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,980
 But he doesn't.

371
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,540
 Instead, his response is a deep challenge to his followers

372
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,620
 on how we are supposed to forgive.

373
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,460
 Jesus answered, I tell you not seven times, but 77 times.

374
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,700
 Now again, it's not a formula, right?

375
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,860
 Jesus is not saying on the 78th time,

376
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,220
 you can do something about it yourself.

377
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,740
 What Jesus means here is that there is no limit.

378
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,420
 There is not supposed to be a limit

379
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,540
 to the number of times you should offer forgiveness.

380
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,960
 In other words, if you really want to do God's will,

381
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,220
 don't even think about counting, just forgive.

382
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,140
 Now that, my friends, is a hard pill to swallow

383
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,340
 because it sounds like we're just supposed to be helpless.

384
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,860
 Right, it almost sounds like forgiveness is cheapened,

385
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,220
 right, it sounds as though Jesus is giving permission

386
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,260
 for people just to walk all over us,

387
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,940
 do whatever they want to hurt us,

388
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,980
 and there's not a single thing we can do about it.

389
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,540
 All we have to do is just keep forgiving

390
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,900
 and forgiving and forgiving.

391
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,600
 But what if, and I'm sure many of this people room have

392
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,080
 and many people listening have,

393
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,640
 what if we've been hurt in the most horrible of ways?

394
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,500
 Does God just expect me to let it go and to forget about it?

395
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,980
 Is this what it means to forgive?

396
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,940
 Because if so, it doesn't sound like

397
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,860
 it's very healthy for us, right?

398
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,820
 It doesn't sound healthy for us to live life that way,

399
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,440
 for the community to practice forgiveness that way.

400
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,260
 This is not what Jesus means.

401
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,060
 And so he tries to explain this with a parable a little bit

402
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,500
 to illustrate the point.

403
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,300
 And he says it like this.

404
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,620
 This is the story.

405
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,540
 Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king

406
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,340
 who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.

407
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,620
 As he began the settlement, a man who owed him

408
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,960
 10,000 bags of gold was brought to him.

409
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,620
 Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered

410
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,660
 that he and his wife and his children

411
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,400
 and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.

412
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,600
 Now this is that word debt.

413
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,240
 Debt is such a scary word.

414
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,400
 The word itself almost sounds heavy, right?

415
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,320
 You know what I mean?

416
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,640
 It's a sort of word that can fill with dread

417
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,460
 and panic and anxiety.

418
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,200
 In my context, it's kind of sad.

419
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
 The only letters and phone calls I have these days

420
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,800
 is either people telling them, I owe the money,

421
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,400
 so the credit card bill comes in

422
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,120
 or the electricity bill comes in,

423
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,220
 school fees, taxes, overdue living charges,

424
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,200
 all that kind of stuff, right?

425
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,640
 So it's, I owe you money, you're in debt to me,

426
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,960
 I'll listen in this, right?

427
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,320
 Or it's invitations to get into even more debt, right?

428
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,920
 Say, hi, you know, it's like,

429
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,680
 you know, you're in trauma and typhoon, blah, blah, blah,

430
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,320
 all that kind of stuff, all those phone calls

431
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,440
 that you get, okay?

432
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,280
 Do you need to borrow money?

433
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,120
 Do you speak Chinese?

434
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,940
 Do you speak English?

435
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,580
 Okay, those kind of calls.

436
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,960
 So debt is scary.

437
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,080
 The scary thing about debt is because it carries

438
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,360
 with it consequences.

439
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,200
 When you don't pay back your debt,

440
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,760
 there are consequences to your actions.

441
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,760
 And this is what we see happening

442
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,520
 in this opening scene of this story.

443
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,960
 We're told that this man, right,

444
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,440
 is in an unbelievable amount of debt.

445
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,280
 10,000 bags of gold, right?

446
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,080
 This is a crazy, ridiculous amount of money, right?

447
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,600
 Some of the research I was doing, some of the commentaries,

448
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,580
 this would be the equivalent of billions

449
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,160
 or maybe even like a made up number,

450
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,320
 like gazillions, okay, about of dollars.

451
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,160
 But Jesus was doing this on purpose, right?

452
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,520
 He purposely uses an exaggeration to make a point.

453
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,440
 A massive amount of money, there is no way in heaven

454
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,560
 or on earth that this guy will ever able

455
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,800
 to pay back this amount.

456
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,320
 Not even if he lives a million lifetimes

457
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,600
 would he be able to pay back this amount of money.

458
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,480
 And so it spells out the consequence.

459
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,620
 The consequence would be that he would have to sell himself,

460
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,480
 his wife, and his children, and everything that he owed

461
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,320
 to repay the debt.

462
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,000
 Now, I think in order for us to truly understand

463
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,480
 forgiveness from God's heart, we have to imagine ourselves

464
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,040
 in this situation a little bit.

465
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,220
 Because the truth is, like this man who was caught up

466
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,220
 in debt to the king, to his master, we are also in debt.

467
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,800
 But our debt is owed to the king of kings, to God himself.

468
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,320
 And we are in debt to God because of our sin.

469
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,840
 Every single person is.

470
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,560
 Scripture tells us all have sinned and fallen short

471
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,720
 of the glory of God.

472
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,800
 And scripture also tells us the reality is,

473
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 the wages, the debt, the consequences of sin is death.

474
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,640
 Now, this is an idea we're gonna unpack

475
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,480
 a bit more clarity next week.

476
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,660
 But essentially, it means that every one of us,

477
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,760
 no matter who we are, we have all sinned against God.

478
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,440
 And because we have sinned against God,

479
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,620
 we owe him an insurmountable amount of debt

480
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,480
 that we will never, ever, ever be able to pay back.

481
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,240
 And because of this debt, God indeed has the right

482
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,560
 to demand everything from us, including our lives.

483
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:05,480
 Now, if the story ended here, it would be a bit sad,

484
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,120
 but justifiable, right?

485
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,360
 We owe this, this is the situation without fail,

486
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,260
 every single person is in.

487
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,500
 But the good news, the gospel is that this isn't

488
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,260
 where the story ends, right?

489
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,420
 And so Jesus tries to illustrate this in the way

490
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,500
 the master responds to his servant.

491
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,260
 At this, the servant fell on his knees before him.

492
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,940
 "Be patient with me," he begged,

493
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,500
 "and I will pay everything back."

494
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,580
 The servant's master took pity on him,

495
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,940
 "Cancel the debt and let him go."

496
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,700
 This man realizes, right, his inevitable doom.

497
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,500
 And he tries to do everything in his own power.

498
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,140
 He falls to his knees, he begs for surrender,

499
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,640
 he asks for patience and mercy, he literally begs,

500
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,940
 "I'm gonna pay you back."

501
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,300
 He makes promises that he cannot keep.

502
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,840
 It's almost like a pathetic and hopeless pleading.

503
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,140
 But remember, right, there is no way, this man knows

504
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,700
 there's no way he can pay back the gazillion dollars

505
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,780
 he owes his master.

506
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,740
 And I found that sometimes that's the kind of situation

507
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,200
 we find ourselves in too.

508
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,180
 But when we realize our sin, when we realize

509
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,540
 how much in debt we are to God because of our sin,

510
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,900
 we end up promising God this and that, right?

511
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,180
 "I'm gonna be better, I'm gonna fix myself,

512
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,480
 "I'm gonna try and be better.

513
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,860
 "I'm never gonna do that again,

514
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,300
 "I'm never gonna do this again."

515
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,300
 But what I found in my life is that the more I try,

516
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,180
 even though I try and I try and I try,

517
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,720
 the harder I try, it's almost like the harder we fail.

518
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,540
 And I've slowly come to the realization

519
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,620
 that through our own power, through our own will,

520
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,940
 we will never, ever, ever, ever be able

521
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,540
 to pay back the debt of sin.

522
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:54,140
 And the master realizes this and God realizes this.

523
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,900
 And even though he has the right and authority

524
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,900
 to divine some sort of payment,

525
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,560
 something really beautiful happens.

526
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,380
 This phrase, "The servant's master took pity on him."

527
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,460
 The word pity here means like love actually

528
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,120
 and compassion.

529
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,580
 Not because the servant has done anything

530
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,560
 to deserve a pardon, but because of the master's heart

531
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,380
 of love and compassion, the debt is canceled

532
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,020
 and he is set free.

533
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,300
 And considering the amount of debt he was owed,

534
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,180
 this was unimaginable, right?

535
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,540
 The listeners of Jesus's time listening to this,

536
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,560
 were like, "This guy must be crazy

537
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,460
 "to just let all that money go."

538
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,420
 But this is the master saying,

539
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,620
 "What matters to me is not the amount of money

540
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,720
 "that he owes, I'm trying to demonstrate my heart

541
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,900
 "of grace, of mercy, of compassion, and of love."

542
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,220
 And the servant walks away in freedom.

543
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,100
 And this is Jesus reminding us, right?

544
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,320
 This is an echo of God's message of forgiveness of sin.

545
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,100
 Actually, this is a message that God has said

546
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,660
 time and time and time again.

547
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,620
 We see God's heart to forgive.

548
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,540
 Throughout the Old Testament even, Isaiah 43, 25,

549
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,840
 "I will blot out your transgressions."

550
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,140
 Jeremiah 31, 34, "I will forgive their wickedness

551
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,500
 "and remember their sins no more."

552
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,620
 Psalm 103, 12, one of my favorite passages,

553
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,140
 "As far the east is from the west,

554
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,140
 "so far has he removed our transgressions from us."

555
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,140
 This is our starting point, church.

556
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,600
 Never forget this.

557
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,600
 God's heart is one that is inclined towards forgiveness.

558
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,120
 His heart is one of compassion and of love.

559
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,200
 This is what we were singing over and over

560
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,120
 and over again this morning, right?

561
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,400
 His heart is that despite the fact that we have wronged him,

562
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,920
 we have disappointed him, we have sinned in our lives,

563
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,040
 we have missed the mark, we have gone against his will,

564
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,040
 despite that many times we make a mess of things,

565
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,000
 God still looks on us with love and compassion, amen?

566
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And God loved us so much,

567
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,120
 he gave us his most precious gift, his son,

568
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,160
 as the only way to repay the debt of sin,

569
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,720
 God gave us his son, paying the debt of our sins

570
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,400
 so that we can have relationship with him.

571
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,600
 Again, this is something we're gonna talk more about

572
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,420
 next week and in the weeks to come.

573
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,360
 But what we need to understand for today is this,

574
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,800
 is we who worship the true God are a people

575
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,480
 who have had all their debt forgiven

576
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,360
 because our master loves us.

577
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,920
 Forgiveness, therefore, is important

578
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,640
 because it's the key not just to this life,

579
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,080
 but to eternal life as well.

580
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,760
 This is what I mean when I say forgiveness

581
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,440
 sits at the very heart of God

582
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,800
 and encapsulates all that he came to do,

583
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,640
 was to offer forgiveness for you, for me,

584
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,920
 for anyone who asks of it.

585
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,000
 If you are a follower of Jesus in this room today,

586
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,880
 you are free because you have received God's forgiveness.

587
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,080
 Now, as a people who've understood

588
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,440
 and experienced this wonderful gift of forgiveness,

589
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,760
 you would think that we would now want to share

590
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,720
 this gift with others as well,

591
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,520
 like last week when we were talking about the gospel.

592
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,960
 But again, it's hard and it's complicated.

593
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,280
 It doesn't always work this way.

594
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,760
 And for the servant on this story,

595
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,040
 we find that though, even though he is the one

596
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,440
 who has experienced the forgiveness of a great debt,

597
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,780
 his own heart remains unchanged.

598
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,760
 It tells us this, but when that servant went out,

599
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,580
 he found one of his fellow servants

600
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,800
 who owed him 100 silver coins.

601
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,880
 He grabbed him and began to choke him.

602
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,760
 "Pay back what you owe me," he demanded.

603
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,860
 His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him,

604
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,680
 "Be patient with me and I will pay it back."

605
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,200
 But he refused.

606
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,480
 Instead, he went off and had that man thrown in prison

607
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,160
 until he could pay the debt.

608
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,080
 You see, when this man encounters someone who owes him money,

609
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,480
 his heart is not full of compassion.

610
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,580
 He remains tight-fisted and stingy about what he's owed.

611
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,440
 100 silver coins, okay, I said just now,

612
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,640
 you know that 10,000 bags of gold was like a gazillion

613
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,900
 dollars, 100 silver coins would have been about maybe

614
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,140
 the equivalent of four months' wages,

615
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,560
 the Bible scholars say.

616
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,580
 Not a small sum in and of itself,

617
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,520
 but not insurmountable as well.

618
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,520
 But compared to what he owed, completely insignificant.

619
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,580
 And this dialogue that he has, it's almost an exact replica

620
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,140
 of what just happened with him and his master.

621
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,340
 There's a debt, there's a falling to the knees,

622
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,000
 begging for patience and mercy.

623
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,760
 But like I said, the difference is that there's no mention

624
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,120
 of compassion from this servant's heart.

625
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,420
 Instead, it's the opposite.

626
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,320
 Listen to this term, he said he refused.

627
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,420
 When it says refused, this word means to sort of like

628
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,100
 harden his heart, right?

629
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,760
 He made a conscious decision in his mind,

630
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,680
 I am not willing, I'm going to make a choice

631
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,480
 not to forgive this person.

632
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,540
 And actually, it gets even worse.

633
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,360
 Not only does he refuse, but he tries to take actions

634
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,140
 into his own hands.

635
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,700
 He escalates.

636
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,660
 He purposely, first of all, goes out of his way

637
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,700
 to seek out this person who owes him.

638
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,540
 And when he finds him, it says he physically abuses him.

639
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,460
 He grabs him and he chokes him.

640
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,640
 He takes matters into his own hands.

641
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,140
 As you read this story, you probably, as I was,

642
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,780
 judging this guy right now.

643
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,800
 Well, how evil, how wicked is this man

644
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,340
 that he would do something like this?

645
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,520
 Now, before we get too judgmental of the servant,

646
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,640
 and as uncomfortable as this might make us,

647
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,860
 maybe we need to lean into this part of the story

648
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,220
 a little bit.

649
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,140
 And I found it helpful, instead of judging it

650
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,800
 from the outside, to use this scenario more like a mirror

651
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,700
 to check my own attitude toward forgiveness.

652
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,060
 Maybe it's a bit more like this servant

653
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,100
 than we think it is.

654
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,340
 Because like I said just now, when we've been sinned against

655
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,940
 our first reaction is more likely inclined towards revenge.

656
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:33,140
 We want to see people suffer and get what they deserve

657
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,520
 when they sin against us.

658
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,020
 I admit to you, in my own heart, this is often what I feel.

659
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,380
 I want to be able to enjoy all of God's forgiveness.

660
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,060
 Yes, I want to be able to come to God,

661
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,440
 ask for his forgiveness, and receive his compassion

662
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,420
 and mercy and grace.

663
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,580
 But sometimes when people sin against me,

664
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,140
 my first reaction is not, "Father, forgive them."

665
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,300
 My reaction is, "I hope they suffer.

666
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,120
 "I hope God punished them for what they did to me.

667
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,020
 "In fact, I hope they first, you know,

668
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,040
 "they experience 10 times worse than what they did to me.

669
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,640
 "That's what they deserve."

670
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,240
 I know I'm not alone in this.

671
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,720
 But this is precisely why this whole series

672
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,180
 and this conversation on forgiveness is important

673
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,220
 for us to have together.

674
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,580
 Because now Jesus starts to talk about the consequences,

675
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,860
 about debt, when we don't forgive.

676
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,300
 Jesus seems to be saying, "Unless you learn to forgive

677
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,440
 "that you have been forgiven,

678
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,100
 "there are gonna be consequences.

679
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,460
 "And these consequences affect both the wider community,

680
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,240
 "but also your own relationship with God as well."

681
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,020
 Let me tell you how it leaves a strain

682
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,880
 on the community, first of all.

683
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,980
 When the other servants saw what had happened,

684
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,960
 they were outraged and went and told their master

685
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,460
 everything that has happened, that had happened.

686
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,600
 All right, this is why I said

687
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,680
 this is a heart cry of the church.

688
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,060
 This is why I said we're gonna take this journey together

689
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,040
 as a community, as a body of Christ,

690
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,500
 as a family of brothers and sisters.

691
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,240
 Because often when we talk about forgiveness,

692
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,080
 we tend to look at it individualistically.

693
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,160
 That's just between two people.

694
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,320
 It doesn't concern the rest of the community.

695
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,480
 So let's say me and Derek here had beef.

696
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,240
 We had a problem with each other.

697
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,680
 If people find out, just leave the Eric and,

698
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,600
 Ellison and Derek can figure that out by themselves,

699
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,160
 it doesn't concern us.

700
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,500
 But actually it does.

701
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,660
 I think as a body of Christ, we all need to agree

702
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,600
 that forgiveness is a poison.

703
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,720
 And that if we don't deal with it,

704
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,560
 there is no way we can ever be the body of Christ

705
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,120
 that he has called us to be.

706
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,020
 How are we supposed to walk alongside each other

707
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,880
 if we're not willing to forgive?

708
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,100
 How are we supposed to grow in intimacy

709
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,080
 if we hold grudges against each other?

710
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,820
 How are we gonna encourage each other

711
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,840
 if we keep account of what's right and what's wrong?

712
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,120
 Every time we've wronged and right,

713
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,000
 we keep an account of the rights and wrongs.

714
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,820
 Therefore, as a community, we need to be aware of this.

715
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,980
 And as a community, if we see unforgiveness taking place,

716
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,260
 we need to do something about it

717
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,860
 so it doesn't corrupt the rest of the body of Christ.

718
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,360
 We need to call it out.

719
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,220
 What also points out is the community then,

720
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,300
 it's supposed to be a place of safety

721
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,900
 and of accountability.

722
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,460
 You see, if no one else had got involved,

723
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,140
 the servant would have got away with his actions.

724
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,260
 He would have got away with abusing his debtor,

725
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,840
 having him thrown in jail,

726
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,280
 punished for something like that.

727
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,760
 But notice, it was the other servants

728
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,520
 who called him out of his sin.

729
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,560
 It was the other servants, the community around him

730
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,800
 that flagged to the master,

731
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,480
 hey, something isn't quite right here.

732
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,160
 And we need to do and say something about it.

733
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:01,200
 So when it comes to forgiveness,

734
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,480
 we see forgiveness and justice

735
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,060
 is something that actually go hand in hand with each other.

736
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,620
 Forgiveness doesn't mean that one's causing harm

737
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,080
 can just get away with it.

738
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,980
 But forgiveness is what happens when a community,

739
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,860
 when somebody is wrong and the community around you

740
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,580
 comes around you to support you,

741
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,500
 to give you strength and power to confront the wrong

742
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
 and it's voiced out.

743
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,380
 You see what I'm saying?

744
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,900
 Community, I mean, forgiveness doesn't mean saying

745
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,180
 it really didn't happen, right?

746
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,260
 It really doesn't matter, just let it go, right?

747
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,980
 In either of those cases, if it didn't matter,

748
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,020
 you just let it go, you don't need forgiveness, right?

749
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,380
 Maybe it's just a misunderstanding

750
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,500
 that needs to be cleared up.

751
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,220
 But forgiveness is the process when we admit,

752
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,900
 yes, something did happen.

753
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,660
 It did matter, something has gone wrong

754
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,100
 and we need to deal with it.

755
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,620
 And we deal with it together as a body of Christ.

756
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,100
 But the way we deal with it is to hand it over to God,

757
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,900
 to say we're not God.

758
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,540
 We don't get to set the standard of who is worthy

759
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,580
 of forgiveness or who is not.

760
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,820
 We simply offer forgiveness first

761
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,340
 because without that, we will never be able to move on

762
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,900
 as individuals and as a community.

763
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:23,500
 So that's how it affects us together as a body of Christ.

764
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,500
 On the same time though, it has an individual impact

765
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,460
 on us as well.

766
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,100
 And God spells out very clearly

767
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,540
 the results of withholding forgiveness.

768
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,220
 Then the master called the servant in.

769
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,540
 You wicked servant, he said.

770
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:44,500
 I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.

771
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,200
 Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant

772
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,540
 just as I had on you?

773
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,020
 In his anger, the master handed him over to the jailers

774
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:56,300
 to be tortured until he should pay back all that he owed.

775
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,260
 This is how my heavenly father will treat each of you

776
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,140
 unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.

777
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,640
 Again, this sounds harsh.

778
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,820
 But I think the point Scripture is trying to make is this.

779
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,060
 It might seem like when we don't offer forgiveness

780
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:18,180
 that we hold onto the power, that we hold onto the control.

781
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,100
 But when in reality, what Jesus is saying

782
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,680
 is when we withhold forgiveness,

783
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,440
 it's actually a great detriment to us.

784
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,700
 It seems like the other person

785
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,660
 is getting what they deserve.

786
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,300
 But in reality, what we're doing is condemning ourselves.

787
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,100
 You might know the old saying,

788
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,340
 unforgiveness is like drinking a poison

789
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,300
 and expecting the other person to die.

790
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,980
 Right, so it has really, really serious consequences

791
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,340
 for ourselves if we withhold forgiveness.

792
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,940
 Maybe you could think about it this way.

793
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,820
 All right, we're gonna do a little exercise together.

794
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,120
 Okay, on the count of three,

795
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,340
 I want everybody to take a deep breath.

796
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,820
 When you take a deep breath,

797
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,260
 hold it in for as long as you can.

798
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,340
 Try and hold your breath.

799
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,100
 One, two, three.

800
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:25,780
 Some of us might be able to do this for longer.

801
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,280
 But you're probably feeling a struggle to breathe now,

802
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,680
 right, to breathe out that breath.

803
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,880
 Right, none of us, nobody in this room

804
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,320
 is able to hold their breath forever.

805
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,360
 You would either pass out,

806
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,920
 or if you really did just stop breathing altogether,

807
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,760
 you would die.

808
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,220
 In order for you to take your next breath,

809
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,240
 you have to release the breath you're holding.

810
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,800
 And so it is with forgiveness.

811
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,260
 If we want to receive forgiveness,

812
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,040
 we need to be able to release forgiveness to others as well.

813
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:07,620
 Like I said, though, this is the starting point.

814
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,700
 Right, this is just the introduction to this journey.

815
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,500
 And there's no way we can unpack and discover

816
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,740
 all the things that forgiveness means for us

817
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,860
 in one short sermon on a Sunday morning.

818
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,760
 So I want to encourage everybody here.

819
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,600
 Please try to come along, right,

820
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,040
 to the next few messages that we have,

821
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,700
 to the next few Sundays that we have

822
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,520
 in this journey of forgiveness.

823
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,560
 And this is not about, you know,

824
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,160
 like maintaining numbers at the Vine

825
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,180
 or anything like that, right, it's not about that.

826
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,600
 But what this is, is it's for your wholeness.

827
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,280
 It's for your understanding.

828
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,520
 It's for you to really be able to embrace

829
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,100
 what forgiveness means,

830
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,940
 so you can walk in the freedom of forgiveness.

831
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,240
 After all, Jesus taught us to pray.

832
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,060
 Forgive our sins as we forgive those

833
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,260
 who have sinned against us.

834
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:07,380
 And my heart is, as individuals, but also as a community,

835
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,820
 we will embrace this journey of forgiveness together.

836
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,460
 To step by step, learn what it means

837
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,900
 to receive and to give out

838
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,460
 what forgiveness really means in God's heart.

839
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,380
 This is how we build, continue the kingdom of God

840
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,620
 here on this earth.

841
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:29,420
 So would you pray with me as we start this journey together?

842
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:47,260
 Jesus, we know that this is an issue

843
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,020
 that many of us are wrestling with.

844
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,500
 And even if we're not wrestling with it right at this moment

845
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,820
 there is gonna come a time where we've been wronged

846
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,780
 and we need to offer forgiveness.

847
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,540
 Or someone wrongs us, or we wrong someone else

848
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,760
 and we need to be forgiven.

849
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,860
 And so Lord, I thank you that.

850
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,980
 Our starting point, Lord, is that you have already

851
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,680
 poured forgiveness out for us.

852
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,620
 That you have offered forgiveness to us despite our sin,

853
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,580
 despite the ways that we've missed the mark

854
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,420
 when it comes to being in relationship with you, Lord.

855
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,200
 You've given us everything we need.

856
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,260
 Your most precious gift so that we can have forgiveness.

857
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,240
 Lord, as we receive this gift, Lord,

858
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,380
 we hear that you've also asked us to pour it out

859
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,000
 to those who have wronged us.

860
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,580
 And I know this is a hard journey for some of us to take.

861
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:58,620
 You know, you might be thinking right now,

862
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,440
 if you only knew the pain that I've been through,

863
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,760
 what this person did to me, how that person hurt me.

864
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:14,420
 And Father, we know that you meet us

865
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,820
 in those areas of pain.

866
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,680
 (soft music)

867
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,480
 And so Jesus, I pray that through your gentle guidance

868
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,280
 in the way that only you know how you would teach us

869
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,100
 how to forgive.

870
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,960
 That as we embrace forgiveness in our own hearts,

871
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,560
 it would soften our hearts.

872
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,160
 And as we learn to live a life defined by forgiveness,

873
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,280
 we will reflect your gospel, your grace,

874
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,820
 your mercy to everybody.

875
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,220
 And that even together as a community,

876
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,860
 we can keep encouraging each other in this journey.

877
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,980
 Keep encouraging each other to not keep things hidden,

878
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,440
 but to bring it out into the light when there's been sin,

879
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,040
 when there's been wrong in the community.

880
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,040
 We will not let that just be swept under the carpet.

881
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,040
 But Lord, because we know the proper way

882
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,400
 to deal with these things, we can walk with it together.

883
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,400
 And that this forgiveness that we offer to each other

884
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,120
 reflects, truly reflects the heart that you have for us.

885
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,780
 So Lord, be with us in these next few weeks

886
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,520
 as we walk through this.

887
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,580
 Encourage us, strengthen us, guide us.

888
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,940
 We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

889
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,520
 (gentle music)

890
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,100
 (gentle music)
