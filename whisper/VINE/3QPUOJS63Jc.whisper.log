[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   Church, I am so conscious of the importance of the Word that I'm carrying in my heart
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.080]   for us today as a congregation.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.080]   We're in week three of our different spirit series.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.960]   If this is your first Sunday back or if you haven't had a chance yet to connect to the
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.560]   other weeks, we want to encourage you to do so.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.560]   They're all online.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.520]   But I'm carrying something in my spirit for those in this room and for those that are
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.420]   watching right now.
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.960]   Wherever you are watching from around the world, in whatever room you're watching in,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.520]   I believe that what we're talking about today is absolutely critical.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.040]   I've been talking about this reality here in this series that we're in an inflection
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.520]   point for the gospel in our city.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.360]   I've said week in and week out, and I'm going to say it and continue to say it, that I think
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.180]   we are at this inflection point where either the church in Hong Kong is going to move forward
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.600]   in this season and in this hour with hope and love and forgiveness and reconciliation
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.500]   and the character of God into this city at this time, or we're going to find ourselves
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.840]   retreating backwards into the shadows of irrelevancy and despondency.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.080]   I think God is calling us and asking us, "What are we going to do?
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.000]   Are we going to rise up in this time with energy and love and faith and step boldly
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.760]   into our future, or are we going to retreat back?
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.000]   Are we going to hold," in other words, "a different spirit, a different spirit that
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.560]   we're seeing in the world right now, a different spirit from all of the stuff that seems to
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.920]   be taking place and decisions that seem to be making?
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.080]   Are we going to say, 'No, no, we're Christians.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.080]   That matters.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.560]   That means something for this time and this context and in this hour.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.000]   I want to be a part of an army that moves forward in this time and doesn't retreat.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.320]   I don't think Christ died on the cross so I can retreat.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.040]   I think Christ died and rose again, so I've got something to say, not because I'm awesome,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.800]   but because He's awesome and the gospel is alive in me.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.840]   There is a different spirit for this moment and this time and this hour.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.920]   I'm going to go forward."
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.640]   Now here's the thing, church.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.840]   There's one thing that is going to stop us from moving forward more than any other thing.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.880]   There's one thing that will cause us to freeze in the place that we're in and want to retreat
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.400]   from the promises of God.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.680]   That thing is the giant of fear.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.720]   And we've seen that giant manifest itself this week.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:36.800]   When one person of one ethnic group gets this disease, everyone else, 350,000 of them, need
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   to respond.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   That's fear, my friends.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   I'm a little angry about it.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.360]   I've got to leave my anger before the Lord.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   Sorry, Jesus.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.480]   I love my city and my government and I pray for it.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.440]   I do.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.640]   But fear is going to hold us back as the church in this hour and in this time.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.560]   And what we need to do is be aware of what fear is, how fear manifests in our lives,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.800]   how we can then deal with fear so that we might be the people with the gospel for this
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.480]   context, for this moment, and for this time.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.920]   I wonder if anybody in this room and online, are you with me?
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.000]   We don't want to be slaves to fear.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.560]   We've just sung it, haven't we?
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.520]   I get the great joy of helping you today break the chains of fear over your life.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.640]   I actually believe that what we're going to talk about in the next 30 minutes can change
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.160]   your life.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.640]   I believe that every week, by the way.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.920]   That's just something I do.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.720]   But this week, I really believe God wants to heal and restore and redeem you.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.320]   Let me start by giving you some general observations about fear.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.800]   Here's the first thing.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.480]   Fear is a God-given emotion that is not evil in itself.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.480]   Come on, church.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.880]   You need to realize that fear is actually God-created.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.880]   It is an emotion He wants you to feel at times.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.720]   That fear actually is a protector and a helper to us.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.680]   That there are some very legitimate reasons in our lives at times where fear will help
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.000]   to protect us, will help to enable us to survive in our lives.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.880]   So fear is not in and of itself evil.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.840]   But as Christians, I think sometimes we give fear like a really bad rap all the time.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840]   That's the first thing.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.520]   Fear is not in and of itself evil.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.640]   But here's the second thing.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.560]   There are two types of fear that will be a reality in your life, rational fear and irrational
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.560]   fear.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.320]   Both of these things, rational fear and irrational fear, both of them are true, both of them
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.080]   are reality, and both of them are powerful.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.560]   One of the keys of unlocking fear in your life is to be able to discern between, "Is
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.320]   this a rational fear that I'm feeling, or am I feeling an irrational fear that's at
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.680]   work in my life?"
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.840]   And your ability to discern between those two things will be a long way to helping you
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.480]   begin to process your fear in healthful and kingdom-advancing ways.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.080]   I want you to know this.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.360]   The enemy is always at work turning a rational fear in your life into something completely
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.160]   irrational.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.480]   That's what the enemy wants to do.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.020]   Take COVID for an example.
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.960]   This pandemic we're in, there's a rational fear to it.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.880]   I mean, this is a dangerous disease.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.240]   We've seen this disease take many of our loved ones in this room over this last year and
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.240]   a half.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.040]   We have a rationality to being afraid and being fearful of catching this disease.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.640]   But we can take what is rational and allow rumor and opinion and social media and everything
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.200]   else, blow it up into something that it's actually not, and find us so irrationally
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.680]   fearful of this disease that that now shapes everything that we do.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.360]   It even begins to shape public policy.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.800]   Come on, church.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.440]   We have to find ourselves with the ability, with a different spirit to discern between
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.000]   what is irrational and what is rational.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.720]   Here's the third thing.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.840]   You are never going to be completely free from fear.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.480]   Ooh, preach on this one for a bit.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.040]   Some of you need an expectation shift, and that's going to bring you some freedom.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.400]   You're never going to be completely free from fear in your life.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.680]   Some of you in this room think that if you are a Christian, it means you get a fear-free
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.680]   life.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.960]   Being a Christian is not about you being completely free of fear.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.400]   Being a Christian is about you not being a slave to fear.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   That's a different thing.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.000]   And we need to understand the difference between that, because that will set us up for greater
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   freedom.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.440]   That I'm never going to completely get fear out of my life, how I respond to fear, what
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.440]   I allow fear to do for me, whether fear will drive me towards God's grace and His humility
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.360]   and His promises, or will fear enslave me and move me away?
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.220]   See, here's the reality.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.560]   Irrational fear is at work through the enemy in your life to cause you to be so close to
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.200]   God's promises and go, "We cannot do it."
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.600]   And it will cause you to walk in the opposite direction to the one that God wants.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.280]   Some of you in this room, you've got dreams and you've got hopes.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.360]   I mean, you've got things that are sitting on your heart and they seem impossible to
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   you.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.800]   The enemy is going to throw so much fear in your face that you're willing to walk in the
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   opposite direction.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.040]   Let me say this.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.560]   Somebody with a different spirit is not somebody who is free from fear.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.320]   It is someone who has decided that fear is not going to determine their ultimate destination.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.760]   That's what Christ calls us to.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.440]   So these four things, that fear is a God-given emotion, that we're going to have rational
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.720]   and irrational fears, that we're never going to be completely free from fear, and yet we
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.720]   can have autonomy over what fear is going to do in our lives, these four things are
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.120]   the foundation of everything I'm going to talk about in my message today.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.600]   In fact, these are the four things that are the foundation of the passage of Scripture
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.720]   that we're about to go to.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.560]   I want to help you be free from fear.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.400]   Now let me say this.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.920]   We've been for three weeks now, this is the third week, sitting in this story of Numbers
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.840]   13 and 14, the 12 spies that are sent into the Promised Land.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.800]   Before we open the passage, let me remind us of that context.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:33.960]   Here's Israel after many, many months, having gone from slavery in Egypt, all the miraculous
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:40.000]   works of God, now they're at literally the footstep, the doorstep of the Promised Land.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.840]   And this land has been promised to them for many months.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.520]   God has spoken many times about a land flowing with milk and honey, that that land is here
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.560]   and ready for them.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.560]   And here's Israel camping right there at the doorstep.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.240]   Twelve spies go in and they bring back a report.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.200]   And that report is two things, grapes and giants.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.020]   Grapes representing the beauty of the fruitfulness of the land, that the land indeed is flowing
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.280]   with milk and honey, that the land of God's inheritance is one that is fruitfulness.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.400]   The grapes represent the promises of God.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.260]   God promised us this land.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.400]   Look at these grapes.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.260]   It proves His promises.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.160]   But on the other side, there are giants in the land.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.280]   And they come back, the 12 spies with grapes, yes, but also giants.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.200]   Fortified cities, really scary people, really strong warriors.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.760]   And the question that we looked at last week is, which one of these two are Israel?
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:37.240]   Which one of these two is Hong Kong and our city and our church going to listen to?
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:44.680]   Because the grapes feel really feeble in the mighty shadow of the giants.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.560]   Two of them are willing to go, "We see the giants, but we're going to believe in the
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.560]   grapes."
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.040]   Ten of them go, "We can only see the giants."
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.480]   We know there's a little bit of fruit, but man, these giants are so overwhelming that
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.160]   we cannot do it.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.120]   And guess what happens?
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.280]   Majority opinion wins.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:11.200]   We saw last week that they begin to spread a bad report about the good news of the land.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:19.080]   And that bad report stirs up so much fear in them that I want to show you what happens.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.200]   Here is in Numbers 14.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.680]   Is this helping somebody already?
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.720]   All right.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.720]   You have to say that.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.080]   Thank you for saying that.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.920]   The night, this is Numbers 14 verse 1.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.640]   That night, all the people of the community raised their voices and wept aloud.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.000]   All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.240]   And the whole assembly said to them, "If only we had died in Egypt or in this desert.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.880]   Why is the Lord bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword?
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.120]   I mean, our wives and our children will be taken as plunder.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.080]   I mean, surely wouldn't it have been better for us to go back to Egypt?"
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.760]   And they came and said to each other, "We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt."
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:07.040]   I want you to see what happens when irrational fear becomes completely irrational.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.040]   So here's Israel.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.080]   And the 12 spies have gone in and they come back.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.540]   And remember what we said last week, all 12 saw the same things, grapes and giants.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.360]   And I believe, although it doesn't say it in the scripture, I think all 12 of them quite
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:26.680]   rightly saw the obstacles to taking the promised land and were anxious about those obstacles.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.480]   Those giants are big.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.480]   The cities are fortified.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:35.880]   I think even Caleb and Joshua were not blind to the fear, the rational fear of the reality
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.600]   of what was in that land.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.040]   It meant that it was going to be difficult for them to go in and take it.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.400]   It meant that there was going to be some challenges ahead.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.000]   And I'm sure those challenges for all 12 of them created a fear in them.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Here's the difference.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   10 of them decide that that fear is so great that they're going to magnify the fear amongst
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.120]   the rest of Israel.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.700]   And so what you see is that they begin to spread a bad report.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:05.220]   They actually magnify what is a rational fear and they make it completely irrational.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.660]   They do this with the language they use.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.100]   They go like, "This land is going to devour us."
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.420]   They're the descendants of the Nephilim, the mythical great giants.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.760]   We feel like grasshoppers in their eyes.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.280]   I mean, they are blowing this thing up.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.020]   This is exaggeration.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.300]   You need to know this.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:33.740]   Fear is always the currency of choice when it comes to social capital.
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.580]   Like if we want to get a group of people to do something, we're going to fill them with
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:42.540]   fear because fear is a greater motivator than love.
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.300]   If we really want to get a bunch of people to do things, we're going to tell them how
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.860]   bad these people groups are.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.500]   We're going to tell them how fearful they need to be of this type of person.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.940]   We're going to tell them all of this to get them to do what we want.
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.380]   So here's the 10 and they're magnifying what's a rational fear and they're making it into
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.660]   irrational fear.
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.180]   Are you following this?
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.700]   And in doing that, they're trying to get Israel to change their direction.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.980]   Now note this.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.540]   It says here in the passage that all of Israel raised their voices and wept aloud.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:17.060]   "This is the worst thing that's ever happened to us."
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.100]   They haven't even been in the promised land.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.100]   They haven't seen the giants.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.620]   They don't know how big the cities are.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.220]   Everybody only the 10 and the 2 have actually seen, but everybody else is like, "Oh my gosh,
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.100]   this is the worst thing that's ever happened."
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:35.540]   Because they're believing in the exaggerated majority report and that's created a rational
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.540]   fear.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.180]   I wonder how many of us in this room are sitting with a rational fear in our lives because
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.100]   you believe in the majority exaggerated report.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.660]   Whether that's for your business, whether that's in your marriage, whether it's in the
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:53.340]   city here and in our politics and the culture here, whatever it might be, there's an exaggerated
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.340]   report.
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.820]   You're believing it and that's created a rational fear.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.140]   Notice what happens when we have a rational fear.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.140]   Verse 2, all the Israelites, first of all, grumbled.
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.740]   Oh, I'm going to preach on this one for a moment.
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.180]   Here's what happens when you have fear in your life.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:14.740]   You start to grumble and complain and get angry at people and upset and you think it's
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.420]   everybody else's fault and not yours.
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.420]   Fear when it goes unchecked in our lives creates a complaining, a grumbling that suddenly we're
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.660]   not satisfied anymore with what is going on in our lives.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.980]   We're not happy anymore.
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.460]   We so dislike the feeling of fear that we want to run in the opposite direction.
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.460]   And the first place we do is we want to say, "This is not my problem.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.140]   This is not my fault.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.380]   This is not my thing.
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.900]   This is everybody else's issue.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:50.060]   Who can I find to blame for the uncomfortable feeling that I'm feeling?"
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.060]   Anyone done that?
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.740]   Okay, you're all lying.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.740]   That's great.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.700]   I want you to notice where they put their fear.
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.700]   They grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.300]   I mean, who can we find?
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.300]   Who can we find?
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.300]   Oh, I know.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.100]   The two men that have so brilliantly led us out of slavery to the promised land.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.740]   The two men that have listened to the Word of God more than anyone else.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.460]   The two men that have been on their knees and have been facedown before God more than
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.820]   the two men that seen God face to face.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.100]   The two men, those two.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.100]   You know what?
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.980]   It's their fault.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.380]   I'm so uncomfortable.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.700]   I'm so filled with fear.
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.500]   It must be Moses and Aaron.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.900]   I call this victim blaming.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.900]   Follow this, church.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.260]   This is what unchecked fear is going to do in your life.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.360]   It's going to cause you to feel like you're a victim.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:40.760]   And when you feel like you're a victim, you have a desire to blame somebody for your victimness.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:46.160]   Like who can I find to blame for the reality that I feel like I'm a victim in this place?
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.000]   Here's the irony about all of this.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.480]   This is the enemy's strategy.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.460]   Your fear that you're feeling is your feeling.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.680]   Come on, church.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.400]   It's your feeling.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.320]   It's in you.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.780]   Why are you trying to blame someone externally for something that's internally in you?
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.440]   This is what the enemy does.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.960]   He wants to so get you to go, "No, this is something I'm dealing with.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.960]   I'm feeling fear.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.580]   There may even be a legitimate reason why I'm feeling that fear.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.040]   But the reality is it's my fear and I need to face that fear and do it."
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   No, no, no.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.960]   We go, "It's your fault.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.140]   You're the reason why I'm feeling fearful.
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.000]   And if you would change, then I would feel a lot better.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.160]   Thank you very much."
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.600]   We put ourselves in the place of the victim trying to blame someone else.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.920]   You need to know this.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:41.880]   You're doing that to give yourself a temporary sense of comfort in the midst of your fear.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:50.200]   See, victim blaming gives us a sort of false sense of comfort in the realities of what
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.800]   we're going for by actually enabling us to express our feelings outwards by pointing
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.920]   them out in someone else.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.800]   We want to point out all the brokenness in somebody else to try to make ourselves feel
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.920]   temporarily better about the fear we're in.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.440]   You need to know this, church.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.280]   Some of the reasons why I think we've had so much disunity in our city in the last couple
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.460]   of years, some of the reasons why we've seen divisions in families and in workplaces and
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:18.920]   in churches is because all of us are in this victim blaming mode because we don't want
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.680]   to or we don't know how to deal with the fear that is in our lives.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.600]   And I wonder whether what the Holy Spirit might be saying is those with a different
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.440]   spirit are willing to go, "You know what?
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.520]   It starts and ends here.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.260]   This is my feeling.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.280]   And I need to have some way of processing this feeling.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.160]   And by blaming you, that might give me a temporary relief, but it's not dealing with actually
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.160]   what's inside."
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.160]   I'm hot.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.160]   I'm physically hot.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.160]   I'm just physically hot.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.640]   It's hot in here.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.440]   Does anyone else hot in here?
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.440]   I'm hot.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.120]   All right, now notice what happens next.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.400]   So they're blaming Moses and Aaron.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.280]   They're trying to get rid of their feelings by temporarily blaming somebody else.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.280]   Verse 3, "Why is the Lord bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword?"
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.360]   Here's what happens if you adopt a victim blaming mentality to deal with your fear.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.000]   You will never stop at people and you will always end up blaming God.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.560]   You'll always go to that next level.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:29.480]   You see, the outworking of unchecked fear in our lives is always the rebellion of God.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.520]   And so Israel, they're on the doorstep of everything that was promised to them.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.440]   And they say, "Why has God led us here?
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.720]   It's not just Moses and Aaron's fault.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.480]   It must also be God's fault because how can this be God's good idea?"
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:49.840]   A few years ago in 2006, God said to me, "Andrew, it's time to start a family."
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.520]   So my wife and I, we started to try to have a family.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.680]   Two years later, we're in the doctors.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.640]   And we're like, "We can't have a family.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.640]   Why can't we have a family?
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.240]   It must be Chris's fault."
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.240]   So we have all these experiments.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.240]   They do all these tests.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.240]   I'm not going to give you the details.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.520]   And at the end of that time, they say to Chris, "You are the most reproductive person we've
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.820]   ever seen.
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.800]   You could have babies all over the place.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.360]   Andrew, we need to talk.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.640]   Turns out I have azuspermia.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.120]   It's a condition that means that although I'm physically and biologically perfect, I
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.240]   cannot produce sperm.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.060]   Like it's just not there."
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:40.680]   And so I'm sitting here going, "Hmm, God, you said it was time to have a family, to
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.000]   start a family.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.620]   And then you created me biologically so it was impossible for me to do so.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.000]   Is this just like some divine joke?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Here's Israel.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.040]   You promised us this promised land, but there are such big giants there that we're just
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.920]   going to die to their sword.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.720]   Like is this just a big joke?"
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:08.680]   Fear, if it's loose in your life, will always lead you to the point where you're disagreeing
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:14.880]   with the promises of God in your life, where you're willing to call into question what
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.520]   God has said to you.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.280]   God said, "Andrew, it's time to start a family."
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.520]   He wanted me to go through the process of realizing that that wasn't going to happen
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:30.400]   biologically so he can give me a beautiful half Nepalese, half Nepal, we call her Nepalese,
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.680]   she's half Nepal, half Indonesian.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.560]   And she's the most beautiful awesomeness.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.200]   Like she is my daughter.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.880]   That's the one that God wanted me to have.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.880]   But I had to go through all of this.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.040]   And in the midst of that, I was blaming God.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   I hated God.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.040]   I didn't want to go to church.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   I didn't want to pray.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:51.560]   It was all God's fault because I wasn't being willing to deal with the fear of what it would
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.240]   mean if I didn't be a father.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:02.240]   Some of you here, you're blaming God for something that he actually just wants to heal in you.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.480]   And there's a process that he's opening up in your life where you can respond today to
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.200]   what he's actually trying to say.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.480]   Now notice the final thing that happens.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.880]   Verse four, "And then they said to each other, 'We should choose a leader and go back to
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.880]   Egypt.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.680]   We're going to give up on Moses and Aaron.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.280]   We're going to give up on God.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.600]   We're going to find a new leader.'"
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.600]   Guess what?
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.600]   People do this all the time.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.480]   They're like, "Who tells us what we want to do?
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.680]   Like who agrees with my opinion?
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.120]   Let's find a leader who's going to do what I want.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.440]   Let's find a leader who's going to also fill the fear in the same way so that we can go
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.440]   back into it."
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.640]   We would rather be in slavery.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.720]   You remember those 438 years when we were oppressed by Egyptians, when that was really
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.720]   hard?
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.200]   Man, that was great compared to this.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:50.320]   Like we would rather go back there to Egypt than to step forward and fight some big looking
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.320]   warrior dudes.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   I would rather be enslaved.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.120]   Here's the reality.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:01.480]   If you allow fear to go unchecked in your life, you will always choose to find something
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:10.240]   that enslaves you if it will help you to feel less of the discomfort of fear.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.960]   Some of you in this room, legitimate fear in your life that maybe has been blown up
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:21.520]   to some irrationality, and you're placating that fear by enslaving yourself to alcohol
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.920]   because it gives you a temporary relief from feeling that way.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.000]   Or maybe it's not alcohol.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Maybe it's Netflix.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.400]   I've said that a lot in the last couple of weeks.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.620]   I really like Netflix, trust me.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.960]   Or maybe it's an affair that you're having on your spouse, or maybe it's whatever it
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:44.040]   is for you, but it's the thing that you turn to in order to release that feeling of fear,
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:50.120]   the thing that enslaves you into an addictive thing in order for you to feel temporarily
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.280]   better than the fear in your life.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.680]   Is anyone with me?
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.680]   Here's Israel right on the precipice, and they're like, "I would rather have this in
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:02.200]   slavery thing than actually have the concern of facing the giants in the land."
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.440]   Here's the reality.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:10.760]   Every single one of us has an Egypt that we're tempted to return to because of the fear of
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.680]   the giants in the land of God's promises.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.320]   That's the inflection point before the church in our city right now.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:24.000]   Are we going to retreat back to just doing church as a little holy huddle on a Sunday
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.160]   and make sure we don't say anything that's going to upset anyone?
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.080]   Or are we actually going to step forward with the gospel the way the gospel was always meant
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.080]   to be lived?
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.760]   Are we going to allow ourselves to be enslaved, or are we going to move forward in freedom?
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.120]   That's the question.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.920]   Here's Israel, and they're so overwhelmed with fear.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.720]   And I say, "Here's Andrew," and I'm so at times overwhelmed with fear that I want to
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:54.280]   retreat to the things that enslave me rather than trust in the uncertainty of faith.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:58.760]   I would rather trust in the comfort and the security of the things that enslave me than
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.640]   the uncertainty of what might make me free.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   Come on, church.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.120]   I wonder if anyone else in this room feels that way.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.080]   So let me pull all this together into an amazing Andrew Gardner diagram that you can take a
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.080]   photo of.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.480]   Are you ready?
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.800]   I call this the fear cycle, and this is what we've just seen in verses 1 to 4.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.680]   First of all, there's an obstacle in the land that God wants us to move into.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:27.600]   The giants of God are there, and out of that obstacle comes fear.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.560]   And this is the turning point.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.800]   What do we do with that fear?
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.160]   Remember, you're never going to escape fully from fear in your life.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.040]   So this is the turning point.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.600]   How are we going to respond to the obstacle and the fear that rationally it creates?
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.880]   Well, we respond here with complaining and grumbling.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.080]   And as we complain and we grumble, as we find that place of trying to get some instant satisfaction
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.960]   for how we're feeling, it leads us into that victim-blaming mentality.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.000]   It's all these other people's faults.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.600]   I'm not going to take responsibility or autonomy for how I'm feeling.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.520]   I'm going to blame everybody else, which if that's not checked, that ends up in rebellion
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:07.360]   with God and before God, and that rebellion always drives us into a place of slavery.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.480]   I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.800]   Really?
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:19.120]   Because if fear is unchecked in our lives, it's always going to lead us back into a place
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   of slavery.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.120]   Helpful?
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.400]   Now, here's the question.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.680]   How do we break the fear cycle?
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.240]   I mean, how do we actually change this in our lives?
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.360]   How do we live in a different spirit in this different hour?
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.800]   Well, let's keep reading in the passage.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   Is this helping anyone?
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   Anyone in the upper house?
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.800]   Good.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   Thanks, Katie.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   Anyone online?
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.800]   Is this helping you?
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.800]   Let us know in the comment section.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.520]   We want to know.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:53.040]   Verse 5 says this, "Then Moses and Aaron fell face down in front of the whole of the Israelite
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.400]   assembly gathered there.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.960]   Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.160]   land, tore their clothes and said to the entire Israelite assembly, 'The land we pass through
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.120]   and explore is exceedingly good.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.800]   If the Lord is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.840]   and honey, and will give it to us.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.000]   Only do not rebel against the Lord."
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   There it is.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.040]   "Don't allow your fear to cause you to rebel against the Lord.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:26.200]   And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will swallow them up.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.720]   Their protection is gone, but the Lord is with us."
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.040]   So do not be afraid.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.760]   Everybody say, "Do not be afraid."
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.760]   Do not be afraid.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:44.040]   I want you to see how the fear cycle is broken by four people with a different spirit, Moses,
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.120]   Aaron, Caleb, Joshua.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:51.640]   First of all, verse 5, "Then Moses and Aaron fell face down in front of the whole Israelite
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.960]   assembly gathered there."
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.080]   Moses and Aaron are being attacked.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.080]   You are not our leaders.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.440]   You're the ones to blame.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.920]   You are terrible people.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.640]   They're feeling the whole of Israel coming against them.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.120]   Do they stand up and try to fight back their haters?
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.520]   Do they try to reply to that tweet with another tweet?
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.280]   Are they trying to fight back the people?
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.600]   Are they trying to blame others?
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.960]   No, here's what they do.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.640]   They fall face down.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.800]   Like if I was there, I'd be like, "What?"
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   Like come on, guys.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.800]   Get some strength.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.880]   We want to hear from you.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.200]   They're face down before the whole of the Israelite assembly.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.320]   They're not face down in honor of them.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.320]   They're face down in honor of God.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.600]   See, the posture of being face down throughout all of the scriptures is a posture of the
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.840]   fear of the Lord.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.240]   It's the posture we put ourselves into.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:46.280]   And what it means is humble submission and the recognition that we have great need.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.360]   Moses and Aaron don't try to defend themselves.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.560]   They don't try to fight back.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.640]   They don't try to push back the haters.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.360]   They fall down before God and they say, "I will not succumb to human fear.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.600]   I will replace human fear with the fear of God."
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:05.720]   Like I'm going to make a stand here, face down on my face, before everybody to say that
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.000]   there is a greater fear than what you're talking about.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.040]   And that is the fear of God.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.320]   It's not the same kind of fear.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.640]   The fear of man or the human fear is just like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so scared.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.640]   I'm so worried.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.640]   I'm so anxious."
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.360]   The fear of the Lord is God.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.680]   You are mightier and more powerful than anything in all the universe.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.040]   With just one thought, you can dramatically change everything.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.760]   I will submit myself.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:34.920]   I will put myself at the mercy of a God who could wipe me out or raise me up with just
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.080]   a little thought in his mind.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.720]   That's the person I come to when I'm feeling overwhelmed in fear.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.520]   I need help.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:53.800]   But you see, the problem is we allow our pride and the fact that it's everybody else's fault
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.320]   to make us think that we're strong in saying that, when actually our posture must be the
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.320]   fear of the Lord.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:06.440]   See, human fear freezes us, but the fear of the Lord puts dancing feet upon us.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.880]   Human fear shackles.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.560]   The fear of the Lord sets free.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:19.160]   Moses and Aaron physically demonstrate a different spirit before the Israelites.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.120]   And in so doing, they welcome them to respond.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.120]   Notice what happens next.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.120]   This is fun.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.120]   This is fun, isn't it?
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:32.160]   Verse 6, "Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jonathan, were there among the..."
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.440]   Verse 7, "And said to the entire Israelite assembly," here's what they say, "The land
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.000]   we passed through and explored is exceedingly good."
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.120]   The two with the different spirit, Joshua and Caleb, stand up in front of everybody.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.400]   Now remember, notice the difference here.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:51.280]   Face down, they now stand up before everybody and they go, "Hey, the land is not like the
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.120]   report you're believing.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.680]   You are irrationally believing something.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.920]   Yes, there is this reality of the giants and the land, but let me remind you, it's not
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.120]   about the giants, it's the grapes.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.120]   Grapes.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.120]   Grapes.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.120]   Grapes.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.040]   They don't say like, "The cities are extremely big."
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.960]   They say, "The land is exceedingly good.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.200]   No matter how small the grapes might feel in the shadow of the mighty giants, it is
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   good."
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   Why is it good?
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.880]   Because God's promised it to us.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.920]   They start to twist, to turn and walk in the opposite spirit in the report that the Israelites
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.920]   have given.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.840]   Fear will drive you to try to freeze you.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.720]   They're trying to go, "No, don't believe the majority.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:38.200]   The grapes are exceedingly good."
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.760]   I didn't feel that way this week.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:47.840]   This week I was upset, angry, frustrated, heartbroken for the Filipino and Indonesian
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.800]   foreign domestic workers in our city, for the 400 people that are suddenly in lockdown
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   in one building.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.080]   I was upset about that.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.760]   And it was really hard to see the grapes this week.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:06.040]   But I stand before you today, almost wanting to walk in the opposite spirit to how I'm
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040]   feeling.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.800]   And I say this, Hong Kong is still exceedingly good.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:19.520]   That God has not given up on this land, that there is still hope, even in a week when it
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.480]   seems like the grapes have been crushed.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:30.040]   Those of the different spirit are willing and able to actually say, to declare before
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:36.600]   the giants of fear in the land, "This land is indeed exceedingly good."
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.400]   That I believe the grapes over the giants.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:47.040]   Caleb and Joshua are trying to get Israelites to remember the promises that were there.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.880]   And then notice what happens finally in verse nine.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.400]   "Only do not rebel against the Lord and do not be afraid of the people of the land because
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.560]   we will swallow them up.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:59.640]   Their protection is gone, but the Lord is with us.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.840]   Do not be afraid for He's with us.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.520]   He's not with them.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.900]   He's not with their fortified city and their massive people.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.600]   He's not with all the armory they have and how great an army they've got.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.440]   He's with us.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.420]   And the grapes are proof that He is still with us.
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.560]   He's not given up on us, but you want to go back to Egypt?
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.360]   God's not in Egypt.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.280]   He's not in the place of slavery.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.840]   He's in a land of freedom.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.840]   He's right there.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.680]   We're standing right next to it.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.100]   Come on.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.680]   He's with us in this.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.680]   See this is amazing.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.080]   Where everybody else wants to rebel against God.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.440]   Here's Joshua and Caleb and they're like, "No, no, no.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.920]   It's not about rebelling against God.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.960]   It's about inviting His presence.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.600]   It's about reminding ourselves that He is with us."
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.560]   Fear will always do this in your life.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:54.520]   Fear is always designed to make you feel like you are alone.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.560]   That is such a lie.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.560]   You are not alone.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:03.240]   Jesus calls Himself Emmanuel, God with us for a reason.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:10.360]   He is with you always and because He is, your fear can be overcome.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.900]   Because God and His presence and Jesus is actually with us.
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.000]   And if He is with us, who can forsake us?
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.040]   Greater is His love in me than the fear that is in this world.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.440]   I am a child of God.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.440]   Why?
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.440]   Because I'm special?
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:30.100]   No, because He's standing right next to me with His arm around me and we alongside of
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.960]   each other are walking into our future.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.880]   I will not retreat into slavery.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.960]   I will make a stand face down before the Lord, acknowledging my need, knowing it's not in
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:46.920]   my strength, remembering His promises, inviting His Spirit so that I could know not the complete
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:53.760]   eradication of fear, but that I'm no longer a slave to it.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.560]   So let me bring all this back to another diagram.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.640]   Here's the fear cycle.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.360]   Remember this?
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.440]   Here's what Moses, Aaron, Joshua and Caleb give us.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.200]   They give us what I call the faith cycle.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   It starts out very similar.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.600]   There are obstacles in the land and those obstacles create fear.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.320]   That's the reality for all of us in all of our contexts.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:19.480]   But is that fear going to cause us to complain or grumble or are we going to lie face down
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.760]   and acknowledge the needs that we have?
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.320]   Are we going to put ourselves in humble submission before God and say, "You know what?
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.320]   It's not about victim blaming.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.760]   It's not about pointing out everybody else's problems.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:38.680]   It's about taking responsibility for how I'm feeling and doing this, remembering the promises
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.120]   of God for myself.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.200]   Like I'm going to remember those things.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.920]   I'm going to do my best to do that, not to tell everybody else how bad and wrong they
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.800]   are, but actually finding myself, you know what?
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.920]   God is still good.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:57.480]   So therefore I'm not going to rebel against Him, but in the faith cycle I will find myself
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:02.520]   inviting His presence, "Oh God, I need you.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.760]   I am overwhelmed with a rational fear.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.840]   I need you.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:17.200]   Would you come and be with me so that I don't move into slavery, but I receive freedom?"
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.120]   That's the faith cycle you see in Numbers 14 verses 5 to 6.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.120]   It's the thing that I believe can set you free.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.880]   Not because you're so strong and awesome, not because you've got all these great mechanisms
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:34.000]   to deal with fear, but because you lie face down before the Lord and acknowledge your
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.720]   need of Him.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:43.080]   Because you recall, even in a week like this, that His word and His promises are still good.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:47.680]   That you're able then to invite His presence, knowing that you cannot do it alone.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.360]   But because of Christ and His death and resurrection, you are never alone.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.400]   And in inviting His presence, you feel His forgiveness and His life and His mercy.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:03.160]   And suddenly the fear diminishes and faith rises.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:10.320]   And you are able to proclaim in Hong Kong, "The land is exceedingly good.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.020]   Do not be afraid."
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.240]   You want to have a different spirit?
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.800]   Break the fear cycle and walk confidently into the land that God has given us.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   Would you stand with me?
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.800]   I want to pray for you.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:29.680]   And here's what I want to do today.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.760]   Let's just take this moment.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.560]   We've got 15 minutes before this service is supposed to be finished.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.400]   Praise the Lord Jesus.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:43.160]   And I want to use that 15 minutes to pray for you.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.600]   I believe there are people in this room that need ministry together today.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.760]   Sometimes at the Vine, we often push ministry at the end of the service, after it.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.560]   But we've carved out time today to do it right here, right now.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.520]   And whether you're in the upper house, we've got some pastors and prayer team there.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:03.040]   Or whether you're here in the lower house, we've got pastors and prayer team here too.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.600]   We're going to carve out now the next 10 minutes to minister to one another.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.400]   And so I want to invite the prayer team, if you could just come and stand here at the
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.400]   front.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.400]   If you're one of the pastors of the church, I invite you also to be here.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.320]   And in a moment, I'm going to pray for us.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.040]   And then I'm going to invite you to come forward and receive prayer.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:25.440]   In the upper house, we've got Katie on the left, and we've got Tim on the right.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.040]   And I want to encourage you in the upper house in a moment to come forward and receive prayer.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.360]   Maybe this message has meant something personally to you today.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.680]   Remember the starting point in breaking the cycle is face down.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:42.280]   It's actually being willing to put your hand up and saying, "I'm feeling fear."
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.760]   And I need to acknowledge that reality in my life, and I need to have someone pray for
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.760]   me today.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.120]   And by you coming forward in a moment, that's part of your breaking of the cycle.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:56.880]   I want to come and get prayer from somebody in the church to stand with me at this time.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.680]   And then in that prayer, we're going to speak the promises of God over you.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:05.560]   We're going to invite His presence into whatever context and situation you're fearful of, so
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:12.480]   that we can stand together unified as a church and not allow fear to determine our destination.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.720]   Come on, Vine.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.440]   We're not going to allow fear to determine our destination.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:23.200]   And so would you take this time to be ministered to if you would like that and if that means
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.200]   something for you?
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.160]   And if you don't come forward, that's fine.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.000]   Of course, you can receive ministry where you are as well.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.400]   But perhaps today you're like, "You know what?
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.640]   This is my time to come forward.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.600]   I need to have someone stand with me."
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.600]   Let's pray.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   Open your hands with me.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.040]   Father, we just invite you now in this moment and in this time.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.920]   We invite your presence here.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.240]   You've been here, obviously, the whole time.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.440]   But we pray now for a manifestation of your presence in a beautiful way.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:55.320]   Lord, there are many people in this room that would like to receive prayer where fear is
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.440]   a reality.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.880]   Some of us, it's rational.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.320]   Some of us, it's become irrational.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.240]   Some of us, it's just there.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.520]   For others, it's actually determining our direction in life.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.120]   Father, we want to break the chains of that fear.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.640]   We want to break the strategy of the enemy over us.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.280]   We will not stand for slavery.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.280]   Because your presence is here, we are free.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:27.400]   So Lord, I pray in the upper house and the lower house and for everybody online as well,
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.720]   for anyone that's needing a sense of your reality and your presence, would you come
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.720]   now?
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.680]   Church, I want to invite you just to come forward as the team begins to respond in worship.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.680]   Just come forward.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.680]   Take the time to get prayed for.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.040]   We'll take the time to pray for everybody that needs it.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.560]   Let's respond as a church in ministry.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
