[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.600]   Words, voice, sound, speech, the very things that are simple to you have become the sweetest
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.960]   of all sounds to me.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.440]   You know, it's hard to describe what it's like to be rendered silent by an angel for
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.440]   a year, to have those words and the voice and the sound and the speech stilled within
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.440]   you.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.520]   It feels a little bit like the silencing of your soul, to be able to speak and then at
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.160]   a command, nothing but silence for a year.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.800]   My dear wife Elizabeth always jokes that in all of the long, long years of our marriage,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.680]   it was the only time she ever knew true peace.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.800]   True peace.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.880]   If you lend me your ears for a few moments, I want to tell you a little bit about what
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.000]   true peace actually is.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.380]   My story, to understand it, you have to first of all understand my ancestors.
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.160]   I was literally born into the priesthood.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.000]   I'm from the tribe of Abidjar and from the youngest of ages, all I've ever known is what
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.160]   it is to be a priest, be a round priest, to grow up with that as my family.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.720]   You may not know this, but there are 18,000 priests in our land.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.320]   We're broken into 24 different divisions of 750 priests in every division.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.800]   For the majority of our time, we're just in the villages, in our hometowns and studying
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.200]   the scripture and helping people to understand God and the Torah and the prophets.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.320]   It's a joy to be able to walk pastorally with those around us.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.840]   But for two weeks in the year, for two weeks, each division is invited up to serve in Jerusalem,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.160]   to go to the temple, which shines like a jewel on the top of Mount Zion, the beauty of the
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.240]   temple shown to all people.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.240]   We get to be there for two weeks, serving the worshipers in Jerusalem, helping with
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.400]   the sacrifices, providing the daily rituals of prayer and song and music.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.200]   And we get to be there as the priest on behalf of all of the people of the land.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.400]   I've often thought to myself in those two weeks when I'm standing there in the temple
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.680]   how privileged I am, how chosen I am of God, that God would choose me from a young age
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.240]   to be a priest.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.960]   The idea of being chosen is actually what my story is all about.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.520]   One of the things that we do when we're in those two weeks in the temple is one of the
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.120]   priests, only one, but one of the priests is chosen by lot to be the one who can go
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   beyond the curtain into the Holy of Holies, the very place where God's presence is.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.680]   I mean, you can serve as a priest all of your life and never be chosen for that honor.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:18.880]   I had been a priest for 70 years, but on that day, on that one special day, my luck came
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.880]   up.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.080]   I had heard stories, of course, from the other priests over the years of what it was like
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.880]   to be behind the veil, behind the curtain, of what it was like to go inside, to be in
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.360]   the very presence of God.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.760]   Every one of them had talked of the stories of the glory that it felt, the true beauty
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.640]   of being in the presence of God.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.640]   Each one of them had spoken about the intimacy of God's presence, and I longed for it.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.160]   But the thing that they spoke of the most, every single priest who had been beyond the
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.600]   curtain, the one thing they spoke of the most, that they sung songs about, told stories about,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   was this, that it was the first time in their lives that they truly knew peace.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.960]   Peace.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.680]   Peace is an important concept for us Jews.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.440]   Actually, that's not a good way of saying it.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.480]   Let me say it like this.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.520]   Peace is the very foundation and structure of our faith.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.040]   It's what our faith is all about.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.480]   You Gentiles, you often think of peace simply as the idea of the cessation of an argument
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.160]   or the absence of war, but for us Jews, peace isn't about the absence of something.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.080]   It's about the presence of something.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.260]   It's not about what's not there anymore.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.800]   It's about what has come to be there in that moment.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.560]   For us Jews, peace is described by this one word in our tongue, shalom.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.120]   Shalom, literally translated, means wholeness, but it carries with it a much broader set
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.220]   of ideas.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.480]   The ideas of being safe and secure.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.620]   The ideas of being restored.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.400]   The ideas of knowing perfection and trueness.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.800]   The ideas of an intimacy that enables you to truly rest.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.600]   There are other words, too, within this idea of shalom.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   The word shalem, which means restoration.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.280]   The word shalomet, which means to have perfection.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.420]   So for us Jews, when we think of the idea of peace, we're talking about a moment where
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.400]   we come together to know the perfection of God, where we come to understand what it is
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.000]   to truly be human, to be made in His image, where we are finally in a place where wholeness,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.180]   just as we were created to be, actually is.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.700]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.020]   One of my old rabbis once described it to me like this.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.840]   He said, "For us, shalom is, it's like the coming together of two opposing opposites,
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.040]   two separate opposites coming together to form one new shared reality."
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.060]   When those things that are opposed to one another come together and form a new relationship,
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.200]   this is wholeness.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.000]   It is restoration, perfection, shalom, peace.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.120]   All of which brings me back to that day when my lot was chosen.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.580]   I remember feeling incredibly excited.
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.840]   This was my moment to go beyond that veil into the Holy of Holies to witness something
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.920]   of God that I had never witnessed before.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.040]   I remember grabbing the curtain and pulling it back and walking on in.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.000]   Oh, the joy I felt.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.640]   And as the curtain closed behind me, suddenly I heard nothing, silence, which when you come
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.220]   to understand the rest of my story is quite ironic.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.400]   But in that moment, it was beautiful.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.760]   I had just gone from the inner courts where the slaughtering of the animals was, where
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.080]   the worship was taking place, where the prayers were being prayed, the cacophony of noise,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.120]   and then suddenly, absolutely silence.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.480]   Nothing.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.240]   Just me and the presence of God.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.280]   It's hard to describe to you the joy that it feels to have the whole world turned off
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.480]   and only God be with you.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:26.240]   It's hard to explain to you what it was like for me to suddenly know that I was truly,
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.520]   deeply the only one who was in the world for Him.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:37.040]   It felt like the whole world had stopped and there I was caught in the love of Yahweh.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.520]   It was like I was truly me for the very first time.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.840]   In fact, I felt younger.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.120]   I felt like a new man.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.840]   I felt like everything else had changed and suddenly I was who I was truly created to
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.840]   be, the image of God.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.960]   Before God, it was wonderful.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:04.840]   I almost forgot that the reason I was there was to take the incense and to light it.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.920]   So I started to walk towards the incense table and then I realized I was not alone, that
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.320]   there was another person there.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.440]   I thought at first maybe it was another priest who snuck in, who had defied the laws, who
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:24.560]   were going to be killed in the presence of God, but to my relief and horror, it wasn't
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.360]   a man at all.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.680]   There was a being next to the incense table.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.280]   Now I had heard of angels.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.920]   I had read about angels.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:45.980]   I had even taught about angels, but nothing ever had prepared me to encounter an angel.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.200]   It was overwhelming.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.440]   Every part of my body was shaking and trembling.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.480]   It felt like the whole of his gaze was internalizing everything that I had ever done.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.200]   I was overwhelmed with the smallness that I felt in the glory of his presence, the one
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   who is holy, the one who is not holy.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:14.080]   And as I was trembling, he walked forward and he said these words.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.480]   And when he opened his mouth, it felt like the whole of the universe was saying what
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.480]   he was saying.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:26.040]   He says, "Do not be afraid, Zachariah, for your prayers have been heard and answered.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:31.240]   Elizabeth, your wife, will be with child and she will bring forth a son and you will name
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.840]   him John."
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.520]   And then he began to tell me what my son would do.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.280]   My son would be filled with the Holy Spirit from birth.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.900]   My son would be the one who would prepare the way for the coming Messiah.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:49.240]   My son would help to invite Israel to repentance for their sins so that they could be prepared
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.240]   for the arrival of none other than the Son of God.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.240]   My son!
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:59.080]   I mean, the words of the angel seemed like fantasy to me.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:04.200]   Words that I could not comprehend, ideas that I could not fathom, a hope that I had for
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.760]   many years pushed down, gotten rid of, pushed away, silence.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.400]   And I thought in that moment that what if this doesn't happen?
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.160]   What if those angels' words were not true?
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.720]   So I turned to face him.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.920]   And I said, "How can any of this be possible?
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:35.340]   For having you not seen how old I am and Elizabeth is even older, how could we ever?"
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.600]   It was not my finest moment.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.320]   I mean, think about it.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.440]   I'm finally in the wholeness of the presence of God.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.960]   I'm finally the person I was truly created to be.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.640]   And in the moment of being encountered God's presence, I turned my back on him.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   I doubt.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.000]   I doubt the very words that have come from his mouth.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.600]   I doubt the promise that he has brought to me.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:09.120]   I turned my back on the one who has opened his arms to me and immediately I felt old
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.320]   again.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:21.200]   The angel then said these sobering words, "Because you have doubted, Zachariah, your
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:27.320]   tongue now will be stilled and you will not be able to speak again until the prophecy
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:33.320]   I have brought comes to pass," and a weight came in my mouth.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.800]   My tongue stilled within me.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:41.400]   I could no longer make any sound.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.320]   Every day from that moment onwards, every day was a reminder to me of the reality of
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.400]   my doubts and my turning of my back on another.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:57.480]   Every moment of every day realizing that I could not express anything to anyone.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:04.000]   And yet every day, Elizabeth, pregnant with our child, growing and growing.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.200]   She had never been more radiant nor beautiful.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:14.080]   And then that day, the day I thought would never come, the day when Elizabeth gave birth
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.680]   to a boy.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.400]   And then on the eighth day, when we circumcised our children, the child is brought to me and
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:28.280]   all of the family are leaning in, wanting to know, "What will I name him?"
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:34.480]   I grab a parchment and I start to write down the name, "John."
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:41.760]   And I write it out as much as I can in bold letters, "John, his name will be John."
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.440]   And in that moment, you will never guess what happened.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.200]   I felt the rush of the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.840]   I felt like I was lifted up where I was.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.560]   It was almost like the rest of the world disappeared again.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.160]   And there I was back in the holy of holies once more, back in the presence of God again.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.920]   And in that moment, I felt my tongue loosened in my mouth.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:08.760]   I felt like all of those months of agony where I was walking in the brokenness of my doubt
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:15.440]   were washed away, and now suddenly a new moment had arrived where two opposing entities, me
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:21.280]   who had turned my back on God and God who is holy and mighty, now could come together
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.840]   again as one.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.800]   I felt forgiveness.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.400]   I felt life.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.040]   I felt the joy of what it is to know my sins were washed away.

[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:20.740]   Round yon virgin, mother and child.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:29.720]   Holy infant, so tender and mild.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:34.700]   Sleep in heavenly peace.

[00:28:52.140 --> 00:29:02.100]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:08.580]   One of my earliest childhood memories
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.180]   was hearing the word "Meshiach."
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.640]   My father, at the end of every day,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.220]   would gather up the children and put us on his lap.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.780]   And he would tell us the stories of the prophets of old,
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.300]   the stories of our ancestors.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.200]   And the stories he would always go to
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.900]   were the ones about the Meshiach.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:28.540]   I heard that name long before I remember hearing my own name.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:33.220]   "Meshiach" in our tongue literally means "the anointed."
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.020]   The idea of somebody being a Meshiach
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.460]   is that that person has been anointed by Yahweh,
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.700]   that Yahweh has set them aside for a certain period of time
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:47.300]   to do some things that Yahweh wants them to do.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.180]   And so my father would tell us stories
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:53.540]   of Samuel and Isaiah and King David,
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.380]   the ones who had been anointed with oil,
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:02.620]   Meshiached with oil, to become a Meshiach for the people.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.820]   The idea of the oil was really important.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.980]   It was really something that my dad would talk about all
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.780]   the time.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.260]   He would say, in the same way that we pour oil on our hands
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:16.180]   when our hands are chapped and sore and dry and dirty,
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.140]   and the oil brings them to softness and a healing
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:24.100]   and a restoration and new life, so the Meshiach,
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.540]   when they are anointed by God, they
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.900]   are used to bring healing and comfort and revival and life
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.460]   to the dry and cracked and weary people of the world.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.940]   And, oh, the stories that he would tell
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.660]   were just so wonderful to us.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.980]   It was our favorite time in the day.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:47.180]   And my dad, after a while, began to tell us a story
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:52.140]   about a coming Meshiach, not just an anointed one,
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.820]   but the anointed one, the one who would come and pour
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.900]   his oil, if you will, on all of humanity,
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.180]   the one who would come and set us all free,
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.460]   washing away our sin, restoring us in relationship
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.700]   with Yahweh, the one who would establish for all time
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:12.020]   a place of repentance and life and the fullness of everything.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.740]   And when my dad told the stories of a coming Meshiach,
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.500]   we would lean forward with joy in our hearts.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.740]   We could not wait.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:28.460]   But waiting seemed to be all we ever did.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.860]   In fact, my people have been waiting for years, generation
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.540]   after generation after generation,
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.260]   with the idea that this Meshiach, this Messiah in your tongue
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.740]   will come one day, and we're still waiting.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.660]   When I came of age, my father's stories
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.900]   didn't seem to hold the same vibrancy anymore.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.860]   It's interesting, isn't it, how a joy and a fantasy
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.140]   from childhood can become an adult's embarrassment
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.220]   when you get a bit older.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.460]   And I remember feeling to myself that this longed
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.420]   for hope of a coming Messiah was still such a long way away.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.820]   Should we really hold onto that hope?
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.260]   I mean, is this really an expectation we should have?
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.460]   I almost felt like my father had set me up
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.660]   to fail, that my father had put in me
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.820]   this desire for the coming together of all things
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:24.820]   under God once again, and it was never going to happen.
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.180]   The tension between me and my father grew.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:33.020]   I began to find his attitude, his constant hope,
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.780]   his constant talk about this coming Messiah,
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.340]   it just grated on me.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:44.860]   I felt like it was just air that had no substance anymore.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.660]   I wonder if you've ever felt a little bit like that.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.700]   When I came of age, my mother had a friend
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.620]   whose son was a shepherd, and he said
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.460]   he would be willing to take me as an apprentice under him,
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.620]   and I couldn't leave quick enough.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.220]   I gathered up my stuff, said goodbye to my family,
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.980]   and ever since then I've been a shepherd.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.700]   The shepherd has been a wonderful life for me.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.460]   I've been truly blessed with it.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.740]   I get to spend every single day, the majority of my time,
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:18.740]   outside in the beauty of the hills of the Judean wilderness.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.700]   I mean, if you haven't seen them,
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.900]   you should see them someday.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.180]   They are just glorious.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.180]   And people often think that shepherds are lonely.
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.300]   That's a bit of a misconception.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.140]   We're not lonely at all.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.980]   We actually travel in groups.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.540]   There's usually three or four of us
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.860]   with our flocks at any one time.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.820]   And my favorite time of the day
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.740]   is right towards the end of the day,
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.300]   right towards the night where we all sit around
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.140]   and we start a fire.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.500]   It can get pretty chilly in those Judean hills,
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.340]   and we sit around a fire together,
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.540]   and as we're talking around the fire,
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.300]   you'll never guess what happens.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.700]   The other men will always turn to me and say,
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.140]   "Tell us some of the stories your father told you.
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.580]   Tell us of the messiahs of the old
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.100]   and the longing we have for the messiah to come."
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.220]   And irony out of all ironies,
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.500]   the one who had ran away from the stories of his father
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.040]   has now become the one who tells the stories of his father
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.540]   to the others.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:18.380]   I tell them with the same vibrancy, the same joy,
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.820]   the same enthusiasm my father said,
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.460]   but it's shallow and hollow inside of me
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.780]   because I don't really believe a word of it.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.780]   The men hang off every word.
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.780]   I'm a great storyteller,
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.100]   but I still feel like I'm setting them up to fail.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:40.440]   And then one day, everything changed.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.740]   I remember the night well.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.960]   I remember it because it was like
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.300]   the blackest of all nights.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.940]   It was like a darkness had almost come across the land.
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.180]   It was like formless and a void.
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:57.020]   It almost felt to me a little bit like
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.380]   what our scriptures describe,
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.020]   right at the start of all things,
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.140]   the beginning of the world and the voidness and darkness
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.540]   that was hovering there in creation.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:11.580]   And then in the darkness, suddenly a glorious light.
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.640]   It was as if the whole sky lit up.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.340]   There was a shaft of light that shone down from the sky
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.660]   that came upon us as shepherds,
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.680]   and we were overwhelmed immediately.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.180]   I remember thinking to myself
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.340]   that I should be blinded by this light.
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.060]   It was that bright, but I wasn't blinded.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.020]   In fact, the opposite happened.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.980]   For the first time in my life, everything seemed clear.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.140]   I mean, I could almost see things
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.580]   like I had never seen them before,
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.060]   as if for the rest of my life before,
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.280]   my eyes had only been half open.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.180]   And then a being appeared.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.620]   I can't describe to you what this being was like.
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.640]   It wasn't human,
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:01.880]   but there was a sense of majesty and glory and honor to it.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.420]   And immediately we were terrified.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.740]   We fell onto the floor.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.300]   We were shaking uncontrollably.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.980]   And then a voice came to us.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.820]   And when this voice came,
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.700]   it was like the whole universe was saying this.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.280]   And for me personally,
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.040]   it wasn't like I was hearing the voice
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.380]   with my ears externally.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.260]   It was as if the voice was reverberating inside of me
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.860]   and almost coming out of me.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.020]   It said, "Do not be afraid, shepherds,
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:31.720]   for we bring you great news and a joy and a tiding to all,
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.180]   that today, this very day,
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.480]   your Savior, your Messiah has been born.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.060]   In the town of David,
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:43.100]   you will find a child wrapped up in clothes
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.780]   and lying in a manger."
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.940]   And almost as soon as those words had happened,
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.940]   suddenly a great heavenly hosts appeared before us,
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.620]   a choir of angels,
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.940]   and they sang a song, a holy song,
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.500]   glory to God in the highest.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.780]   And on earth,
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.780]   peace will rest on those upon whom His favor is.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:13.120]   And as soon as it happened, they were gone.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.900]   Silence was upon us.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.940]   And we, with our faces down on the soil,
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.260]   trembling as we were,
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.660]   no one made a noise,
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.740]   almost as if none of us wanted to break the sacredness
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.040]   with the ugliness of human words.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:39.600]   And then something happened
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.420]   that hadn't happened to me in years.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.540]   Tears came.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.540]   Tears just started to stream down my face.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.500]   First of all, they were tears of shame,
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.940]   tears of the many years
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.940]   that I had turned my back on my family,
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.880]   tears of the many years
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.780]   that I had ignored the promises of the prophets of old,
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:04.020]   tears where I had turned my back on my faith
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.140]   and not believed, not longed,
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.300]   not held the waiting in my heart,
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.360]   tears of shame for what I had done.
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:18.720]   But then the tears were warm and salty,
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.580]   the tears of forgiveness,
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.820]   the tears that only come when we know
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.540]   that we're no longer at enmity with God,
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.900]   that we're no longer separated from Him.
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.860]   I began to cry tears of joy,
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.780]   knowing that I am forgiven,
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.260]   knowing that because the Messiah has come,
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.460]   our longed-for wait was over,
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.960]   knowing that those that had been separated once before
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.980]   by sin from a holy and majestic God
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.860]   were now being brought back together again,
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.380]   two opposites becoming one whole.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.980]   I realized in that moment, peace was here,
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:02.220]   true peace, shalom like we had always wanted.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:06.100]   The desire was now here.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.360]   And in this child, in a manger,
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.040]   wrapped with cloth,
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:15.800]   was not just the idea of peace,
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.860]   not just the offer of peace,
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.120]   but in this one, it was peace.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:27.360]   Emmanuel, God with us,
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.940]   the incarnation, fully God, fully human,
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.460]   in the one entity, I mean, that's what peace is all about,
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.660]   opposing things, coming together
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.760]   to form a new perfect whole in Jesus.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.180]   We now see not just the idea of peace,
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.380]   but the person of peace,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:50.460]   stepping into the gap, meeting us in our brokenness,
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.580]   drawing us now into reconciled,
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.980]   restored relationship with God.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.980]   I was filled with peace.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:05.580]   We jumped up, left our sheep behind,
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.340]   ran to Bethlehem.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.540]   And when my eyes saw the child for the first time,
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.260]   I remember thinking to myself,
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.660]   if only my father was here,
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.300]   because his dream, his hope,
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.020]   had literally come.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.300]   And you need to know,
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.120]   just a week before your celebration of Christmas,
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.820]   that your hope, your dream, has also come.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.740]   You need to know that the same washing of my sins,
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:42.240]   those warm and salty tears that set me anew and afresh,
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.080]   the same washing has happened now for you.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.900]   You need to know that if you have ever felt
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.140]   at enmity with God, away from Him
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.860]   because of your sin and your brokenness,
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.020]   that you've been now drawn near
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:59.020]   because of the Mashiach, the Messiah has arrived.
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:03.460]   You need to know that just like for me,
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.100]   there is a song for the not so holy,
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:10.200]   of a future that is not so distant from us.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.600]   For the Lord has come.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:17.900]   Do not be afraid.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.300]   As you look towards this week,
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.680]   may you know the peace of Christ upon you
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.560]   like never before.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.380]   May you know that in that child,
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.520]   there is reconciliation, restoration,
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.300]   because God is not distant.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.140]   He is here.
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.080]   Would you pray with me?
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:38.920]   I wonder whether you'd stand.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.160]   I'd love to pray with you.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:47.920]   I'm gonna pray as Andrew, not as Shepherd, okay?
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:48.760]   Just so you know.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.720]   Let's pray.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.920]   Father, we are grateful,
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.000]   grateful for this moment of sacredness
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.640]   as we listen to the Christmas story of peace
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.240]   in a different way this morning.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:08.940]   Father, we're thankful that peace is not
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.000]   at the hands of the herds of this world.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.640]   We're grateful that peace is not won for us
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.720]   by might or force or violence.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:26.360]   We're grateful that peace is not the absence of conflict,
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.600]   but the presence of you, even amidst the conflict.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:35.680]   We're grateful, Lord, that the peace that we get to know,
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.800]   the one that truly restores our heart and our soul
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:43.360]   is a peace that you purchase on the cross,
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.680]   that your resurrection proves,
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.800]   and the descending of your Spirit seals in us,
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.560]   a peace to know that our sins are forgiven,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.760]   and that our lives will be made new.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.600]   Lord, I wanna pray for anyone here in this room
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.400]   who needs that message afresh today.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:07.180]   I wanna pray for these brothers and sisters, Lord,
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:10.080]   and those that are watching online right now,
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.440]   that they would know the power of your peace.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.400]   Lord, I pray that if there's anything that's going on
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.840]   in the lives of these people,
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.940]   in the lives of us as a community here at the Vine,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.060]   that is keeping us in a place of stress, anxiety, fear,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.300]   a place where we don't feel at peace.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.280]   Lord, we come to you this morning,
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.460]   and we ask for your presence again.
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:41.360]   Emmanuel, I pray that you would be with us,
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.400]   that you would draw near to those
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.240]   that do not feel at peace right now.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.920]   And Lord, I'm sure each one of us, we have relationships,
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.680]   we have things that feel tense and stressy at the moment.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:00.540]   Father, we just bring them to you now in prayer.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:06.880]   And we ask that you would come and carry our burdens with us,
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.160]   lighten our load,
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.900]   and that those of us whose tongues feel like
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.560]   they've been stilled within us
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.880]   would feel our tongues being loosened again.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.000]   Those of us that have walked away from relationships
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.840]   like the shepherd would at Christmas time realize
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.000]   that there's an invitation for restoration.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.680]   Father, would you come and bring peace on earth
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.080]   just as it is in heaven?
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.600]   And may it be for your glory.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.640]   And we thank you for this.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.760]   In Jesus' name, Emmanuel says.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.080]   We're gonna worship together one more carol,
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.640]   so let's join together in song.
