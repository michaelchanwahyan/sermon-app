1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
 In church as we've been sort of gathered together today and as we're kind of

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,780
 focusing in on this idea of a reckless love, an endless love that meets us in

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,760
 the midst of all that is going on in our lives. I'm reminded of those words in

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,040
 Ephesians 3 where Paul says that no height or depth, no width or length can

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,080
 ever separate us from this love that is in Christ Jesus. And as I was reflecting

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,720
 on that passage as we were singing together here in this room I was

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,440
 thinking about all these people that are watching online right now and you know

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,160
 it's impossible for us to understand what is going on in your life but I do

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,000
 know that the Holy Spirit understands and knows everything that's happening in

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,120
 every part of your life right now whether that's your family life, your

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,640
 work life, whether that's in relationships or friendships, whether it's

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,240
 just the fears that you're holding, the sin that you're grappling with and here's

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,360
 what I do know. I don't know what it is you're going through but I do know that

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,240
 nothing can separate you from the love of Jesus, that there is nothing, no

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,560
 obstacle, nothing that can be put in the way that would stop His love from

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,600
 penetrating into where your heart is right now in this moment. And I just

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,440
 felt like the Holy Spirit wanted to just lead this time, just almost to pause in

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,040
 this moment and just to allow that Spirit to minister love where it is

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,640
 needed most. And you all know what that is for you. Each one of us are carrying

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,400
 in this moment something of a place that's dark, a place that's separated, a

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,800
 place that feels distant, a place where our hurts reside, where those fears sit,

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,520
 where disappointment is there, where pain remains, where mourning and grief finds

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,480
 its place. We all have those bits of our lives in our hearts and it's there that

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,320
 I want to pray that the Holy Spirit by His power and God's pursuing endless

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,520
 love would come and meet you right now. To just cut through all of the other

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,480
 stuff and settle on that place in your life where you need His comfort, His

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,320
 encouragement, His word, His hope, His faith, His love for you. So I wonder if I

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,840
 can pray that for you wherever it is that you're watching this right now.

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,200
 Let's pray. Father we just stand together as a church, the vine here in Hong Kong

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,080
 for all the homes that are gathered around our city right now watching this,

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,080
 for those overseas in other countries that are tuning in. Lord we don't know

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,920
 what's going on in each other's lives. Maybe we see pockets or we get snippets

33
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,720
 of information but we don't truly understand what's happening in the

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,920
 depths of other people's lives. But we do know that there is all this stuff that

35
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,080
 is likely there because we know it because it's in our life. And so Father

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,400
 we peel back the layers, those filters that we place on the Instagram of our

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,480
 life. We pull those back right now and we invite your Spirit in that no height nor

38
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,000
 depth nor length or width could ever separate us from the love of Jesus. So

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,280
 Holy Spirit whatever that means for each person watching, for every person in this

40
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,480
 room, would you move by your Holy Spirit. We give you permission to come and heal

41
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,360
 and restore us in those places. Lord would you come and do what only you can

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,320
 do and that is meet us with your love. Your Word says that we are able to love

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,880
 because you first loved us. Lord I pray for anyone watching this that feels

44
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:42,240
 distant from your love right now. You are a pursuing God and you are here in this

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,520
 moment working powerfully not in a room but in this world. You called us to pray

46
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,160
 on earth as it is in heaven so we pray Lord for these people right now that you

47
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,160
 would meet them, fight for them, comfort them, heal and restore them. We pray that

48
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,440
 you would do this to your glory and for your glory. And across the world, across

49
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,440
 our city and across this room we pray this right now in the name of Jesus

50
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:20,960
 everyone says amen. Well church it's so great. Why don't you guys have a seat. I

51
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,320
 have real people in the room. I am so glad. Welcome guys. Great to have you guys

52
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,440
 with us. How's everyone doing? You okay? You're alive? You're surviving? Are you

53
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,080
 glad to be back? A little bit back? Isn't that nice? I'm so glad you guys are here

54
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,720
 and we're glad that you are tuning in wherever you're watching from right now.

55
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,600
 I want to open up a passage of Scripture for us today that really means something

56
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,560
 to me personally. It's a passage of Scripture I've been sitting with for a

57
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,120
 while. It's one that actually has meant a lot because of some of the things that

58
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,200
 I've been going through in the last sort of five to six months here in our city

59
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,440
 and in my own personal life. But it's also one that I think holds some keys in

60
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,960
 it for how I think God wants us to reemerge and gather back together as a

61
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,120
 church as we're planning to do that with our in-person services next Sunday. The

62
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,160
 question in my heart, my soul is how is it that we should gather? How do we come

63
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,600
 back together? And there's a little bit of that happening right now with you

64
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,720
 guys in this room and those that are still watching online. But how is it that

65
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,200
 we are by the Spirit of God to come back? What does in other words church now look

66
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,400
 like? I want to read this passage of Scripture and open up some things to us

67
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,720
 today. It's found in Mark chapter 2. I'm gonna read from verse 1.

68
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,240
 "A few days later when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people had heard

69
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,600
 that he had come home. So many gathered there that there was no room left in his

70
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,520
 house, not even one outside the door. And so Jesus then inside preached the word

71
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,960
 to them. Some men came bringing to him a paralytic carried by the four of them.

72
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,880
 Since they could not get into him towards where Jesus was because of the

73
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,040
 crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and after digging through it

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,280
 they lowered the mat of the paralyzed man that he was lying on towards Jesus.

75
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:28,320
 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.'"

76
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:36,920
 Alright, I want you to picture this scene. Imagine with me that you are

77
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,040
 somebody who lives in Capernaum in the first century and you've lived there all

78
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,320
 your life. Maybe you've lived there with your family your whole life. Now in those

79
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,560
 days in Capernaum, Capernaum was about a hundred and fifty families strong in the

80
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,840
 first century. So roughly about 1,500 people lived in this town, a pretty

81
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,840
 sizable town in this area of Galilee. And one person from this town, a man

82
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,440
 called Jesus, who you had heard of, had gone out from this town of Capernaum and

83
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,880
 started to do some stuff around all of Galilee and he had become famous in the

84
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,000
 whole of Galilee. And you living in Capernaum had heard stories about this

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,800
 famous member of your community. And he's gone out and you hear the stories of

86
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,200
 what he's done. He's become a rabbi. He's teaching people. You hear stories about

87
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,960
 how he's actually not just teaching people about the kingdom of God, but he's

88
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,800
 doing miracles. Like you've heard the stories about how he can command the

89
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,600
 waves, how he can multiply food to feed people. And you've heard about the deaf

90
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,480
 that now can hear and the blind that now can see. And you're amazed that this one

91
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,560
 from your own hometown is going out to do this. And guess what? You've also heard

92
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,840
 that some people are calling him potentially the Messiah, the Son of God,

93
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,160
 the one that we had longed to hear and to witness and see come to save Israel.

94
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,560
 Could Jesus from your hometown be actually the Messiah? And now he's come

95
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,280
 back home. And he's gathered in his house and he's invited everyone from the

96
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,360
 town to come and hear him speak. And there you are sat there watching Jesus

97
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,840
 speak in this room. Can you picture it? I mean you're packed in there shoulder to

98
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,960
 shoulder. This is pre-COVID times, okay? It is so packed in there that you can

99
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,480
 barely breathe and barely move. And everybody is sitting there leaning in,

100
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,320
 listening to Jesus. And you're wondering in Capernaum, in his hometown, will he do

101
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,680
 the same kind of miracles that you'd heard about in Galilee? And just as

102
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,560
 you're watching him and listening to him, you suddenly out of the blue hear

103
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:03,000
 another sound. It's like a rustling sound, a scratching sound. And you're beginning

104
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,840
 to wonder where's that coming from? And then suddenly out of nowhere dirt begins

105
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,600
 to fall from the roof onto the floor. And everybody's like, "What is going on?" And

106
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,360
 everybody looks up, Jesus included. And you can see that there's a small little

107
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,640
 hole in the roof. And there are these little fingers digging into that hole.

108
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,000
 And as they're digging more dirt is falling into the middle of the room. And

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,040
 there's a bit of a noise happening. And everybody's wondering. And the hole's

110
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,040
 getting bigger and bigger. And soon the hole is big enough that you can see four

111
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,440
 people's faces peering into the room. And they keep digging and they keep

112
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,520
 scratching. And everybody's still looking. And suddenly out of nowhere it seems

113
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,680
 like a sheet covers the hole. And the sheet starts to descend into the room.

114
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,000
 And you're all wondering what is going on? And when that sheet gets to about

115
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,680
 your eye height as you're sitting there, you notice that it's not a sheet at all.

116
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,080
 It's a stretcher. And there's a man lying on that stretcher. And he's paralyzed. And

117
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,600
 that stretcher gets lowered all the way down from the four guys in the roof with

118
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,400
 ropes just letting it down to Jesus's feet. And when the mat finally gets onto

119
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:23,720
 the ground with a thud, nobody says anything. There's silence in the room.

120
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:34,440
 Because you're wondering what is Jesus going to do next? And once every eye is

121
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,600
 fastened on Jesus and no one is daring to breathe, Jesus looks up at the hole in

122
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,760
 the roof. And there are the four guys peering in looking really nervous. And as

123
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,320
 you are looking at Jesus, look at the four men in the roof, you think you see a

124
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:02,240
 glint of admiration in his eyes. And with a smile on his face, Jesus turns back

125
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:12,120
 down to the paralytic and he says, "Sons, your sins are forgiven." And everybody in

126
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:20,840
 that room is wondering, "Who is this one who has the audacity to forgive sin?" Many

127
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,520
 in the room are amazed at his words. Some in the room are angry that he's claiming

128
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:33,920
 to have the ability to forgive others but you. You cast a little glance back up

129
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,560
 to that hole in the roof and the four faces peering in. And you find a bit of

130
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:49,000
 glint of admiration in your eye as well. Can you feel it? I would love to have

131
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,360
 been there in that moment. I mean, if you could transport me to any time in history,

132
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,240
 I want to be right there in that moment at the time when that stretcher comes

133
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,200
 down and all of that takes place. It blows my mind because this story

134
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,920
 represents for us something that Jesus does here that he doesn't do in any

135
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,720
 other gospel story. This is the only moment where Jesus decides to heal

136
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,320
 somebody not on the basis of that person's faith but on the basis of the

137
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,000
 four people on the roofs faith. Nowhere else in the Gospels does something as

138
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,640
 audacious and as crazy as that take place. That Jesus would see their faith.

139
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,440
 In verse 5, let me show you this in verse 5, it says this, "When Jesus

140
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,520
 saw their faith," the Greek means the four that are peering in from the roof.

141
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,440
 "When he saw their faith, he turns to the paralytic, forgives his sins, and then

142
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,120
 later on in the story actually heals him of his infirmity because of their faith."

143
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,880
 That blows my mind. And not only does it blow my mind, but it shakes my theology.

144
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:05,880
 Because I come from a tradition, the vine is in a tradition in the church that you

145
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,420
 could call charismatic Protestant evangelicalism. And in charismatic

146
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,800
 Protestant evangelicalism, we have often taught that actually our healing and

147
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,960
 transformation comes when we have a little bit of faith. That if we could

148
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,560
 just believe that Jesus might be able to heal us, then actually we might be able

149
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,400
 to experience and find some of that healing and transformation in our lives.

150
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,480
 And so it's been taught from the pulpits, it's been shared from the Bible

151
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,360
 studies, that as long as we have some faith, it can be small, if it's as small

152
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,280
 as a little mustard seed, God can move mountains. But if you want your healing

153
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,000
 and your transformation, if you want God to do something great in your life, you

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,720
 just have to have a little bit of faith. Can I have an amen?

155
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,160
 In this story, the man on the mat is not told to us to have had any faith at all.

156
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,880
 That Jesus heals because of the faith of a different group of people. And because

157
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,560
 of their faith, he decides to do something about the person on the mat.

158
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,960
 That blows my mind, shakes my theology, and invites me into this glorious idea

159
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:24,040
 that there is power in a group of people standing on behalf of somebody who is

160
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:31,320
 suffering or in need. I call this a community of faith. That there is

161
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,200
 something beautiful about a gathered group of people. This is why we wanted to

162
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,280
 invite 40 of you into this room today, because I can't preach a message like

163
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,880
 this to just a camera. Even though there's a great community of people

164
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,880
 watching right now online. Hi! I wanted to do it in a room with a group of people

165
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,080
 because this message is about what it means for us to be a community of faith.

166
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,280
 That we get the great privilege as Christians gathered together in a church

167
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:03,880
 by church. Don't think building, think gathered community of people. The four

168
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,400
 people on the roof on that day were ecclesia, church together. And they're

169
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,880
 letting this person down, and it's their faith that transforms the one who's on

170
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,320
 the mat. And that is such a beautiful reminder to us that when we gather as

171
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,920
 the body of Christ today, we should have the same expectation, the same community

172
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,640
 of faith amongst us. That if there is anybody in our community who's in need,

173
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:40,400
 then we can grab the ropes of faith and be a part of what it is to let

174
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:49,240
 that person down to the feet of Jesus. You see, there is something prophetic and

175
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,480
 powerful about a group of people that are gathered together, who get to stand

176
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,200
 in faith on behalf of the other. Something truly prophetic and powerful

177
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,840
 in that. And as we think about what it is for us to regather as Divine Church

178
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:10,520
 next Sunday, as we open up in-person services, I want us to come into that

179
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,520
 moment with the expectation and the mindset that says, "I get to be a part of

180
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:23,320
 something prophetic and powerful." That I get to come in and stand boldly in faith

181
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,520
 on behalf of the person standing next to me in this service that I don't even

182
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,240
 know. But it's okay that I don't know them because I know Jesus sometimes

183
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:44,720
 heals the other on the basis of the community's faith. Are you with me?

184
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,200
 I want to share two important lessons that we get from this story that I think are so

185
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,680
 important for us at The Vine in this time of our history. Here's the first one.

186
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,560
 This story teaches us something really important about what it is to serve the

187
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,320
 people around us. And as we think about regathering next Sunday, this has to be

188
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,640
 in the center of what we're thinking about. That we get to do church. And by

189
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,720
 doing church, what that means is that every single person is a contributor to

190
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,360
 the reality of the faith in that community. That no one is anonymous. No

191
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:26,360
 one is left out. No one can just come in, slip into a pew, and be there and slip

192
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,040
 out. That every single one of us has something important to contribute and

193
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,400
 add. See, the vision of the New Testament Church, of what church is like in the New

194
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,400
 Testament, is not one or two or a small group of paid professionals doing all of

195
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,400
 the ministry work on behalf of everybody else. It's not about those that hold a

196
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,560
 title "Pastor." Who are the ones who get to serve everybody else. No. The picture in

197
00:17:53,560 --> 00:18:00,040
 the New Testament is a community serving a community. It's one another serving one

198
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,640
 another. That's why I got you today to sit like this. You're facing into one

199
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,480
 another. Normally at The Vine, we get you all to face forwards like this, right?

200
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,760
 Where you're facing the one or two up on stage. Today, you're facing one another.

201
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,680
 Why? Because you're just like what it would have been like to be in that room

202
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,140
 in Capernaum in that moment. But also, you're prophetically signaling what it's

203
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:28,000
 like to go, "These are my community of faith." And we get to stand together like

204
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,520
 those four guys on the roof. And if there is anybody in need, Acts chapter 2, the

205
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,640
 early church, nobody was in need. Why? Because everybody contributed something

206
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,680
 towards those that needed it the most. And as we think about reopening at The

207
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,960
 Vine, we must have the mindset, "Is anybody in our community in need right

208
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,880
 now?" Because if they are, no matter how helpless they feel, no matter how hurt

209
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,600
 they might be, no matter how broken it is, no matter how on the stretcher, they are

210
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:04,080
 not alone. Because I'm on the roof. And I'm going to take up my responsibility

211
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:12,800
 and let down the ropes of faith and get that person to Jesus. See, if you are a

212
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:19,080
 part of The Vine, this is my expectation on you. That you would consider yourself

213
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,880
 a part of the community of faith. Now you get the opportunity, the privilege to

214
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,560
 partner with others in letting people down to the feet of Jesus. Imagine what

215
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:37,400
 it would be like if we regather next week with that mentality. That's a church

216
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:44,600
 I want to be a part of. Here's the challenge though. We know that that's

217
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:51,960
 what Christ calls us to, this beautiful community of faith. The challenge is, if I

218
00:19:51,960 --> 00:20:02,360
 put myself in that moment in Capernaum, would I have been on the roof? Hmm. I

219
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:09,000
 don't know about you, but if I had been in Capernaum on that day, I think I would

220
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,800
 have been sat there in a chair. And I would have been sat there in a chair

221
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,200
 leaning forward, wondering what Jesus was going to do. And I would have been a part

222
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,040
 of the crowd. And when I heard that rustling, I would have looked up at the

223
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,480
 sky and seen that hole in the roof. I would have seen the stretcher being laid

224
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,640
 down. I would seem to be in place at the feet of Jesus. I would have wondered

225
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,680
 whether Jesus was going to be angry, upset, or whether Jesus was going to

226
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,920
 react. I would have looked back up into the room. I would have seen those four

227
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:41,160
 faces. And I would have thought to myself, "Wow, what amazing faith they have." And I

228
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,320
 realized that when I think about that story, and I think about myself, I am

229
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,360
 incredibly convicted by the questions that that story asks of me. Here's the

230
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:59,320
 question. Am I someone who would dig a hole in the roof to get a friend to the

231
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:06,680
 feet of Jesus? Or am I merely a spectator of somebody else's great faith? When it

232
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:15,280
 comes to helping others, am I a passionate digger or a passive, distant

233
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:23,640
 observer? Come on, church. Think about it. If I had been there and I had heard some

234
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,800
 people talk about, "Hey, why don't we go up on the roof? And why don't we dig a

235
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,560
 hole? And whilst Jesus is speaking, we'll get a stretcher and we'll let this

236
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,440
 guy down. And we'll put him right at the feet of Jesus because Jesus could heal

237
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,080
 him." I would have been there going, "Hey, guys, guys, guys. Hey, I don't know if

238
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,400
 that's such a great idea. I mean, have you thought about it through? I mean, this

239
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,160
 is Jesus. We don't want to upset him. You know, he's here to teach all the people.

240
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,120
 We're going to make such a mess. This is his house. How are we going to pay to

241
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,320
 repair the hole? Look, there's policies about this sort of stuff. There's way too

242
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,360
 much risk. What if we do this? Health and safety is going to be on us if we make

243
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,080
 such a mess in this place. I am not going to get involved in this, guys. I just

244
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:10,840
 think it's a bad idea." I realize. Come on, church. I realize. I realize that the

245
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:21,720
 paralytic would not have wanted me for a friend. It's never been so dangerously

246
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:29,680
 easy to be a spectator than right now. And as we reopen next week, the danger is...

247
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:35,360
 Now, we can only have 30%, but the danger is we get 30% of spectators in this room.

248
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,400
 I don't want any spectators anymore. We are living in a time of Hong Kong's

249
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,760
 history where we can no longer afford to have spectators in the kingdom of God.

250
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,800
 We have such an important thing to be doing in the body of Christ in the next

251
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,880
 number of years in this city that we love. It is our time to realize that we

252
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,320
 need to be on the roof digging and not on a chair observing the power of God's

253
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,200
 kingdom. It's our time to think that if we are going to be making a difference

254
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,000
 as a church in such an important hour of Hong Kong's history, we need to be

255
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,480
 asking ourselves, "Are we going to be sitting in the room or digging on the

256
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,960
 roof?" That's the first thing we learned from this story. Here's the second thing.

257
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:30,440
 While there's absolutely no room for any spectators anymore, we also have to

258
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,320
 realize that sometimes we will be the guys on the roof, but also sometimes we'll

259
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,320
 be the person on the stretcher. One of the great things about church, about

260
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,920
 gathering together, about being the body of Christ, is that we need to recognize

261
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,720
 that there are seasons in our lives when we will be one or the other of those

262
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,680
 people. There's going to be seasons in your life where you're the people on the

263
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,720
 roof, where you are filled with the Spirit of God, where God is saying

264
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,080
 something to you. You feel alive. You've been reading your scriptures. You've been

265
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,960
 doing your personal spiritual devotions. You've been coming to the church and

266
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,720
 worshipping. You're feeling like the Holy Spirit is like a wind behind your back.

267
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,440
 And you know that you're filled with faith and hope and expectation on behalf

268
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,000
 of the other. And it's like you've got those ropes in your hand and you're

269
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,240
 letting down people in the church before the feet of Jesus. If you're in one of

270
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,400
 those seasons, here's my word for you, fan into flame what the Spirit of God is

271
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,840
 doing in your life. Like lean into that season. The church needs you. It needs the

272
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,420
 ones on the roof. It needs the ones digging holes and preparing the

273
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,920
 stretchers and letting the people down. And if that's you, then don't bury what

274
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,480
 it is that God's doing in you. Let it out. Like I said last week with the Easter

275
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,880
 Sunday sermon, right? Roll up your sleeves. Get your palette of paint and start

276
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:58,600
 making a difference on that canvas. This is your time. But there will be seasons

277
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,200
 where you will be overwhelmed. Where you'll struggle. Where you'll find things

278
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,400
 really hard. You'll be in mourning and pain. Where things will be going on that

279
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,280
 are really tough in your life. And you'll feel like you have absolutely nothing to

280
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,720
 give. You'll have seasons where you're on the stretcher. And if that's you right

281
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,200
 now, here's my word of encouragement to you. Don't fight the stretcher. See as

282
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,480
 Christians we often think that our only role is to be on the roof digging the

283
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,160
 holes. But the reality is sometimes life is hard. Just because we know Jesus

284
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,920
 doesn't mean we're guaranteed the perfect life. Sometimes things are

285
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,280
 difficult and hard and we have to weather the storms of life. And we've all

286
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,000
 experienced some of those storms lately haven't we? The problem is there's often

287
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,360
 a little space in the church to go, "I'm on the stretcher." And we think that we

288
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,080
 have to pretend that we're not on the stretcher. Or if we are on the stretcher

289
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,080
 our tendency is to think that we have to privatize that experience. In other words

290
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,560
 we don't want to let anybody in public, anybody in the church know that I'm

291
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,040
 really struggling right now. Imagine if the paralytic that day had said, "I don't

292
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,360
 want to bother Jesus in a public moment." Imagine if he said, "No, no, no. I just

293
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,740
 want to keep this private. I guess Jesus can heal me from a distance. It doesn't

294
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:24,520
 matter. I'm not gonna tell anyone about it." I'm just... The paralytic was willing to

295
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:30,200
 have his infirmity on display before everyone to see. Now that doesn't mean

296
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,680
 that we hang out our dirty laundry to everybody all the time. But it does mean

297
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,440
 that we have the courage to be honest about where we're at in our faith. That

298
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,920
 we're able to in the space that we've created because we are a community of

299
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,640
 faith. To recognize that when I'm on the stretcher I'm not gonna fight that

300
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,000
 stretcher equally. I'm not gonna allow the enemy to privatize my pain. But I'm

301
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,160
 actually gonna realize that the very hope that there is for me when I'm on

302
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,280
 that stretcher is that God has planted me in a church where there are still

303
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,280
 some people on the roof. And this story tells me that I have hope when I'm on

304
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,920
 the stretcher. That even if I haven't got a prayer, even if I don't know what to

305
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,760
 say, even if I feel like I can't even get to church on Sunday, I don't even want

306
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,640
 to do it. I've closed the curtains. I've cut myself away. That I know that there

307
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,480
 are faithful brothers and sisters where the wind of the Spirit is behind their

308
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,400
 back and they're praying and they're doing the work. And Jesus with a glint of

309
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:32,240
 admiration in his eyes sees their faith and heals me. Comforts me. Comes down and

310
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:41,040
 helps me in the midst of what I'm going through. We're either on the roof or we

311
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,360
 are on the stretcher. And part of the beauty of the community of faith is to

312
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:54,480
 recognize which and respond. So as we close I want to challenge you. Where is

313
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:02,240
 it that you find yourself in the story today? Be honest with yourself. Do you

314
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,560
 find yourself sitting as a spectator when it comes to the vine? When it comes

315
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,520
 to the kingdom of God? When it comes to your faith? Do you find yourself that

316
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:21,800
 distant observer of the kingdom of God? Or are you the one who's on the roof

317
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,920
 with those ropes of faith in your hand feeling the wind of the Spirit on your

318
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:33,040
 back, lowering people Jesus? Or are you the one on the stretcher today who

319
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,800
 realizes that you haven't got a lot to give but equally you have enough courage

320
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,480
 to make it public? If you're the one who's sitting on the chair, hear this

321
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,000
 today. It's time for you to wake up and get out of the shadows. I'm gonna say

322
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,240
 that again. If you're on the chair, if you're a spectator, if you're wanting to

323
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,600
 remain distant, if you want an anonymous Christian life, Hong Kong is not the

324
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,680
 place for that. Wake up and get out of the shadows. If you're the person on the

325
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,840
 roof today, I want to encourage you to stir up prayer in you. To stand as an

326
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,120
 intercessor in this house. To bring all the needs of this church, whether you

327
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,360
 know them or not, before the Holy Spirit and ask Him, "How can I be praying for my

328
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,560
 people, my community, the Vine Church in this time, in this hour? What does that

329
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:25,200
 look like?" Fan into flame if that's you on the roof. But if you're on the

330
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,000
 stretcher today, I want you to realize that it's okay to rest at the feet of

331
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,960
 Jesus. That you don't need to pretend to be someone that you're not. You don't

332
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,640
 need to stir up some fake faith in you. That it's actually okay to say that, "I'm

333
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,960
 not sure if I've got faith right now." Because you are a part of a group of

334
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,080
 people that do and that will and that will stand and will help you and walk

335
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,640
 with you and journey with you. Literally, just as we started the service today, I

336
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,920
 got a WhatsApp from one of our congregation members. His name's Mark

337
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,920
 Opustovic and his wife, Julie, has been struggling with cancer and this

338
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:07,040
 morning she was rushed in an emergency into the hospital. She's been struggling

339
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,880
 with pneumonia and she's fighting for her life right now. She's somebody who's

340
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,840
 on a stretcher and I wonder whether we in this room right now and those that

341
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,880
 are watching online right now, those that recognize you're on the roof, that we

342
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,080
 might rise up and pray for this family right now. Wouldn't that be great? So I wonder

343
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,800
 whether you guys would stand with me. And if you're at home, I want to encourage

344
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,680
 you just to lean into this prayer time as well. And I'm gonna pray for Julie and

345
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,800
 for Mark and then I'm gonna pray for the rest of us as we respond to the message

346
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,520
 today. Father, we just stand right now on behalf of this family. Lord, we pray for

347
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,120
 Julie who's literally on a stretcher right now. Who, Lord, has been rushed into

348
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,480
 the hospital as we've been doing this service. Who's a part of this community

349
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,920
 of faith, who's been a part of this community of faith for many years. Who's

350
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,920
 been in a cancer journey, is struggling with pneumonia right now. Lord, as the

351
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,760
 community of the Vine Church, we stand on the roof and we lower Julie before the

352
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,680
 feet of Jesus right now. And we pray in the name of Jesus, Lord, you would come

353
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,600
 and you would move and you would have your way over Julie, over Mark, that you

354
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,640
 would bring your spirit of rest, of redemption, of restoration, and of life

355
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,000
 for this family right now. Lord, we pray that you would be with the doctors and

356
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,280
 the nurses, those that are at work healing and restoring and redeeming her.

357
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,080
 We pray, Father, for calmness and peace over the wider family. And Lord, we stand

358
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,840
 as a community on behalf of Julie and Mark and we lift them before you right

359
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:48,600
 now in the name of Jesus. Just take a moment, Church, as you're watching this.

360
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,360
 Just take a moment now to think about yourself. Are you a spectator? Are you on

361
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,280
 the roof? Are you on the stretcher? If you're a spectator, it's time to move. If

362
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,680
 you're on the roof, it's time to pray. If you're on the stretcher, it's time to

363
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,760
 reach out in honesty this week and let somebody know and invite them to stand

364
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,360
 over you in faith. Let me pray for you. Lord, whatever it is, whichever of these

365
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,320
 three perspectives we are today, we come in this moment, Lord, as we prepare as a

366
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:28,440
 community of faith to reopen together next Sunday, as we prepare to be a church

367
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,480
 gathered together again. Lord, we want to do so off the back of the inspiration of

368
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,840
 Mark chapter 2. Lord, we want to be a caring community, a loving community, a

369
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,920
 community standing on behalf of the broken and the hurting and the vulnerable

370
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,600
 amongst us. Lord, we want to be an honest community that is able to put our hands

371
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,560
 up and say, "I'm on the stretcher today." Lord, we want to be a church of faith, Lord,

372
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,600
 standing on behalf of those that are struggling with their faith. We want to

373
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,080
 be a church, Lord, that has something to say to the issues of our city and our

374
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,120
 society in this time. Lord, we want to be active, the people of the resurrection,

375
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:14,960
 Father. And so we pray, Lord, wherever it is, for the spectators, I pray, that your

376
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,160
 Spirit would challenge them to rise up. Lord, for those on the roof, I pray that

377
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,040
 you would give them an innocessor anointing in this hour and in this time.

378
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:30,480
 For those on the stretcher, Lord, I pray release of rest over them, to not try to

379
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,840
 be something they're not, but to rest in the hope that is found being embedded in

380
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,880
 the community of faith. Lord, we thank you for this. We release it over us. We pray

381
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,720
 this in Jesus' Name. Everyone says.
