00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
 O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:25,120
 Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,320
 Leave behind your regrets and mistakes.

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,480
 Come today, there's no reason to wait.

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,600
 Jesus is calling.

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,320
 Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,800
 From the ashes a new life is born.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,120
 Jesus is calling.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:02,720
 O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:12,320
 Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:21,840
 O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:33,520
 Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

13
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:52,640
 Oh what a Savior, oh what a Savior.

14
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,360
 Isn't he wonderful?

15
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:06,960
 Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen.

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:16,400
 Bow down before him, for he is Lord of all.

17
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,040
 Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen.

18
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,760
 Thank you Lord.

19
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:35,120
 Oh what a Savior, isn't he wonderful?

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:44,160
 Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen.

21
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:53,680
 Bow down before him, for he is Lord of all.

22
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,880
 Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen.

23
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:14,000
 O come, O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,440
 Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

25
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:32,720
 O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.

26
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:42,160
 Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

27
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:51,760
 O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide.

28
00:03:51,760 --> 00:04:02,640
 Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

29
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,560
 Bear your cross as you wait for the crown.

30
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,480
 Tell the world of the treasure you found.

00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:32,480

33
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,800
 Who makes the sun to rise?

34
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,560
 Who makes the sun to rise and brings the earth new life?

35
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:19,040
 In every beam, Jesus it is you.

36
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:26,960
 Who turns the day to night and watches me as I begin to dream?

37
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,960
 Jesus, it is you.

38
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,840
 Who brings me food for my table?

39
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,560
 Who cares for all of my needs?

40
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,320
 Who walks the road with me, has grown with me through all that I have been?

41
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,600
 Jesus, it is you.

42
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,760
 Jesus, it is you.

43
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:11,440
 Oh, so I lift my hands.

44
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,160
 I bring my song.

45
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:31,200
 All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.

46
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:45,440
 I offer my life here and beyond.

47
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:57,280
 To the one thing true, Jesus, it is you.

48
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:07,280
 [MUSIC]

49
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,840
 Who sees my brokenness?

50
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,760
 Who sees my brokenness and carries me when I am frail and weak?

51
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,680
 Jesus, it is you.

52
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:31,440
 Who tells the storm to rest when I am overwhelmed and cannot speak?

53
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,200
 Jesus, it is you.

54
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,760
 Who wears my guilt on his shoulders?

55
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,480
 Who holds my heart in his hands?

56
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:58,000
 Who takes my thoughts and fears and hangs them on the arms of cavalry?

57
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,280
 Jesus, it is you.

58
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,360
 Jesus, it is you.

59
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:14,960
 Oh, so I lift my hands.

60
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,600
 I bring my song.

61
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:34,400
 All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.

62
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:48,560
 I offer my life here and beyond.

63
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:57,520
 To the one thing true, Jesus, it is you.

64
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,320
 We lift our voice.

65
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:07,120
 So I lift my hands.

66
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,760
 I bring my song.

67
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:26,240
 All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.

68
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:40,240
 I offer my life here and beyond.

69
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:51,440
 To the one thing true, Jesus, it is you.

70
00:09:51,440 --> 00:10:06,320
 To the one thing true, Jesus, it is you.

71
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:18,320
 To the one thing true, Jesus, it is you.

72
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:30,960
 Before Jesus went to the cross, which is something we remembered, we also celebrated

73
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,480
 his resurrection last week, but before he did that, he set up a meal.

74
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:44,720
 A meal, it's something that can draw people around the table like this one here.

75
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,040
 So what we do here once a month, the communion, it's not meant to be individual.

76
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,400
 It's meant to be something that we do in a community.

77
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,720
 It meant to, we're meant to do this with someone together.

78
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,000
 We're drawn to a table together to share a meal together.

79
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,320
 So yes, the meal here, the bread and the wine, it represents Jesus' body and his blood.

80
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,920
 It's still, we're still pointing towards God, towards Jesus, but we're meant to come together.

81
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:26,440
 And so as a welcome team, they're distributing the bread and the cups right now.

82
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,480
 I want you to do this.

83
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,640
 If you've received your bread and your cup, why don't you turn around to the ones around

84
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,960
 you and just say, "Hey, how can I pray for you this week?

85
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,080
 How, what are you going through?"

86
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,680
 You can be short, you don't have to tell, you know, we're not taking like forever, but

87
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,400
 just quickly like, "Hey, how can I pray for you?"

88
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,720
 Or even if you haven't received the bread right now, right where you are, why don't

89
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,640
 you just turn to the person next to you and ask, "How can I pray for you this week?

90
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:02,040
 How can I, when we come to Jesus together, how can I talk to Jesus about you this week?

91
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,600
 What's your need?

92
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,360
 How can I support you as your church family?

93
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,360
 How can I come alongside you?"

94
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,360
 Amen.

95
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:27,360
 Amen.

96
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,360
 Amen.

97
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,360
 Amen.

98
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,360
 Amen.

99
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:55,360
 Amen.

100
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:05,000
 And together as a community, together as a family, we gather around a table and together

101
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,360
 we partake in this communion.

102
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,720
 So if you've bread in your hand, I invite you church, let's partake in the bread.

103
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:27,240
 Let's take it together right now.

104
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,080
 If you're praying for each other, I do want to give you time to finish that.

105
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,520
 I can quickly wrap up.

106
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
 It's beautiful.

107
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,880
 We're meant to do this together, church.

108
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,040
 I'm so proud of you.

109
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,240
 I'm so proud of our community.

110
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,960
 And whatever their needs are, we know that we have the answer in Jesus.

111
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,320
 So Jesus says, "This is my blood.

112
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,000
 I've make a new covenant with you."

113
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:11,520
 And so together church, let's take the cup.

114
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,840
 Let me pray for us.

115
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,560
 Jesus together as one family, we come before you that we know we don't do this alone.

116
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,520
 We don't take this communion alone, but we do it with the people around us.

117
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,160
 And so God, I'm here.

118
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
 Yes.

119
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
 We're here to focus.

120
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,840
 We're here to worship you.

121
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,880
 Jesus, it is you.

122
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,120
 It's all about you, but it's also about those around us.

123
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,920
 God, so the needs of those around me, it concerns me today, Lord.

124
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,400
 We bring these needs towards you, to you as one family today.

125
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,840
 We pray for each other.

126
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,720
 God, may your will be done.

127
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,420
 May your kingdom come.

128
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,080
 But I also pray that you would bless those who are around us right in this room.

129
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,560
 Help us so that we would learn to be a family together.

130
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:12,560
 In Jesus name I pray.

131
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:19,880
 Shout Jesus from the mountains and Jesus in the streets.

132
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:26,200

00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,920
 Let's do it again.

 I just want to speak the name of Jesus over fear and all anxiety.

 To every soul held captive by depression, I speak Jesus.

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,520
 Sing it over your neighbor.

 Shout Jesus from the mountains and Jesus in the streets.

176
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,160
 Jesus in the darkness over every enemy.

177
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,960
 Jesus for my family, I speak the holy name.

178
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,600
 Jesus, your name is power.

179
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,520
 Your name is power.

180
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,520
 Your name is healing.

181
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,680
 Your name is life.

182
00:20:52,680 --> 00:21:08,520
 Break every stronghold, shine through the shadows, burn like a fire.

183
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,920
 Sweet, declare your name over every stronghold, over every darkness.

184
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:21,000
 In our lives, in our families, in our city, God we just lift you up in this place, Lord.

185
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,120
 We believe there is power in your name.

186
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,160
 We believe that you will bring healing and salvation.

187
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,880
 You will bring your light into the darkness.

188
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,400
 So God, we're here to worship you as your church.

189
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,960
 We're here to believe.

190
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,160
 We're not to believe the darkness that we see around, but we are to believe the light

191
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,000
 that we find in you.

192
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,960
 And we believe that you want to bring this light to this city, especially you want to

193
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,640
 do it through us, your followers, your people.

194
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,960
 And so God, I praise you, Lord.

195
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,040
 We worship you, Lord.

196
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:02,680
 We were here to intercede, to pray for our city, to pray for our households.

197
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,960
 We're here to pray for those around us, just like what we did minutes ago.

198
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:14,000
 Father, we pray that today through how we pray, how we intercede, we want to minister

199
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,200
 your light, your presence into those around us.

200
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,720
 Father, we pray that we'll continue to focus on you.

201
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,440
 We'll continue to fix our eyes on you so that we don't forget, yes, there is darkness outside.

202
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,880
 There are challenges everywhere, but you are here and you're here to bring light and life

203
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,000
 to this world.

204
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,720
 And so Jesus, we thank you.

205
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,020
 I thank you for your love.

206
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,320
 Thank you for your presence in this place here today.

207
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,900
 Thank you for dying for us and also for rising from the dead for us as well so that we could

208
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:54,880
 experience that resurrection power, that we could be the resurrection people on this planet.

209
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
 Thank you, Jesus.

210
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,600
 We praise you.

211
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
 We worship you.

212
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
 And in Jesus name we pray.

 Amen.

214
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600

215
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,000
 Let's give a shout to Jesus.

216
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Hallelujah.

217
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,160
 Amen.

219
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,200
 Love you guys.

220
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:23,760
 Please be seated everyone.

221
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,800
 How are you all doing?

222
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,480
 I could feel that excitement from our kids.

223
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,800
 Oh, that's so good.

224
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,760
 Just want to say hello to everyone.

225
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,820
 My name is Chapman.

226
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,880
 I am one of the pastors here.

227
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,720
 Welcome to Divine Yuen Long.

228
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,040
 Hopefully if this is your first time visiting, you want to get to know us a little bit or

229
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,000
 maybe your friends told you about us, you're here to just check it out and see.

230
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,760
 We just want to extend a very warm welcome to you.

231
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,120
 And if you're here for the very first time, could you let us know where we are?

232
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,320
 We just want to say hi to you.

233
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
 Hi.

234
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,720
 Thank you for coming.

235
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
 Yes.

236
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,680
 Thank you so much.

237
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,440
 If you want to get to know more about us or if you haven't done so in the last couple

238
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,840
 of weeks, we have a new WhatsApp channel.

239
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,940
 We are replacing the old with the new one.

240
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,920
 If you haven't been with us for the last couple of weeks, haven't scanned that yet, you have

241
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,880
 three more seconds to do this.

242
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,880
 Or if they put it there, you can continue to scan.

243
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,520
 But right now we're going to pray for our children.

244
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
 Can you sense the excitement?

245
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
 Oh, great.

246
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,200
 They're going to experience Jesus today.

247
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
 All right.

248
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,800
 So why don't we stretch our hands to what's the kids we're going to pray for them.

249
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:40,240
 Father, we just pray that you will meet all our children today in the K through C classroom.

250
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
 You speak to them.

251
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,160
 Your love, God, I just pray it will fall tangibly on them.

252
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,400
 Lord, I just pray they would learn about you, learn about your word, and that they will

253
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,040
 experience your presence even in those rooms.

254
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
 In Jesus' name I pray.

255
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
 Amen.

256
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,360
 Yes, they are too excited.

257
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,640
 So let's bring them to K through C right now.

258
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,680
 Teacher June is over there.

259
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,440
 So kids, you can go to June over there.

260
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,760
 She's waiting for you.

261
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,600
 And if you have kids under the age of two, we have a playroom at the back.

262
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,120
 You can be with your kid inside and there's a TV.

263
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,360
 We're streaming the service live inside.

264
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
 All right.

265
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,040
 So you have, I assume you guys talk a little bit about like how you can pray for each other

266
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
 just now.

267
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,780
 I'll give you another two minutes.

268
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:34,820
 Why don't we just briefly share a little bit about a week, what you've done over holiday,

269
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,960
 just you know, chit chat a little bit, get to know each other.

270
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
 I'll be back in a minute.

271
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
 Living in the present, not what it should have occurred.

272
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
 I remember back when I was low as a rug.

273
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
 Now I'm standing up, look at what my father does.

274
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
 Turning all things blue, gray skies blue.

275
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
 Hear the church say, "And won't he do it?"

276
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
 I know he's got my back.

277
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
 That's why I'm singing that.

278
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
 I know he's got my back.

279
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960

00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
 I know he's got my back.

351
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
 I know he's got my back.

352
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
 I know he's got my back.

357
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
 I know he's got my back.

358
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
 I know he's got my back.

359
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
 I know he's got my back.

360
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
 I know he's got my back.

361
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
 I know he's got my back.

362
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
 I know he's got my back.

363
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
 I know he's got my back.

364
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
 I know he's got my back.

365
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
 I know he's got my back.

366
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
 I know he's got my back.

367
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
 I know he's got my back.

368
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
 I know he's got my back.

369
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
 I know he's got my back.

370
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
 I know he's got my back.

371
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
 I know he's got my back.

372
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
 I know he's got my back.

373
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
 I know he's got my back.

374
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,400
 - Everybody, you've prayed before.

375
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,600
 How many times you've prayed before?

376
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,880
 We want to invite you to a prayer meeting.

377
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,120
 You don't have to be an expert in prayer to attend a prayer meeting.

378
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,160
 You just have to be you and come along and join us.

379
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,520
 So the next prayer meeting, it's on the 16th of April.

380
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,260
 It's next Tuesday.

381
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
 Not this one.

382
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,260
 Next Tuesday.

383
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,260
 Kids that way.

384
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,160
 And it rhymes.

385
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
 Okay.

386
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,020
 So we start at eight, so come after dinner.

387
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,960
 We love to see you there.

388
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,440
 And then we have another announcement.

389
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,200
 If you have any young people around you in your family, young meaning, like I know you

390
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,000
 look at me, you think I'm young.

391
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,600
 Anyway, you have any teenagers at home or around you, you know, we have a good news

392
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
 to bring to you.

393
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,360
 A couple of weeks ago at our vision Sunday, you've heard Pastor Tim talked about our heart

394
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,180
 to start a youth ministry, start a youth group here.

395
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,080
 And we're taking the next step right now.

396
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,420
 So can we have the slides behind me?

397
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:23,440
 If you are interested, like, I mean, as families, if you have teenagers at home, or if you're

398
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:30,280
 a teacher or you work with young people, said, I want to bring them to Jesus, you could,

399
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
 this is happening.

400
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,440
 I mean, happening by happening.

401
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,480
 I mean, we're preparing for that to start.

402
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,000
 So if you're interested, you want to know more information today after the service and

403
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,120
 next week after the service, you can come to me right after the service.

404
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,760
 We'll have a chat over that corner.

405
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,040
 So if you have kids, you know anyone who have kids, come have a chat with me.

406
00:28:53,040 --> 00:29:00,120
 I would love to learn more about your teenagers at home or the teenagers that around you.

407
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
 All right.

408
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,600
 So come to me if you have any teenagers around you.

409
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,400
 Or if you said, hey, Chapman, if there's a youth ministry, there's a youth group, I would

410
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
 love to serve.

411
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,160
 I would love to be a youth leader.

412
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,920
 I know there's someone right here.

413
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
 You're thinking about that.

414
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,200
 So you need to scan this QR code also.

415
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,600
 So this is for if you're interested in volunteering, we're going to have a youth group volunteer

416
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,960
 info session in two weeks time, April 21st.

417
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,200
 I will do it after lunch, 2.30 to 3.30.

418
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
 So interested.

419
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
 I need to see more cameras right now.

420
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
 I'm just joking.

421
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
 But yeah.

422
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
 All right.

423
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,420
 But if you know someone, they will be great, you know, with teenagers, you can encourage

424
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,840
 them to sign up or just encourage them to not to sign up to serve right away, but sign

425
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,440
 up, come here to learn more about it.

426
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,280
 Is that okay?

427
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,200
 And even if you're not scanning any QR code, can I still invite you to stretch out your

428
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,040
 hands and, you know, pray, pray for the next generation.

429
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,800
 We need more people to pray for our next generation.

430
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
 Amen.

431
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 Amen.

432
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
 We're here.

433
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 We're standing here for them.

434
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
 All right.

435
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
 One last thing.

436
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,760
 Who likes coffee here?

437
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,600
 All right.

438
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,080
 That's less than I expected.

439
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,040
 That's great because we can get all the coffee.

440
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
 Not anyway.

441
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,600
 No, we love you.

442
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,040
 We do have a new coffee machine.

443
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,280
 Someone very kindly donated a new coffee machine to us.

444
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,920
 Is that exciting?

445
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
 Yes.

446
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,400
 And we want to make good use of it.

447
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,960
 We want to steward this resources that God has so graciously given us.

448
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,840
 So we do have a coffee team right now.

449
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,920
 They're serving.

450
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,460
 So they will serve before service.

451
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,640
 If you come to the English service, they will be serving, you know, before the service until

452
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,040
 1125.

453
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,240
 So five minutes before service, we're just going to stop.

454
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,080
 But after service, we'll be serving coffee again.

455
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,200
 So if you like coffee, you know where to go.

456
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,600
 Do say thank you to the coffee team.

457
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
 They're serving.

458
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,100
 They're great.

459
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,080
 And there's a suggested donation as well.

460
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,320
 There's a cost.

461
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,920
 Every cup of coffee, we're suggesting if you could donate $30, that would help us continue

462
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,200
 to run, to serve, and to bring coffee to more people.

463
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,960
 So that's it.

464
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,600
 Did I miss anything about the coffee?

465
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
 No.

466
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
 All right.

467
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,360
 And now talking about like this donation, talking about, you know, how God is providing,

468
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,760
 we do also want to talk about a way that we can continue to worship, which is through

469
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,800
 our tithes and offering.

470
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,880
 We can welcome team.

471
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,080
 Feel free to pass out the buckets right now.

472
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:41,400
 If you prefer to give by cash or checks or whatever, like the paper way, we have our

473
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,880
 buckets passing around right now.

474
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,960
 Or if you are the digital generation, you use your phone for every single thing, all

475
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,280
 the QR codes are there behind me.

476
00:31:53,280 --> 00:32:01,000
 I love the fact that God, you know, moved someone and he donated a coffee machine to

477
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 us.

478
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 I think that's awesome.

479
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,960
 So this is a beautiful picture of offering.

480
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,240
 And as a church, we have to learn how to steward these resources.

481
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,160
 And the same, it's true of what we're doing here right now.

482
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,200
 We thank you for your generosity.

483
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,600
 I believe God is speaking to you how he wants you to give.

484
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,440
 At the same time, we also have a role, how we're going to steward all these resources.

485
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,680
 You can do it by joining in a ministry.

486
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,700
 You can do it by serving alongside us.

487
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,080
 You can do it by continuing to faithfully give.

488
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:39,240
 You can do it by finding out more how you can, you know, steward all these resources

489
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,160
 by, you know, scanning that QR code and coming to Youth Ministry.

490
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,640
 Okay, anyway, I'm going to stop here.

491
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,680
 Let's pray.

492
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:52,200
 Father, we celebrate the fact that you are a generous God.

493
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,760
 We thank you for the generosity that we experience in our lives.

494
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,320
 And we thank you for the opportunity when you allow us to be generous so that we could

495
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,060
 experience your heart even more.

496
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,640
 So God, we just pray for the offering today.

497
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,280
 We pray that these resources will be put in great use.

498
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,680
 We pray that these resources will bless those around us in this community, in this city.

499
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,360
 In Jesus' name we pray.

500
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,360
 Amen.

501
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,480
 All right, right now I'm going to invite a speaker today up here, Pastor Tim.

502
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,000
 Can we put our hands together for Pastor Tim?

503
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,640
 So great to have him back, right?

504
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,280
 If you didn't notice, he was gone for a while for holiday.

505
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,520
 So you know, see, he's so fresh.

506
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
 He looks fresh.

507
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
 Look at me.

508
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,800
 No, I'm okay as well.

509
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,760
 But let's stretch out our hands and pray for Pastor Tim.

510
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,960
 Father, we thank you for Tim, for his heart.

511
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,800
 He's such a pastor that he cares for people, that he loves to speak into our lives.

512
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,920
 And God, I know this is what he has prepared to do today.

513
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,640
 He is here to speak right into our hearts.

514
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,480
 He is here to bring your word.

515
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,600
 So God, we receive your servant.

516
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,240
 We also receive the word that he's going to bring to us.

517
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,800
 We open our hearts to you and to him who's going to bring us the word.

518
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,200
 In Jesus' name we pray.

519
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
 Amen.

520
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
 Amen.

521
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
 Thank you, Chapman.

522
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,560
 He always looks fresh.

523
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:28,720
 Hey, today we're starting a new sermon series and we've titled the sermon series, Longing

524
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
 for Healing.

525
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,800
 Now, I don't know if you've ever longed for healing.

526
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,440
 I certainly have.

527
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,040
 So I think this is going to be very significant for us.

528
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,880
 And so what we're going to do is we're going to look at Jesus and how it is in Jesus that

529
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,800
 we can find help, hope, healing, and wholeness.

530
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,760
 Now what's interesting is when we look at the gospel and the encounters of Jesus with

531
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:03,440
 people, a lot of times people bring the obvious thing, the obvious need for healing to Jesus.

532
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,120
 Maybe it's the physical healing.

533
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,360
 Maybe it's the demon that needs to be driven out.

534
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,040
 And in Jesus, you know, he heals.

535
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,480
 He loves doing that.

536
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,880
 But it doesn't just stop there.

537
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,320
 If we pay close attention, we can see that Jesus many times does a more holistic and

538
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,280
 a deeper healing in that person's life.

539
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,000
 A lot of times there's emotional healing.

540
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,840
 There's social healing, bringing people back into community that were in isolation.

541
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,400
 And so what we're going to do in this sermon series, we're going to look at these different

542
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,800
 ways that Jesus brings this healing to us.

543
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,240
 And we're going to look at what that means for us personally and how we can experience

544
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,200
 Jesus bring healing into our lives.

545
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,480
 Now I want to share with you the little bit of overview of where we're going to head.

546
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,920
 So we have seven weeks planned.

547
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,080
 I'm not going to talk through every title today.

548
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,280
 Our topic is "No Other Name."

549
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,160
 And so we're going to look at that in a little bit.

550
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,560
 But my heart for the sermon series is that we see that Jesus is healing.

551
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,960
 It's not just back then, but that Jesus wants to release and bring a ceiling to us here

552
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
 now.

553
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,600
 You know, he has the power to step in the areas where there's brokenness, where there's

554
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:36,000
 pain, where there's suffering, and to meet us in that, to provide the grace that we need,

555
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,160
 to maybe move forward, to provide the strength, to provide healing.

556
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,560
 So Jesus meets us in different ways, but he does meet us.

557
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,800
 And so that's what we're going to be doing in the sermon series.

558
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,480
 Now some of us here might be sitting here and you're like, "Well, Tim, that is great.

559
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,360
 But I'm actually feeling good.

560
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,240
 I'm actually feeling fantastic."

561
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,840
 Well, that's awesome.

562
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,440
 Praise God.

563
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,240
 And I genuinely mean that.

564
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,240
 Praise God that you are feeling awesome, that there's nothing obvious right now in your

565
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:24,040
 life that needs Jesus to meet you, to bring healing, and to touch your life.

566
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,760
 But I do want to challenge you with this.

567
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:35,600
 You know, as Christians, part of our discipleship journey is an ongoing healing journey.

568
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,320
 It's actually for every Christian.

569
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,280
 And the Bible talks about salvation in three different ways.

570
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,400
 I was saved, I am being saved, and I will be saved.

571
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,080
 So there's a past, a present, and a future way that scripture talks about this.

572
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:04,640
 So that means that even if we are Christians, we are still in the process of being made

573
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,960
 whole.

574
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,360
 Jesus is still at work in us.

575
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,200
 He's not finished with us.

576
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,040
 There's still things to be done.

577
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:17,280
 There's still areas where we need healing in our lives, where we need restoration, where

578
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,180
 we need wholeness, where we need to be well.

579
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:33,680
 And so I want to challenge you to be open to this holistic healing work of Jesus.

580
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:40,520
 And I want to encourage you to actually pray a prayer, to ask the Holy Spirit to reveal

581
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:48,560
 to you where He wants to do some healing and restoring work in your life.

582
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,520
 Maybe it's in your character.

583
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,960
 Maybe it's part of your history.

584
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,680
 Maybe there's a breakup that has just been painful and you're just hung up on and you're

585
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,080
 not able to move forward.

586
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,520
 Whatever it may be, but I want to encourage you to ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to you

587
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,620
 where He wants to do some healing work in your life.

588
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,360
 And whatever the Holy Spirit surfaces, it's always good.

589
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,320
 It's His timing.

590
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,840
 And we can, even though maybe it's not always easy when we go through a healing process,

591
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:29,280
 but He's gentle with us and He will lead us through to a better place to bring wholeness

592
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
 into our lives.

593
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:36,320
 So I actually want to encourage us right now to take just 30 seconds or a minute, just

594
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,240
 pray this prayer as we set off on this sermon series.

595
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,360
 So let's do that right now.

596
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,360
 Just you on your own.

597
00:39:44,360 --> 00:40:13,160
 Yes, Holy Spirit, we, you know, every one of our lives, you know everything about us.

598
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:20,200
 The things that are well and that are awesome and that are good, but also where we're carrying

599
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:26,480
 shame and carrying brokenness and, or just hurt from the past that we can't even name.

600
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,840
 And Lord, we thank you that you are a healer, that you are rescued, that you are a savior.

601
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:39,960
 And we ask that in this time, as you heard the prayers, as we just open our hearts and

602
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,880
 our lives to you, that you do your beautiful and healing work in us as a community.

603
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,200
 Now also thank you that you've given us each other to journey with each other in this,

604
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,280
 that we're not alone in that.

605
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,280
 I pray this in your name, Jesus.

606
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,840
 Amen.

607
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:05,400
 Now today our message is no other name.

608
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,480
 End of 2023, I was feeling pain that was keeping me up at night.

609
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,560
 So I'm laying in bed.

610
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,560
 I can't sleep.

611
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,360
 I don't, I don't know if you've had this where you shift around and it doesn't matter how

612
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,680
 you lay, you're still not feeling good.

613
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,120
 So after a few nights like that, I was like, I think I need to go to the doctor.

614
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,360
 So I go to the GP, he asked me diagnostic questions.

615
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,320
 And then he concludes, he tells me, well, I believe you have something that is quite

616
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,080
 common among older men.

617
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:40,760
 I was like, thank you for letting me know that I'm getting older.

618
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,000
 So he ended up giving me antibiotics.

619
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,480
 I take them, I feel better.

620
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,120
 I think everything's okay.

621
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,120
 A month later, this pain comes back again, but this time a little bit worse.

622
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,360
 So I go to the specialist, they do CT scan, blood work.

623
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,640
 Again I get antibiotics, which seems to be the solution for everything.

624
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,040
 And I've started feeling better.

625
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,480
 But this time, literally just for a week, and then I take a turn for the worse.

626
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,600
 I'm in pain sitting, I'm in pain standing, I'm in pain laying.

627
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,480
 Doesn't matter, basically doesn't matter what I do, I'm in pain and not feeling good.

628
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:26,720
 Now a friend of mine who is knowledgeable about what the diagnosis was, so he encouraged

629
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,720
 me to walk.

630
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,120
 He's like, maybe if you walk, it will feel better.

631
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,600
 It's like walking, really?

632
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,000
 Is that really going to help?

633
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,960
 I was skeptical, I was like, yeah, I'll give it a try.

634
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,760
 So I go out for a walk.

635
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,920
 Now, one thing you might not know is I actually like walking.

636
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,540
 So a lot of times I go for an hour walk trying to be healthy or healthier, I should say.

637
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:50,200
 So I started walking, I mean, I can hardly walk.

638
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,540
 And after a few hundred meters, I was like, something is wrong, something's not right.

639
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,160
 So I go home to my wife, Chris.

640
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,880
 I tell her I need to go to the A&E room.

641
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:08,740
 Now I don't know if you've ever been in a place where you experience just pain, whether

642
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:13,880
 it's physical pain or emotional pain, where you're just longing, you're just longing to

643
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
 be well.

644
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,560
 I just want to be well, I don't want to feel this pain anymore, I want to be able to sleep,

645
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,960
 I want to be able to sit.

646
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,200
 I couldn't even tie my shoes, I couldn't even bend over to tie my shoes.

647
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,000
 I don't want to ask my wife to tie my shoes, Lord.

648
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,320
 So that's the place I was in.

649
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,880
 So I went to the A&E room, to make a long story short, they end up admitting me to the

650
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,640
 hospital, they do surgery, there was an immediate relief, and I'm actually still recovering

651
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,980
 right now.

652
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,840
 So recovering with a wound from the surgery, so that takes a while.

653
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,320
 But I know I'm not alone in this.

654
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,680
 That we all at one point or another, we long for healing.

655
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,360
 For me it was longing for physical healing.

656
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:03,080
 For you maybe it's emotional healing, mental healing, spiritual healing.

657
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:08,000
 Maybe we know we're not right with Jesus, and for whatever reason we just struggle to

658
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,240
 be in the right place with Jesus, and we just long for spiritual healing.

659
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:21,440
 And that sometimes we find ourselves in these places where we just cannot shake what is

660
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
 going on.

661
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,800
 We just cannot break out of it.

662
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:32,200
 There's nothing in our strength that we can do to feel better.

663
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:39,160
 We're at the end of our ropes.

664
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,920
 Now what do we do when we find ourselves in that place?

665
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:50,040
 Where can we find hope and help in our pain and in our suffering?

666
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,600
 Now that's the question that I want to explore with you.

667
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,600
 What do we do?

668
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:00,920
 Now in some sense I think you know the answer that I'm going to give.

669
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,840
 What answer am I going to give?

670
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,320
 Come to Jesus, of course.

671
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,820
 But I want to unpack that in a deeper way.

672
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:17,720
 I want to take a closer look with you at who Jesus is and who God's word says Jesus is.

673
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,520
 And so unpack that question with us.

674
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,120
 So we're going to look at one verse from Matthew, and then we're going to look at a passage

675
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,640
 from the book of Acts.

676
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,840
 So let's start with a passage from Matthew, and I want to set the context for that.

677
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,200
 So we're in the birth narrative of Jesus.

678
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:44,440
 Joseph realizes that Mary is pregnant, and he silently wants to divorce her.

679
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:51,040
 But then in a dream an angel appears to him and reveals to him that Mary, the child that

680
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,840
 Mary's carrying, is conceived through the Holy Spirit.

681
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,880
 This is God's work.

682
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,760
 And so it encourages Joseph to keep the child.

683
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,320
 But then the angel gives further instructions.

684
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,880
 So this is the verse that we want to read.

685
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,720
 It's chapter 1, verse 21 in Matthew, and it says this.

686
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,800
 He will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save

687
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,920
 his people from their sins.

688
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:26,200
 Now, if you notice, there's a connection between the name Jesus and that he will save people

689
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,680
 from their sins.

690
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,240
 Now what is that connection?

691
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:35,440
 Well, let's look at what the name Jesus, where this comes from, and what the name Jesus actually

692
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,720
 means.

693
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:46,760
 The name Jesus is a Greek translation of the Hebrew Yeshua, which is a version of Joshua.

694
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,720
 In Joshua, the name means the Lord of salvation.

695
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,720
 The Lord saves.

696
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,440
 Yahweh saves.

697
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:02,360
 So we can say that it's like you're supposed to name him the Lord saves, for he will save

698
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,000
 people from their sins.

699
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,400
 So right up front, we're being told about who Jesus is, what his identity is, and what

700
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,000
 he is going to be doing.

701
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,920
 But there's more.

702
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,520
 The word that is used for save is sozo.

703
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:26,320
 And sozo is a word that has very far-reaching, a very broad range of meaning.

704
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:33,360
 Like the English doesn't fully capture it, or the word save doesn't fully capture it.

705
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:39,720
 It can mean to save, to rescue, to heal, rescue from disease.

706
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,760
 So I'm actually, even I was looking in the Greek dictionary, and I read like eight or

707
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,360
 nine different usage, and I was like, I'm not going to list 10 things here.

708
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:53,720
 But the gist of it is to save, to rescue, to heal.

709
00:47:53,720 --> 00:48:00,280
 And so it says that Jesus will save, rescue, heal people from their sins.

710
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:06,880
 Now a lot of times, or we're quite familiar with that it says that Jesus will heal people

711
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,260
 from their sins.

712
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:14,360
 But this would have actually been surprising to the contemporaries of Jesus that this is

713
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,680
 said about the Messiah.

714
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,400
 That's actually not what they were expecting.

715
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,680
 They were expecting a different type of Messiah, and I want to explain that.

716
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,740
 What they were expecting, they experienced three large bondages.

717
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:33,760
 There was the bondage with Exodus in Egypt, which you can read about in the story of Exodus,

718
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,760
 in the book of Exodus.

719
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,400
 There was the bondage in Babylon.

720
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,680
 And then during Jesus' time, there was the bondage to the Romans.

721
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,280
 So there was oppression, Roman oppression.

722
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:51,160
 And so the contemporaries, they were expecting Jesus to come and to deliver them from that

723
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,160
 oppression of the Romans, or that a Messiah to come deliver them from the oppression of

724
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:01,120
 the Romans, and to set up the Davidic throne again.

725
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,240
 So that's what people were expecting.

726
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,560
 But in here, as it is announced who Jesus is, it says that he will save, that he will

727
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,040
 deliver, that he will heal people from their sins.

728
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,400
 So why does focus on sin?

729
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,800
 So I want to go with you and look at the biblical storyline.

730
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,600
 It can be broken down into four acts.

731
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,760
 You can break it down different ways.

732
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,600
 This is the simplest one.

733
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,080
 You have creation, fall, redemption, new creation.

734
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:35,520
 And if you want to understand why the focus is sin, we need to look at that bigger story.

735
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,900
 So at the beginning, God created this world.

736
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,560
 He created it good.

737
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,560
 Everything in it was good.

738
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:47,360
 He created Adam and Eve in the image of God, and it was very good.

739
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:53,480
 Now Adam and Eve, they got to enjoy God's presence, live in God's presence, walk, talk

740
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,200
 with God.

741
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,940
 But then something happens.

742
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,440
 They rebel against God.

743
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:06,720
 Instead of being under his loving rule, they give in to temptation, and sin enters the

744
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,720
 world.

745
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,240
 That's what we refer to as the fall.

746
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:17,740
 Now sin, the effect of sin is far more far-reaching than a lot of times when we make it.

747
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,880
 Sin has impacted every fabric of human life.

748
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:28,240
 It's our relationship with God, our relationship with each other as people, our relationship

749
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,960
 with creation, and even our relationship with ourselves.

750
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:42,760
 So sin touches every fabric of this world, and there's damage to everything.

751
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:51,000
 Now God didn't leave us in this damaged state, so he starts this process of redemption.

752
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,700
 And that's the story of Abraham, of Israel, and then ultimately of Jesus, who comes to

753
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:04,280
 bring healing and restoration to all these different ways that sin has broken down our

754
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,400
 lives.

755
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,520
 So it's a holistic salvation.

756
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,800
 It's a holistic healing.

757
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:16,320
 A lot of times when you talk about sin and Jesus dying for our sins and addressing sin,

758
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,760
 we focus on our relationship with God, that he restores our relationship with God, that

759
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,960
 he brings us into the family of God.

760
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,120
 And that is the central thing in Scripture.

761
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,760
 That is the central thing.

762
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,940
 But salvation is so much broader.

763
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,400
 It's not just that.

764
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,200
 He wants to bring healing to us emotionally, spiritually, physically, in every aspect,

765
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:45,240
 and then ultimately lead us to new creation where all of who we are, everything is brought

766
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,280
 to wholeness.

767
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,280
 There's no more pain.

768
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,600
 There's no more tears.

769
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,040
 There's no more suffering.

770
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:59,720
 And so what is being announced in this passage in Matthew is that Jesus has come to bring

771
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:08,200
 complete wholeness into our lives, physical, emotional, relational, and spiritual wholeness.

772
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,880
 So when we say that Jesus is healer, he brings healing and has the power to bring healing

773
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,920
 to every aspect of who we are.

774
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,240
 He cares about everything.

775
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,920
 And so we don't want to minimize that and play that down and make it smaller.

776
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:31,200
 Jesus' salvation is broad and wide and so much wider than we often imagine.

777
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,600
 So he cares about our broken relationships.

778
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,160
 He cares about brokenness inside of us.

779
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,600
 He cares about our character.

780
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,240
 He cares about injustices in this world.

781
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,440
 And he's working to bring wholeness to all of those things in life.

782
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,680
 And one day, this work will be completed.

783
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:55,280
 But right now in Jesus, the kingdom of God has broken into this world.

784
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,000
 This new creation, the saving work has broken into this world.

785
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,800
 And we as a church, we are a new community that God has formed where he reveals the saving

786
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:14,760
 and this healing work through us and the work he's doing in our lives.

787
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:20,240
 So Jesus' name, it means he's savior and he's healer.

788
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:26,160
 And it's so much broader than we often give Jesus credit for.

789
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,840
 So that's the passage in Matthew.

790
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,640
 I'm going to be shorter on the passage in Acts.

791
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,680
 Now set the context for the story in Acts.

792
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:41,200
 So Peter and John, this is after Pentecost and all of that.

793
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,320
 So they go up to the Jerusalem temple and they end up healing.

794
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,600
 Peter ends up healing a lame man.

795
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,360
 And he can walk.

796
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,280
 Now this stirs up some excitement.

797
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,960
 And the authorities, they want to -- remember, they just crucified Jesus.

798
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,160
 So they don't want this movement to gain any momentum.

799
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,160
 They arrest them.

800
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,160
 They put them in jail.

801
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:09,080
 And the next day they come and they ask them to let them know by which name did you heal,

802
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,080
 do this healing.

803
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,080
 And so that's where we pick up the story.

804
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,320
 It's Acts chapter 4, verse 8.

805
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,880
 And it says this.

806
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,900
 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of the people,

807
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:32,300
 if you are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to man who is lame

808
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:39,540
 and are being asked how he was healed, then know this, you and all the people of Israel.

809
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:46,460
 It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, but whom God raised from

810
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:50,980
 the dead, that this man stands before you healed.

811
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:58,940
 Jesus is the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.

812
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:05,580
 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind

813
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:11,380
 by which we must be saved."

814
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:17,820
 Now what I love about this passage is that nobody's denying this healing that has taken

815
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,820
 place.

816
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,820
 It was so obvious.

817
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,940
 Perhaps the authorities even saw it themselves.

818
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:27,320
 This guy had experienced a miraculous healing to his body.

819
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,180
 Nobody could deny it.

820
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:33,220
 And when the authorities ask him, "By what power or what name did you do this?"

821
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:39,300
 Peter emphatically says, "It is in the name of Jesus that this man was healed, whom you

822
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,700
 crucified, but who was raised from the dead."

823
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:53,460
 He has the power to heal and to restore, and it's only in his name that there is salvation.

824
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,700
 It's only in his name that there's healing.

825
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:03,460
 Now here the word you see it's highlighted healed and saved.

826
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,420
 It's again this word "sozo."

827
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:09,180
 It's actually the same word, but it's translated in one part as healed and the other one saved.

828
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:19,140
 Again, Jesus' healing work is so much broader than we give Jesus credit to.

829
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:23,820
 And then the phrase in verse 12, "No other name under heaven given to mankind by which

830
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,620
 we must be saved."

831
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:34,220
 It's actually a radical statement because what Peter is saying through this is that

832
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:42,540
 the temple is obsolete, that the authorities that he's talking to, that healing is not

833
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,420
 found in them because Jesus has fulfilled the temple.

834
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:51,940
 He has created now the body of Christ as a new temple filled with a spirit.

835
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:56,940
 And so if you want healing, if you want salvation, you cannot bypass Jesus.

836
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:02,180
 So like I said, this is a radical statement as conversation with authorities, what he's

837
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,300
 saying, even what he's saying about them crucifying them and everything.

838
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:10,140
 So he's speaking very plainly but truthfully.

839
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:18,660
 So we see that both in Matthew and in Acts, that answers the question, when we have pain,

840
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,940
 when we have suffering, what do we do?

841
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,940
 Where do we go?

842
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:33,380
 And it says that salvation, that healing is found in no one else but Jesus.

843
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:37,660
 It's found in no one else but Jesus.

844
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,420
 What I, initially when I was looking at this passage, I was like, "Am I going to talk about

845
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,300
 the apologetics, you know, why that is?"

846
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,800
 But actually Peter just bears witness to this.

847
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,340
 This is what Jesus has done.

848
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:55,260
 And so what I want to do is I actually just want to share my testimony.

849
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:09,780
 I want to share how Jesus has met me in pain, in my own personal darkness and suffering,

850
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:16,660
 and how no one else could help me, not the people around me that loved me, not my family.

851
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,660
 Now they were helpful.

852
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:26,900
 I don't want to say they were not helpful, but healing was only found in Jesus.

853
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,360
 And I did ask my wife, Chris, for permission to share the story.

854
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,300
 I always ask her before I talk about this.

855
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,620
 I haven't talked to you guys about this.

856
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,340
 I've talked to Manchai about this previously.

857
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:42,460
 I've alluded to it here.

858
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:46,220
 I was married before.

859
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:55,500
 And in my first, my first wife, she came to me one day and she told me that she was not

860
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,380
 feeling good about our marriage.

861
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:06,660
 She also told me that she wasn't feeling good about me being a pastor.

862
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,580
 So this was in 2017.

863
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:18,340
 And so I started the process of stepping down from being a senior pastor of a small church.

864
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,100
 And of course, this takes a little time.

865
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,380
 So this was a three-month process.

866
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:27,020
 The last, the Saturday before my last Sunday, where my last time I'm preaching, farewell

867
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:31,620
 party, all of that, she tells me she needs to talk to me.

868
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,500
 But she only wants to talk to me with a therapist.

869
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,020
 I was like, okay.

870
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,340
 So we, she finds a therapist online.

871
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:42,260
 We go and talk to a therapist and she tells me that she doesn't want to be with me.

872
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,580
 She doesn't want to talk to me.

873
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,380
 And she wants to separate from me.

874
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:54,420
 And that she only wants to talk to me with a therapist.

875
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,900
 And I was caught off guard.

876
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:01,500
 Now, obviously, I knew that our marriage was not doing well.

877
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,500
 But this caught me off guard.

878
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:09,380
 So at this time, I'm, you know, I'm stepping down from the job that I love.

879
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,620
 So I'm losing my job.

880
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:12,620
 We had sold our house.

881
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,740
 We were going to move in a new apartment.

882
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,140
 Now she was moving into apartment.

883
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,420
 I didn't have anywhere to go.

884
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,420
 So I lost my house.

885
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:25,060
 And it looked like I'm also losing my marriage.

886
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:31,460
 And so we went through the, we went through the meeting with a therapist for three months.

887
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:36,900
 And then she concluded, you know, that there was no hope for us and ended up fighting for

888
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,380
 divorce.

889
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:46,660
 And you know, as a pastor, I helped other people see marriages restored.

890
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:54,900
 But I, but I couldn't do this for myself.

891
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:59,180
 And there was so much shame in that.

892
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:05,980
 You know, when your life, what you believe is right and everything, when it breaks down.

893
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,180
 And I felt powerless.

894
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:11,140
 It was nothing that I knew how to do or what I was able to do.

895
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:14,420
 And I felt acted upon.

896
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:21,720
 And I also, this was, this was very traumatic for me.

897
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,020
 Because I didn't see it coming.

898
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:30,540
 I lost my job, my wife, my home.

899
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,300
 And so I really didn't know what to do.

900
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:37,940
 You know, what do you do?

901
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:44,620
 So I ended up, well, for one, I ended up taking a job and I had a finance background.

902
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:46,780
 So I went the mortgage industry, which I couldn't stand.

903
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,900
 I'm like, every day, I'm like, I don't like this.

904
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,900
 I love being a pastor.

905
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,940
 Why am I doing this?

906
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:57,580
 But I really was, I really felt like I don't know how to move forward.

907
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:01,140
 And I had no hope for the future.

908
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:05,560
 Like, I couldn't anticipate something good happened.

909
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:11,980
 And I really said, Lord, if, you know, if you want to take me, take me.

910
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,580
 I don't care if I live anymore or not.

911
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:20,260
 And so, I mean, I was just broken.

912
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,260
 I had nothing.

913
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,340
 I didn't know what to do.

914
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:29,980
 And nobody, like I said, my family, they loved me, but they couldn't help.

915
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,660
 But in this time, I went to church.

916
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,700
 I went to other churches.

917
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:40,760
 But then after two months of doing that, I asked the pastor that took over if he minded

918
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,420
 if I come back to the church I was before.

919
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:47,300
 Because that's where all my friendships were.

920
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:51,980
 And it was, of course, embarrassing to go back to the church and people asking about

921
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:52,980
 your relationship.

922
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:56,620
 And, you know, there was a lot of shame.

923
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,300
 But I was like, I don't know what else to do.

924
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,460
 So I went back there.

925
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:03,660
 And it was hard.

926
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:11,260
 And then on one Sunday, during worship, this is the part I've told before, Jesus had a

927
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,260
 word for me.

928
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:17,020
 And he said, I'm not finished with you yet.

929
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,580
 I felt like he had finished with me.

930
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:26,380
 I felt like my life was over.

931
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:33,900
 And I didn't realize it at the time, but those words were healing words, you know, that Jesus

932
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:41,700
 spoke over me because he released faith and courage that I did not have.

933
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:47,460
 Oh, apparently I need this.

934
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:53,620
 Thanks, Debra.

935
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:59,340
 And then if Jesus is okay with me, well, then I must be okay.

936
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:06,460
 And if Jesus is okay with me, then perhaps maybe I can be a pastor one day again.

937
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:15,420
 And if Jesus is not finished with me, you know, I can be one day whole again.

938
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:20,380
 And so I actually, when I heard those words, I went outside and I was just sobbing and

939
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:24,100
 it was healing.

940
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:28,420
 So then to make a long, honestly, there's so many details in all of this, but to make

941
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:33,860
 a longer story short, you know, I ended up being hired by the Vine.

942
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:36,420
 These words of Jesus were the beginning of healing.

943
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,580
 This was a turning point.

944
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,580
 This healing journey has continued.

945
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:48,540
 I have had a lot of anxiety and fear and felt rejection and abandonment because when somebody

946
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:54,020
 leaves you, you wonder, is there something wrong with me?

947
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,020
 Am I not lovable?

948
01:04:55,020 --> 01:05:01,820
 You know, what makes somebody leave you?

949
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:05,580
 And so I felt these feelings in a lot of relationships and with coworkers and things.

950
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,220
 If anything shifted, I started feeling anxiety.

951
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:12,340
 I started feeling physical pain.

952
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,620
 And but Jesus has brought healing.

953
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:21,500
 And I have to give credit to the Vine and to Pastor Andrew.

954
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,980
 Like I mean, I was obviously very open in my interview about all these things.

955
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:29,620
 And I was not functioning well when they hired me.

956
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:33,460
 I was like at 65% or something.

957
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:37,540
 Every Sunday I was crying and weeping.

958
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:41,940
 And so at one time he came and he had a prophetic work on top of me already crying.

959
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,700
 And then I even just lost it.

960
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:47,060
 This was after three months of being in the church.

961
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:50,580
 And then I saw him the next week and I went to him and was like, Andrew, I'm so sorry

962
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,820
 that I keep losing it.

963
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:58,900
 You know, I keep totally, I mean, I'm not even able to minister to any people on a Sunday.

964
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,060
 You know, I'm just a mess.

965
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,900
 And he told me, Tim, why do you need to be sorry?

966
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:09,620
 It's a beautiful thing that you allow yourself to be ministered to by the Holy Spirit.

967
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:17,580
 I was like, wow, what kind of church is this?

968
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:23,700
 I can tell you if I would be at another church, I can do that once, maybe twice.

969
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:28,020
 But at the third time, the pastor would tell me to get my act together or to leave.

970
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:35,980
 You know, and I also want to give, you know, part of my healing journey, of course, was

971
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:42,020
 also meeting Chris, my wife, having my daughter Ellie.

972
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:44,420
 And so God really turned my life around.

973
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:48,780
 Being part of this church plant, I mean, I thought I had lost everything.

974
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,500
 And God has restored all these things in such a short period of time.

975
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,340
 And for me, and I don't know why I'm sharing this thought, but I felt like I should share

976
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:00,420
 this, so I think this is for someone.

977
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,780
 I was thinking of Ellie.

978
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:15,020
 I was like, God always knew that Ellie would exist.

979
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:19,780
 And you know, that just really has touched me, that God always knew that she would exist,

980
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:22,420
 that she has a purpose, that he loves her.

981
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:31,220
 So anyhow, like, I usually, if you're here for the first time, I usually cry like this.

982
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:38,780
 Since we're talking about healing and longing for healing, so for me, it's important that

983
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:44,340
 we are a church, that we have a church culture where we can share our brokenness, where we

984
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:49,700
 can bring our full selves into this community and where we can share.

985
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:55,620
 And it doesn't matter if that's a, you know, what it is, a small or a big thing.

986
01:07:55,620 --> 01:08:01,180
 But if we just come and pretend we're all doing great and we're all these amazing Christians

987
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:06,180
 with no problems and no issues, no need for healing, you know, we're going to miss out

988
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,660
 on what Jesus wants to do in our lives.

989
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,300
 I don't want to miss it.

990
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,740
 And so I wanted to give Jesus glory.

991
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:14,340
 I want to praise Jesus for his work in my life.

992
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:19,140
 And I want to ask the worship team to actually come up right now.

993
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:25,300
 And I want to say if Jesus has done this in my life, how he has met me in brokenness and

994
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:36,460
 emotional pain and in darkness, you know, has brought healing, I know that he can also

995
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:39,780
 do that in your life.

996
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:42,520
 I know he can do it in your life.

997
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:46,260
 And so what I want to encourage you right now, so one thing we do a lot of times as

998
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:51,420
 divine churches, we actually have a time of prayer.

999
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:57,940
 And so if you, if there's something that you need, you know, you need healing from, where

1000
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:03,660
 you want Jesus to touch you or to speak over your life and to just start this process of

1001
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:08,380
 rest, restoring you, of bringing wholeness, of making you well, it doesn't matter if it's

1002
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:14,980
 emotional, physically, spiritually, I want to encourage you to just stretch out your

1003
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,940
 hands before you.

1004
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:21,300
 Then when you stretch out your hands before you, I want to encourage others around you

1005
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:27,060
 just to come and just to pray for you, just to pray over you.

1006
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:32,140
 And I know this takes courage, but I want to encourage you to do it.

1007
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:36,980
 You know, Jesus is not finished with you yet.

1008
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:40,220
 Jesus is not finished with you if you're struggling with pornography addiction.

1009
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,340
 He's not finished with you yet.

1010
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:47,100
 He's not finished if your marriage is struggling.

1011
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,580
 He's not finished with you yet.

1012
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:53,380
 You know, whatever is going on, Jesus is not finished.

1013
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,180
 So just stretch out your hands.

1014
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:57,540
 And I just want to encourage people around you to pray.

1015
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:02,620
 So we're going to take a few minutes to pray, and then I'll close in prayers.

1016
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,420
 Let's do this right now.

1017
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,420
 Thank you.

1018
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:22,380
 So if you see someone with their hands stretched out, please go to them and pray for them.

1019
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:25,580
 Don't let somebody just sit there with their hands stretched out.

1020
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,580
 Okay?

1021
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:27,580
 Thank you.

1022
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:33,580
 Can we turn my microphone off for this part, please?

1023
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:35,580
 Thank you.

1024
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:42,580
 Thank you.

1025
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:49,580
 Thank you.

1026
01:10:49,580 --> 01:11:04,580
 Thank you.

1027
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:19,580
 Thank you.

1028
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:34,580
 Thank you.

1029
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:49,580
 Thank you.

1030
01:11:49,580 --> 01:12:04,580
 Thank you.

1031
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:19,580
 Thank you.

1032
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:34,580
 Thank you.

1033
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:49,580
 Thank you.

1034
01:12:49,580 --> 01:13:04,580
 Thank you.

1035
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:19,580
 Thank you.

1036
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:34,580
 Thank you.

1037
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:49,580
 Thank you.

1038
01:13:49,580 --> 01:14:04,580
 Thank you.

1039
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:19,580
 Thank you.

1040
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:34,580
 Thank you.

1041
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:49,580
 Thank you.

1042
01:14:49,580 --> 01:15:04,580
 Thank you.

1043
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:19,580
 Thank you.

1044
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:34,580
 Thank you.

1045
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:49,580
 Thank you.

1046
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:59,580
 Thank you.

1047
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:07,580
 Thank you.

1048
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:12,580
 I'm going to pray, but do feel free to continue to pray.

1049
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:16,580
 Jesus, thank you that your name means healer.

1050
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:18,580
 You are a healer.

1051
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:27,580
 There is no other name in which you find healing, in which we find your restoration, and where

1052
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,580
 we are made whole.

1053
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:33,580
 And Jesus, you've heard all these prayers, and even the ones that are going to be prayed

1054
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:34,580
 after this.

1055
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:44,580
 And I pray that you do beautiful work of just your restoration, of moving us to wholeness,

1056
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:52,580
 of providing in the area of need, of removing and lifting us out of some of that pain and

1057
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:56,580
 suffering in a way that only you are able to.

1058
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:07,580
 And may this be a turning point for us, where your work is unfolding in our community.

1059
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:14,580
 I pray that we can be a community of healing, where people can come and bring whatever has

1060
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:17,580
 happened in their lives, and they can come to you, Jesus.

1061
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:22,580
 And we can point them to you, and we can encourage each other, and we can pray for each other.

1062
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:27,580
 And Holy Spirit, I just thank you for your healing work.

1063
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:31,580
 Thank you that you're working right now, and we give you all the praise.

1064
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,580
 In your name, Jesus.

1065
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:34,580
 Amen.

1066
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:38,580
 So if you want to continue praying, feel free to pray, but also I want to invite those who

1067
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:41,580
 are ready to worship to stand up, and let's worship.

1068
01:17:55,580 --> 01:18:08,580
 I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind.

1069
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:13,580
 I know there is peace within your presence.

1070
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:21,580
 I speak Jesus.

1071
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:33,580
 I just want to speak the name of Jesus 'til every dark addiction starts to break.

1072
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:45,580
 Declaring there is hope and there is freedom, I speak Jesus.

1073
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:58,580
 Your name is power, your name is healing, your name is life.

1074
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:12,580
 Break every stronghold, shine through the shadows, burn like a fire.

1075
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:24,580
 I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind.

1076
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:30,580
 'Cause I know there is peace within your presence.

1077
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:33,580
 I speak Jesus.

1078
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:36,580
 One more time, verse one.

1079
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:49,580
 Oh, I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind.

1080
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:55,580
 'Cause I know there is peace within your presence.

1081
01:19:55,580 --> 01:20:01,580
 I speak Jesus.

1082
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:13,580
 Your name is power, your name is healing, your name is life.

1083
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:22,580
 Break every stronghold, shine through the shadows, burn like a fire.

1084
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:38,580
 Your name is power, your name is power, your name is healing, your name is life.

1085
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:53,580
 Break every stronghold, shine through the shadows, burn like a fire.

1086
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,580
 Wow.

1087
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:59,580
 Is that, am I the only one feeling that in the room?

1088
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:01,580
 Not right.

1089
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:08,580
 Church, I want you to come in the next couple of weeks with a different expectation.

1090
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:16,580
 I believe what Tim has been sharing today, it's raising the bar of faith in this community, in this room.

1091
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:20,580
 Come with a different expectation in the following weeks.

1092
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:28,580
 We're starting to talk about the healing of God, the physical healing, the emotional healing, the mental healing, the spiritual healing.

1093
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:34,580
 We're releasing this truth in this place and we are expecting to see healing in this room.

1094
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:37,580
 And today, it is just the beginning.

1095
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:40,580
 This is just for you to taste it a little bit.

1096
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:45,580
 We're going deeper and deeper and deeper into the healing truth of God.

1097
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:47,580
 Something is gonna be different.

1098
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:52,580
 You could expect when people walk through these doors, they will get healed.

1099
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:55,580
 They will get so-soed in this place.

1100
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:59,580
 Am I the only one believing that in this room?

1101
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:03,580
 If not, can I get an amen for that?

1102
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:08,580
 If you have faith in that, we gotta express it, church.

1103
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,580
 Don't be shy.

1104
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:12,580
 We're here to speak the name of Jesus.

1105
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:14,580
 We're here to speak that name.

1106
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,580
 There's no other name.

1107
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,580
 We're going to speak that name.

1108
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:22,580
 The name that means salvation, the name that means healing,

1109
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:29,580
 we're here to declare it over every stronghold, every darkness in our lives, in our families, in our city.

1110
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,580
 We're gonna do that.

1111
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:34,580
 And so we're gonna sing this one more time.

1112
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,580
 We're going to declare that name.

1113
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:42,580
 If this is a powerful name, I want you to believe it and sing it powerfully.

1114
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:46,580
 Let the way you sing match the way you believe.

1115
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:48,580
 Can we do that, church?

1116
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:50,580
 All right, there's like two people.

1117
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:52,580
 I hear two people.

1118
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:54,580
 Are we gonna do this, church?

1119
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:55,580
 Let's do this.

1120
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:56,580
 Come on.

1121
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:03,580
 Shout Jesus from the mountains and Jesus in the streets.

1122
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:09,580
 Jesus in the darkness over every enemy.

1123
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:12,580
 Jesus for my family.

1124
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:21,580
 I speak the holy name, Jesus.

1125
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:28,580
 Shout Jesus from the mountains and Jesus in the streets.

1126
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:34,580
 Jesus in the darkness over every enemy.

1127
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:37,580
 Jesus for my family.

1128
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:42,580
 I speak the holy name, Jesus.

1129
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:45,580
 Your name is power.

1130
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:48,580
 Your name is power.

1131
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:51,580
 Your name is healing.

1132
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:57,580
 Your name is life.

1133
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:00,580
 Break every stronghold.

1134
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:08,580
 Shine through the shadows.

1135
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:11,580
 Burn like a fire.

1136
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:15,580
 Your name, your name is power.

1137
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:18,580
 Your name is healing.

1138
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:24,580
 Your name is life.

1139
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,580
 Break every stronghold.

1140
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:31,580
 Shine through the shadows.

1141
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:37,580
 Burn like a fire.

1142
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,580
 Oh, I'm just so excited about this.

1143
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,580
 I hope you're excited as well.

1144
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:44,580
 Because something is gonna change in this place.

1145
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:49,580
 As this word is declared, something is gonna be different in our community.

1146
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:51,580
 We're gonna see healing.

1147
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,580
 Because now we know the truth.

1148
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:59,580
 We know that that name means the name above every name in this universe.

1149
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:02,580
 We know that name means healing.

1150
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:06,580
 And we're gonna live out this truth in this place.

1151
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:15,580
 And God, we're just so excited about what you're going to do in and through this church community.

1152
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,580
 This healing is not just for us.

1153
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,580
 It's not just for the people standing in this room.

1154
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:24,580
 It has to go through us into the community of Yuen Long, into Hong Kong as well.

1155
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:30,580
 So God, I thank you that because of the faithful preaching of Pastor Tim today,

1156
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:38,580
 there will be a faithful people here in Yuen Long believing, knowing that Jesus, you are the healer.

1157
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:45,580
 That we're going to live, we're going to go back to where we are and bringing this truth into our communities.

1158
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:50,580
 We're going to bring this healing into the places that you brought us to, Lord.

1159
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:56,580
 And we are going to declare that you are healer to this city, Lord.

1160
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:58,580
 We're going to declare that.

1161
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:04,580
 We're going to see the kind of healing that could only take place through you, Lord.

1162
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:09,580
 And so God, I pray today you will come and change us.

1163
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:15,580
 If we have so-called, if we have made peace with sickness, if we have made peace with brokenness,

1164
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:19,580
 where we say, "All right, just stay in my life. That's all right. You're here."

1165
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:25,580
 It's time that we say, "No, sorry. You got to get out of here because I belong to Jesus."

1166
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:29,580
 You got to get out of my life because I belong to Jesus.

1167
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:34,580
 And this is the declaration of this church here and in our city.

1168
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:42,580
 So God, we just pray you would come and give us a new level of faith through this message, through this sermon series.

1169
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:43,580
 Come and change us.

1170
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,580
 God, I thank you.

1171
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:46,580
 We praise you.

1172
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:48,580
 We love you.

1173
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:50,580
 We worship you.

1174
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,580
 And in the name of Jesus, we pray.

1175
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:55,580
 Everybody say, "Amen."

1176
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:56,580
 Amen.

1177
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,580
