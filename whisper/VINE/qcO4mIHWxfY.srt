00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 Hey, today we're starting a new sermon series and we've titled this sermon series, "Longing

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,840
 for Healing."

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,720
 Now, I don't know if you've ever longed for healing.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,340
 I certainly have.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,940
 So I think this is going to be very significant for us.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,800
 And so what we're going to do is we're going to look at Jesus and how it is in Jesus that

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,720
 we can find help, hope, healing, and wholeness.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,680
 Now what's interesting is when we look at the gospel and the encounters of Jesus with

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:42,340
 people, a lot of times people bring the obvious thing, the obvious need for healing to Jesus.

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,040
 Maybe it's the physical healing.

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,240
 Maybe it's the demon that needs to be driven out.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,960
 And in Jesus, you know, he heals.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,360
 He loves doing that.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,780
 But it doesn't just stop there.

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:00,200
 If we pay close attention, we can see that Jesus many times does a more holistic and

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,160
 a deeper healing in that person's life.

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,440
 A lot of times there's emotional healing.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,720
 There's social healing, bringing people back into community that were in isolation.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,280
 And so what we're going to do in this sermon series, we're going to look at these different

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,700
 ways that Jesus brings this healing to us.

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,120
 And we're going to look at what that means for us personally and how we can experience

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,120
 Jesus bring healing into our lives.

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,360
 Now I want to share with you the little bit of overview of where we're going to head.

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,820
 So we have seven weeks planned.

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,960
 I'm not going to talk through every title today.

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,160
 Our topic is "No Other Name."

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,040
 And so we're going to look at that in a little bit.

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,440
 But my heart for the sermon series is that we see that Jesus is healing.

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:00,840
 It's not just back then, but that Jesus wants to release and bring a healing to us here

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
 now.

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,480
 You know, he has the power to step in the areas where there's brokenness, where there's

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:14,880
 pain, where there's suffering, and to meet us in that, to provide the grace that we need,

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:23,040
 to maybe move forward, to provide the strength, to provide healing.

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,460
 So Jesus meets us in different ways, but he does meet us.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,700
 And so that's what we're going to be doing in the sermon series.

36
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,400
 Now some of us here might be sitting here and you're like, "Well, Tim, that is great.

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,240
 But I'm actually feeling good.

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,160
 I'm actually feeling fantastic."

39
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,840
 Well, that's awesome.

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,320
 Praise God.

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,080
 And I genuinely mean that.

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,080
 Praise God that you are feeling awesome, that there's nothing obvious right now in your

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:02,920
 life that needs Jesus to meet you, to bring healing, and to touch your life.

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,640
 But I do want to challenge you with this.

45
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:14,440
 You know, as Christians, part of our discipleship journey is an ongoing healing journey.

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,200
 It's actually for every Christian.

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,120
 And the Bible talks about salvation in three different ways.

48
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,280
 I was saved, I am being saved, and I will be saved.

49
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,960
 So there's a past, a present, and a future way that scripture talks about this.

50
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:43,520
 So that means that even if we are Christians, we are still in the process of being made

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,840
 whole.

52
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,240
 Jesus is still at work in us.

53
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,080
 He's not finished with us.

54
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,920
 There's still things to be done.

55
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,160
 There's still areas where we need healing in our lives, where we need restoration, where

56
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:03,080
 we need wholeness, where we need to be well.

57
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:12,560
 And so I want to challenge you to be open to this holistic healing work of Jesus.

58
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,440
 And I want to encourage you to actually pray a prayer, to ask the Holy Spirit to reveal

59
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:27,460
 to you where He wants to do some healing and restoring work in your life.

60
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,440
 Maybe it's in your character.

61
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
 Maybe it's part of your history.

62
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,600
 Maybe there's a breakup that has just been painful and you're just hung up on and you're

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
 not able to move forward.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,480
 Whatever it may be, but I want to encourage you to ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to you

65
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,560
 where He wants to do some healing work in your life.

66
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,320
 And whatever the Holy Spirit surfaces, it's always good.

67
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,280
 It's His timing.

68
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,760
 And we can, even though maybe it's not always easy when we go through a healing process,

69
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:08,200
 but He's gentle with us and He will lead us through to a better place to bring wholeness

70
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
 into our lives.

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,240
 So I actually want to encourage us right now to take just 30 seconds or a minute, just

72
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,160
 pray this prayer as we set off on this sermon series.

73
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,280
 So let's do that right now.

74
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
 Just you on your own.

75
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:52,080
 Yes, Holy Spirit, we, you know, every one of our lives, you know everything about us.

76
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,120
 The things that are well and that are awesome and that are good, but also where we're carrying

77
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,400
 shame and carrying brokenness and, or just hurt from the past that we can't even name.

78
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,760
 And Lord, we thank you that you are a healer, that you are rescued, that you are a savior.

79
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,880
 And we ask that in this time as you heard the prayers, as we just open our hearts and

80
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,760
 our lives to you, that you do your beautiful and healing work in us as a community.

81
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,080
 Now also thank you that you've given us each other to journey with each other in this,

82
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,160
 that we're not alone in that.

83
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,320
 I pray this in your name, Jesus.

84
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,720
 Amen.

85
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,320
 Now today our message is no other name.

86
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,360
 End of 2023, I was feeling pain that was keeping me up at night.

87
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
 So I'm laying in bed, I can't sleep.

88
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,480
 I don't know if you've had this where you shift around and it doesn't matter how you

89
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,600
 lay you're still not feeling good.

90
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,680
 So after a few nights like that, I was like, I think I need to go to the doctor.

91
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,240
 So I go to the GP, he asked me diagnostic questions.

92
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,240
 And then he concludes, he tells me, well, I believe you have something that is quite

93
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,000
 common among older men.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,640
 I was like, thank you for letting me know that I'm getting older.

95
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,880
 So he ended up giving me antibiotics.

96
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,360
 I take them, I feel better.

97
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,000
 I think everything's okay.

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,880
 A month later, this pain comes back again, but this time a little bit worse.

99
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,280
 So I go to the specialist, they do CT scan, blood work.

100
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,520
 Again I get antibiotics, which seems to be the solution for everything.

101
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,960
 And I've started feeling better.

102
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,400
 But this time, literally just for a week, and then I take a turn for the worse.

103
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,480
 I'm in pain sitting, I'm in pain standing, I'm in pain laying.

104
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,360
 Doesn't matter, basically doesn't matter what I do, I'm in pain and not feeling good.

105
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:05,600
 Now a friend of mine who is knowledgeable about what the diagnosis was, so he encouraged

106
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
 me to walk.

107
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,920
 He's like, maybe if you walk, it will feel better.

108
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,480
 It's like walking, really?

109
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,920
 Is that really going to help?

110
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,880
 I was skeptical, I was like, yeah, I'll give it a try.

111
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,520
 So I go out for a walk.

112
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,840
 Now, one thing you might not know is I actually like walking.

113
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,460
 So a lot of times I go for an hour walk trying to be healthy or healthier, I should say.

114
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,120
 So I started walking, I mean, I can hardly walk.

115
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,440
 And after a few hundred meters, I was like, something is wrong, something's not right.

116
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,080
 So I go home to my wife, Chris.

117
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,760
 I tell her I need to go to the A&E room.

118
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:47,640
 Now I don't know if you've ever been in a place where you experience just pain, whether

119
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,760
 it's physical pain or emotional pain, where you're just longing, you're just longing to

120
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
 be well.

121
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,480
 I just want to be well, I don't want to feel this pain anymore, I want to be able to sleep,

122
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,880
 I want to be able to sit.

123
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,120
 I couldn't even tie my shoes, I couldn't even bend over to tie my shoes.

124
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,920
 I don't want to ask my wife to tie my shoes, Lord.

125
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,200
 So that's the place I was in.

126
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,800
 So I went to the A&E room, to make a long story short, they end up admitting me to the

127
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,560
 hospital, they do surgery, there was an immediate relief, and I'm actually still recovering

128
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,880
 right now.

129
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,760
 So recovering with a wound from the surgery, so that takes a while.

130
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,240
 But I know I'm not alone in this.

131
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,600
 That we all at one point or another, we long for healing.

132
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
 For me it was longing for physical healing.

133
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,960
 For you maybe it's emotional healing, mental healing, spiritual healing.

134
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,880
 Maybe we know we're not right with Jesus, and for whatever reason we just struggle to

135
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,160
 be in the right place with Jesus, and we just long for spiritual healing.

136
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:00,340
 And that sometimes we find ourselves in these places where we just cannot shake what is

137
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
 going on.

138
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,720
 We just cannot break out of it.

139
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:11,120
 There's nothing in our strength that we can do to feel better.

140
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,080
 We're at the end of our ropes.

141
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,840
 Now what do we do when we find ourselves in that place?

142
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:28,960
 Where can we find hope and help in our pain and in our suffering?

143
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,500
 Now that's the question that I want to explore with you.

144
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
 What do we do?

145
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,820
 Now in some sense I think you know the answer that I'm going to give.

146
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,740
 What answer am I going to give?

147
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,200
 Come to Jesus, of course.

148
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,720
 But I want to unpack that in a deeper way.

149
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,620
 I want to take a closer look with you at who Jesus is and who God's word says Jesus is.

150
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,440
 And so unpack that question with us.

151
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,020
 So we're going to look at one verse from Matthew, and then we're going to look at a passage

152
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,540
 from the book of Acts.

153
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,740
 So let's start with a passage from Matthew, and I want to set the context for that.

154
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,100
 So we're in the birth narrative of Jesus.

155
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:23,340
 Joseph realizes that Mary is pregnant, and he silently wants to divorce her.

156
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:30,180
 But then in a dream an angel appears to him and reveals to him that the child that Mary

157
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,740
 is carrying is conceived through the Holy Spirit.

158
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,780
 This is God's work.

159
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,660
 And so it encourages Joseph to keep the child.

160
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,220
 But then the angel gives further instructions.

161
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,780
 So this is the verse that we want to read.

162
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,620
 It's chapter 1, verse 21 in Matthew, and it says this.

163
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:53,260
 She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will

164
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,820
 save his people from their sins.

165
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:05,100
 Now, if you notice, there's a connection between the name Jesus and that he will save people

166
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,580
 from their sins.

167
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,140
 Now what is that connection?

168
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:14,340
 Well, let's look at what the name Jesus, where this comes from, and what the name Jesus actually

169
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,620
 means.

170
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:25,660
 The name Jesus is a Greek translation of the Hebrew Yeshua, which is a version of Joshua.

171
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,620
 In Joshua, the name means the Lord of salvation.

172
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,620
 The Lord saves.

173
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,340
 Yahweh saves.

174
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,260
 So we can say that it's like you're supposed to name him the Lord saves, for he will save

175
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,900
 people from their sins.

176
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,300
 So right up front, we're being told about who Jesus is, what his identity is, and what

177
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,900
 he is going to be doing.

178
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,820
 But there's more.

179
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,420
 The word that is used for save is sozo.

180
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:05,220
 And sozo is a word that has very far-reaching, a very broad range of meaning.

181
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:12,260
 Like the English doesn't fully capture it, or the word save doesn't fully capture it.

182
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:18,620
 It can mean to save, to rescue, to heal, rescue from disease.

183
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,660
 So I'm actually even, I was looking in the Greek dictionary, and I read like eight or

184
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,260
 nine different usage, and I was like, I'm not going to list 10 things here.

185
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:32,620
 But the gist of it is to save, to rescue, to heal.

186
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:39,180
 And so it says that Jesus will save, rescue, heal people from their sins.

187
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,780
 Now a lot of times, or we're quite familiar with that it says that Jesus will heal people

188
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,160
 from their sins.

189
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,260
 But this would have actually been surprising to the contemporaries of Jesus that this is

190
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,580
 said about the Messiah.

191
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,300
 That's actually not what they were expecting.

192
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,580
 They were expecting a different type of Messiah, and I want to explain that.

193
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,640
 What they were expecting, they experienced three large bondages.

194
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,660
 There was the bondage with Exodus in Egypt, which you can read about in the story of Exodus,

195
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,660
 in the book of Exodus.

196
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,300
 There was the bondage in Babylon.

197
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,580
 And then during Jesus' time, there was the bondage to the Romans.

198
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,180
 So there was oppression, Roman oppression.

199
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:30,060
 And so the contemporaries, they were expecting Jesus to come and to deliver them from that

200
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,060
 oppression of the Romans, or that a Messiah to come deliver them from the oppression of

201
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:40,020
 the Romans, and to set up the Davidic throne again.

202
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,140
 So that's what people were expecting.

203
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,460
 But in here, as it is announced who Jesus is, it says that he will save, that he will

204
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,940
 deliver, that he will heal people from their sins.

205
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,300
 So why does focus on sin?

206
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,700
 So I want to go with you and look at the biblical storyline.

207
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,500
 It can be broken down into four acts.

208
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,660
 You can break it down different ways.

209
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,500
 This is the simplest one.

210
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,980
 We have creation, fall, redemption, new creation.

211
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:14,420
 And if you want to understand why the focus is sin, we need to look at that bigger story.

212
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,820
 So at the beginning, God created this world.

213
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,460
 He created it good.

214
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
 Everything in it was good.

215
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:26,260
 He created Adam and Eve in the image of God, and it was very good.

216
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,380
 Now Adam and Eve, they got to enjoy God's presence, live in God's presence, walk, talk

217
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,100
 with God.

218
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,840
 But then something happens.

219
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,340
 They rebel against God.

220
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:45,620
 Instead of being under his loving rule, they give in to temptation, and sin enters the

221
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,620
 world.

222
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,140
 That's what we refer to as the fall.

223
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:56,640
 Now sin, the effect of sin is far more far-reaching than a lot of times when we make it.

224
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,780
 Sin has impacted every fabric of human life.

225
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:07,140
 It's our relationship with God, our relationship with each other as people, our relationship

226
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,860
 with creation, and even our relationship with ourselves.

227
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:21,660
 So sin touches every fabric of this world, and there's damage to everything.

228
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:29,900
 Now God didn't leave us in this damaged state, so he starts this process of redemption.

229
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,620
 And that's the story of Abraham, of Israel, and then ultimately of Jesus, who comes to

230
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:43,180
 bring healing and restoration to all these different ways that sin has broken down our

231
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,320
 lives.

232
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,420
 So it's a holistic salvation.

233
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,700
 It's a holistic healing.

234
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:55,220
 A lot of times when you talk about sin and Jesus dying for our sins and addressing sin,

235
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,660
 we focus on our relationship with God, that he restores our relationship with God, that

236
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,820
 he brings us into the family of God.

237
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,980
 And that is the central thing in Scripture.

238
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,620
 That is the central thing.

239
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,800
 But salvation is so much broader.

240
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,260
 It's not just that.

241
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:17,060
 He wants to bring healing to us emotionally, spiritually, physically, in every aspect,

242
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:24,100
 and then ultimately lead us to new creation where all of who we are, everything is brought

243
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,100
 to wholeness.

244
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
 There is no more pain.

245
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,420
 There is no more tears.

246
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,940
 There is no more suffering.

247
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:38,500
 And so what is being announced in this passage in Matthew is that Jesus has come to bring

248
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:47,100
 complete wholeness into our lives, physical, emotional, relational, and spiritual wholeness.

249
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,800
 So when we say that Jesus is healer, he brings healing and has the power to bring healing

250
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,860
 to every aspect of who we are.

251
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,180
 He cares about everything.

252
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,860
 And so we don't want to minimize that and play that down and make it smaller.

253
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:10,140
 Jesus' salvation is broad and wide and so much wider than we often imagine.

254
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,540
 So he cares about our broken relationships.

255
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,100
 He cares about brokenness inside of us.

256
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,540
 He cares about our character.

257
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,180
 He cares about injustices in this world.

258
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,380
 And he's working to bring wholeness to all of those things in life.

259
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,620
 And one day, this work will be completed.

260
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,200
 But right now in Jesus, the kingdom of God has broken into this world.

261
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,940
 This new creation, the saving work has broken into this world.

262
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,620
 And we as a church, we are a new community that God has formed where he reveals the saving

263
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:53,700
 and the healing work through us and the work he's doing in our lives.

264
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,180
 So Jesus' name, it means he's savior and he's healer.

265
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:05,100
 And it's so much broader than we often give Jesus credit for.

266
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,780
 So that's the passage in Matthew.

267
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,580
 I'm going to be shorter in the passage in Acts.

268
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,620
 Now set the context for the story in Acts.

269
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:20,140
 So Peter and John, this is after Pentecost and all of that.

270
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,020
 So they go up to the Jerusalem temple and they end up healing -- Peter ends up healing

271
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,540
 a lame man.

272
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,300
 And he can walk.

273
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,220
 Now this stirs up some excitement.

274
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,900
 And the authorities, they want to -- remember, they just crucified Jesus.

275
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,100
 So they don't want this movement to gain any momentum.

276
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
 They arrest them.

277
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,100
 They put them in jail.

278
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:47,980
 The next day, they come and they ask them to let them know by which name did you heal,

279
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,980
 do this healing.

280
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,980
 And so that's where we pick up the story.

281
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,220
 It's Acts chapter 4, verse 8.

282
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,780
 And it says -- it says this.

283
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,820
 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of the people,

284
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,220
 if we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to man who was lame

285
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:18,460
 and are being asked how he was healed, then know this, you and all the people of Israel.

286
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,380
 It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, but whom God raised from

287
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,380
 the dead, that this man stands before you healed.

288
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:37,820
 Jesus is the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.

289
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:44,460
 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind

290
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,260
 by which we must be saved."

291
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:56,700
 Now what I love about this passage is that nobody's denying this healing that has taken

292
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
 place.

293
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,960
 It was so obvious.

294
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,820
 Perhaps the authorities even saw it themselves.

295
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,980
 This guy had experienced a miraculous healing to his body, and nobody could deny it.

296
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,100
 And when the authority is asking, "By what power or what name did you do this?"

297
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:18,180
 Peter emphatically says, "It is in the name of Jesus that this man was healed, whom you

298
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,540
 crucified, but who was raised from the dead."

299
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:32,380
 He has the power to heal and to restore, and it's only in his name that there is salvation.

300
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,620
 It's only in his name that there's healing.

301
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:42,380
 Now here the word, you see it's highlighted healed and saved.

302
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,340
 It's again this word "sozo."

303
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,180
 It's actually the same word, but it's translated in one part as healed and the other one as

304
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,180
 saved.

305
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:58,060
 So again, Jesus' healing work is so much broader than we give Jesus credit to.

306
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,740
 And then the phrase in verse 12, "No other name under heaven given to mankind by which

307
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,540
 we must be saved."

308
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:13,100
 It's actually a radical statement because what Peter is saying through this is that

309
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:21,420
 the temple is obsolete, that the authorities that he's talking to, that healing is not

310
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,300
 found in them because Jesus has fulfilled the temple.

311
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,820
 He has created now the body of Christ as a new temple filled with a spirit.

312
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,820
 And so if you want healing, if you want salvation, you cannot bypass Jesus.

313
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,980
 So like I said, this is a radical statement, this conversation with the authorities, what

314
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,180
 he's saying, even what he's saying about them crucifying them and everything.

315
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,020
 So he's speaking very plainly but truthfully.

316
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:57,540
 So we see that both in Matthew and in Acts, that answers the question, when we have pain,

317
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,820
 when we have suffering, what do we do?

318
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,900
 Where do we go?

319
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:12,260
 And it says that salvation, that healing is found in no one else but Jesus.

320
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,540
 It's found in no one else but Jesus.

321
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,260
 What I, initially when I was looking at this passage, I was like, "Am I going to talk about

322
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,180
 the apologetics, you know, why that is?"

323
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,660
 But actually Peter just bears witness to this.

324
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,180
 This is what Jesus has done.

325
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,140
 And so what I want to do is I actually just want to share my testimony.

326
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:48,640
 I want to share how Jesus has met me in pain, in my own personal darkness and suffering,

327
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,500
 and how no one else could help me, not the people around me that loved me, not my family.

328
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
 Now they were helpful.

329
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:05,820
 I don't want to say they were not helpful, but healing was only found in Jesus.

330
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,300
 And I did ask my wife, Chris, for permission to share the story.

331
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,220
 I always ask her before I talk about this.

332
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,540
 I haven't talked to you guys about this.

333
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,300
 I've talked to Manchai about this previously.

334
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,380
 I've alluded to it here.

335
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,140
 I was married before.

336
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:34,420
 And in my first, my first wife, she came to me one day and she told me that she was not

337
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,300
 feeling good about our marriage.

338
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:45,580
 She also told me that she wasn't feeling good about me being a pastor.

339
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,500
 So this was in 2017.

340
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:57,260
 And so I started the process of stepping down from being a senior pastor of a small church.

341
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,020
 And of course, this takes a little time.

342
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,300
 So this was a three-month process.

343
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,900
 The last, the Saturday before my last Sunday, where my last time I'm preaching, farewell

344
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,500
 party, all of that, she tells me she needs to talk to me.

345
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,420
 But she only wants to talk to me with a therapist.

346
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,940
 I was like, okay.

347
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,100
 So we, she finds a therapist online.

348
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,180
 We go and talk to a therapist and she tells me that she doesn't want to be with me.

349
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,500
 She doesn't want to talk to me.

350
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,380
 And she wants to separate from me.

351
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:33,340
 And that she only wants to talk to me with a therapist.

352
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,140
 And I was caught off guard.

353
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:40,460
 Now obviously I knew that our marriage was not doing well.

354
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,440
 But this caught me off guard.

355
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:48,340
 So at this time, I'm, you know, I'm stepping down from the job that I love.

356
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,580
 So I'm losing my job.

357
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
 We had sold our house.

358
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,700
 We were going to move in a new apartment.

359
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,100
 Now she was moving into apartment.

360
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,380
 I didn't have anywhere to go.

361
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,340
 So I lost my house.

362
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,020
 And it looked like I'm also losing my marriage.

363
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:10,420
 And so we went through the, we went through the meeting with a therapist for three months.

364
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,860
 And then she concluded, you know, that there was no hope for us and ended up fighting for

365
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,340
 a divorce.

366
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:25,580
 And you know, as a pastor, I helped other people see marriages restored.

367
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:33,860
 But I, but I couldn't do this for myself.

368
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,140
 And there was so much shame in that.

369
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:44,900
 You know, when your life, what you believe is right and everything, when it breaks down.

370
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,100
 And I felt powerless.

371
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,060
 It was nothing that I knew how to do or what I was able to do.

372
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,340
 And I felt acted upon.

373
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:00,640
 And I also, this was, this was very traumatic for me.

374
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,940
 Because I didn't see it coming.

375
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:09,420
 I lost my job, my wife, my home.

376
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,180
 And so I really didn't know what to do.

377
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,820
 You know, what do you do?

378
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:23,380
 So I ended up, well, for one, I ended up taking a job and I had a finance background.

379
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,700
 So I went the mortgage industry, which I couldn't stand.

380
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,820
 I'm like, every day, I'm like, I don't like this.

381
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
 I love being a pastor.

382
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,820
 Why am I doing this?

383
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:36,460
 But I really was, I really felt like I don't know how to move forward.

384
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,020
 And I had no hope for the future.

385
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,440
 Like I couldn't anticipate something good happen.

386
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:50,860
 And I really said, Lord, if, you know, if you want to take me, take me.

387
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,460
 I don't care if I live anymore or not.

388
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:59,180
 And so, I mean, I was just broken.

389
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
 I had nothing.

390
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,260
 I didn't know what to do.

391
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:08,900
 And nobody, like I said, my family, they loved me, but they couldn't help.

392
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,580
 But in this time, I went to church.

393
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,620
 I went to other churches.

394
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:19,700
 But then after two months of doing that, I asked the pastor that took over if he minded

395
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,340
 if I come back to the church I was before.

396
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,220
 Because that's where all my friendships were.

397
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,900
 And it was, of course, embarrassing to go back to the church and people asking about

398
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,900
 your relationship.

399
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,500
 And, you know, there was a lot of shame.

400
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,220
 But I was like, I don't know what else to do.

401
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,340
 So I went back there.

402
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,580
 And it was hard.

403
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:50,180
 And then on one Sunday, during worship, this is the part I've told before, Jesus had a

404
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,180
 word for me.

405
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:55,900
 And he said, I'm not finished with you yet.

406
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,500
 I felt like he had finished with me.

407
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,300
 I felt like my life was over.

408
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:12,780
 And I didn't realize it at the time, but those words were healing words, you know, that Jesus

409
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:20,580
 spoke over me because he released faith and courage that I did not have.

410
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:26,380
 Oh, apparently I need this.

411
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:32,100
 Thanks, Deborah.

412
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:38,260
 And then if Jesus is okay with me, well, then I must be okay.

413
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:45,380
 And if Jesus is okay with me, then perhaps maybe I can be a pastor one day again.

414
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:54,340
 And if Jesus is not finished with me, you know, I can be one day whole again.

415
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,300
 And so I actually when I heard those words, I went outside and I was just sobbing and

416
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,020
 it was healing.

417
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,340
 So then to make a long, honestly, there's so many details in all of this, but to make

418
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:12,780
 a longer story short, you know, I ended up being hired by the Vine.

419
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,340
 These words of Jesus were the beginning of healing.

420
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,500
 This was a turning point.

421
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 This healing journey has continued.

422
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:27,460
 I have had a lot of anxiety and fear and felt rejection and abandonment because when somebody

423
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:32,900
 leaves you, you wonder, is there something wrong with me?

424
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,060
 Am I not lovable?

425
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:40,740
 You know, what makes somebody leave you?

426
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,500
 And so I felt these feelings in a lot of relationships and with coworkers and things.

427
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,100
 If anything shifted, I started feeling anxiety.

428
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,220
 I started feeling physical pain.

429
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,500
 And but Jesus has brought healing.

430
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:00,420
 And I have to give credit to the Vine and to Pastor Andrew.

431
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,900
 Like I mean, I was obviously very open in my interview about all these things.

432
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,500
 And I was not functioning well when they hired me.

433
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,340
 I was like at 65% or something.

434
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,420
 Every Sunday I was crying and weeping.

435
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,820
 And so at one time he came and he had a prophetic work on top of me already crying.

436
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,580
 And then I even just lost it.

437
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,940
 This was after three months of being in the church.

438
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,460
 And then I saw him the next week and I went to him and was like, Andrew, I'm so sorry

439
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,700
 that I keep losing it.

440
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,780
 You know, I keep totally I mean, I'm not even able to minister to any people on a Sunday.

441
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,020
 You know, I'm just a mess.

442
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,820
 And he told me, Tim, why do you need to be sorry?

443
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:48,580
 It's a beautiful thing that you allow yourself to be ministered to by the Holy Spirit.

444
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:56,500
 I was like, wow, what kind of church is this?

445
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:02,620
 I can tell you if I would be at another church, I can do that once, maybe twice.

446
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:08,900
 But at the third time, the pastor would tell me to get my act together or to leave.

447
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,900
 You know, now I also want to give you know, part of my healing journey, of course, was

448
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:20,940
 also meeting Chris, my wife, having my daughter Ellie.

449
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,860
 And so God really turned my life around being being part of this church plant.

450
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,700
 I mean, I thought I had lost everything.

451
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,420
 And God has restored all these things in such a short period of time.

452
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,340
 And for me, and I don't know why I'm sharing this thought, but I felt like I should share

453
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,340
 this.

454
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,340
 So I think this is for someone.

455
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:42,700
 I was thinking of Ellie.

456
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:53,940
 I was like, God always knew that Ellie would exist.

457
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,700
 And you know, that just really has touched me that God always knew that she would exist,

458
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,300
 that she has a purpose and he loves her.

459
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:10,100
 So anyhow, like I usually if you're here for the first time, I usually cry like this.

460
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:16,100
 Since we're talking about healing and longing for healing.

461
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:21,700
 So for me, it's important that we are a church, that we have a church culture where we can

462
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:28,100
 share our brokenness, where we can bring our full selves into this community and where

463
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
 we can share.

464
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:34,540
 It doesn't matter if that's a, you know, what it is a smaller, a big thing.

465
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:40,100
 But if we just come and pretend we're all doing great, and we're all these amazing Christians

466
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,420
 with no problems and no issues, no need for healing.

467
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,580
 And we're going to miss out on what Jesus wants to do in our lives.

468
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,260
 I don't want to miss it.

469
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,740
 And so I wanted to give Jesus glory.

470
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,300
 I want to praise Jesus for his work in my life.

471
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,060
 And I want to ask the worship team to actually come up right now.

472
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:04,220
 And I want to say if Jesus has done this in my life, how he has met me in brokenness and

473
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:12,420
 emotional pain and darkness, you know, has brought healing.

474
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:18,700
 I know that he can also do that in your life.

475
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,460
 I know he can do it in your life.

476
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,100
 And so what I want to encourage you right now, so one thing we do a lot of times as

477
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,340
 divine churches, we actually have a time of prayer.

478
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:36,860
 And so if you, if there's something that you need, you know, you need healing from, where

479
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:43,340
 you want Jesus to touch you or to speak over your life and to just start this process of

480
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,300
 restoring you, of bringing wholeness, of making you well.

481
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,900
 It doesn't matter if it's emotional, physically, spiritually.

482
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:56,860
 I want to encourage you to just stretch out your hands before you.

483
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,220
 Then when you stretch out your hands before you, I want to encourage others around you

484
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:05,980
 just to come and just to pray for you, just to pray over you.

485
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,980
 And I know this takes courage, but I want to encourage you to do it.

486
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,860
 You know, Jesus is not finished with you yet.

487
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,140
 Jesus is not finished with you if you're struggling with pornography addiction.

488
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,460
 He's not finished with you yet.

489
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:26,060
 Jesus is not finished if your marriage is struggling.

490
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,500
 He's not finished with you yet.

491
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,300
 You know, whatever is going on, Jesus is not finished.

492
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,140
 So just stretch out your hands.

493
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,460
 And I just want to encourage people around you to pray.

494
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,540
 So we're going to take a few minutes to pray, and then I'll close in our prayers.

495
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,540
 Let's do this right now.

496
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,540
 Thank you.

497
00:35:43,540 --> 00:36:01,260
 So if you see someone with their hands stretched out, please go to them and pray for them.

498
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,500
 Don't let somebody just sit there with their hands stretched out.

499
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
 Okay?

500
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,500
 Thank you.

501
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:32,820
 Can we turn my microphone off for this part, please?

502
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:39,900
 Thank you.

503
00:36:39,900 --> 00:37:03,340

521
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:18,740
