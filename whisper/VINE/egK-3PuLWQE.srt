1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 "O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,040
 who mourn in lonely exile here,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,000
 until the Son of God appears."

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,920
 I wonder if you can hear the longing

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,020
 and the crying out for change

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,200
 that is found in those beautiful lyrics

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,220
 of that famous carol and in the visual imagery

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,480
 that our creative team created in that opener for you.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,460
 Because this longing, this crying out

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,740
 for the Son of God to appear

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,680
 is what sits at the very heart of the Advent season

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,880
 that we enter into today and over the coming Sundays

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,280
 that lead up to Christmas morning.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,980
 Advent itself is driven actually

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,040
 from the Latin word adventus,

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,600
 which literally means arrival or coming.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,200
 And here at The Vine over the last many, many years,

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,720
 we've always celebrated this idea

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,120
 that we must prepare ourselves as a church

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,560
 for the arrival of Jesus who is born on Christmas day.

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,680
 And so Advent in our celebrations here at The Vine,

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,720
 for as far back as I can remember,

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,000
 have always been about this thought

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 that Christ was born on Christmas day

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,680
 and we need to prepare ourselves for his arrival.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,560
 And so all of our sermon series

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,080
 and everything we've kind of preached during this season

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
 has been out of the gospels,

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,560
 out of the story in Matthew and Luke

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,080
 of Jesus's birth and the prophetic ways

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,240
 in which that birth happens

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,400
 and the miraculous things that take place in that moment.

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
 But here's the reality.

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,240
 The birth of Jesus is actually just one side

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,280
 of the whole Advent story.

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,860
 In fact, the season of Advent historically

37
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,120
 in the global church for over 2000 years

38
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,320
 actually contains two sides to its story.

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,560
 Yes, it is the side of the story

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,720
 of the arrival of Jesus as a child in Bethlehem,

41
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,880
 in the manger and everything that we've celebrated usually,

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,920
 but it is also the story of Jesus coming back

43
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,840
 to the world again at the end of all things

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
 as a conquering king.

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,560
 Advent, if you will, holds intention

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,880
 these two parts of the Christmas story.

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,640
 Christmas, you may not realize,

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,840
 is not just about the birth of Jesus.

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,780
 The birth of Jesus starts the redemptive story

50
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,620
 of Jesus Christ.

51
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,000
 And so Advent as a season for the church

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,460
 also looks forward in longing for the reality

53
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,200
 of the return of Jesus at the end of all things.

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,320
 And when he comes back, he will, if you will,

55
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,680
 complete that total story of redemption,

56
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,540
 of humanity and creation.

57
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,240
 Advent is the wonder of longing

58
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,640
 for Christmas to be complete.

59
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,640
 It celebrates the birth and the return of Jesus.

60
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,840
 If you will, Advent is kind of emphasizing the bookends

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,800
 around the redemptive story of Christ,

62
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,920
 his birth and his return with the idea

63
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,720
 that if you could really understand

64
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,020
 what is there at the end of all things,

65
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,640
 if you can really understand what it's like

66
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,520
 to long for Christ to come and step back into this world,

67
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,800
 if you can understand that, that actually critically

68
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,200
 helps you to fully understand what happens on Christmas day.

69
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,040
 Or I would say it a little bit more challenging

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,960
 to you in this way.

71
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,160
 If you really want to live as best you can

72
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,800
 as a Christian in this day's world,

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,000
 you don't need to know just only

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,800
 how your Christian story began,

75
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,400
 you also need to know how it will end.

76
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,880
 For once you see what Christ does at the end of all things,

77
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,040
 it makes everything that happens now

78
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,120
 come in to the right focus.

79
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,400
 I don't know about you, but I'm the sort of person

80
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,680
 that actually enjoys watching a movie

81
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,360
 the second time more than the first time.

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,840
 Is anyone else like that?

83
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,040
 Like when I watch a movie for the first time,

84
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
 I have no idea how that movie's going to end.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,680
 And of course that creates an excitement

86
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,840
 when you're watching it, you're wondering

87
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,640
 how it's all gonna turn out at the end,

88
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,080
 but it also, at least for me,

89
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,800
 creates a little bit of anxiety.

90
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,840
 I don't know how this is all gonna play out,

91
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,200
 and I don't know if it's gonna end

92
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,960
 in a way that I'm gonna be happy with.

93
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,240
 Will it all resolve?

94
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,560
 Will I leave the theater at the end of watching the movie

95
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,040
 feeling like all my expectations were met?

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,280
 And so when I watch a movie for the first time,

97
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,600
 I'm kind of excited, I'm kind of nervous,

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,280
 I don't know how it's gonna turn out.

99
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,360
 When I watch it the second time, I know how it ends.

100
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,200
 And because I know how it ends, it informs so much

101
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,800
 of how I watch it for that second, third, fourth,

102
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,040
 or fifth time.

103
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,120
 It's fascinating to me that when I know

104
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,360
 how the movie's gonna end and resolve itself,

105
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,080
 I actually enjoy it so much more.

106
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,840
 And I get to see all the little nuances

107
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,600
 that I missed the first time I watched it.

108
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,780
 All those little things that the director included

109
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,600
 about characterizations and conversations

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,200
 and little plot turns and twists

111
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,960
 that actually when you've seen it before,

112
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,080
 you watch it and you go, ah, I know what that's really about.

113
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,040
 Oh, I know what's gonna happen to that character

114
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,200
 later on, right?

115
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,400
 And it brings this whole different perspective

116
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,920
 to the movie as a whole.

117
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,960
 I found for me when I watch a movie a second or third time,

118
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,800
 when I know how it ends, I actually find more purpose

119
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,480
 and joy in the journey itself.

120
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,860
 And I think it's exactly the same for the Bible,

121
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,520
 for our scriptures.

122
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,160
 I wonder if you've ever wondered why the Bible

123
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,320
 doesn't finish with the letters of the New Testament,

124
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,480
 these incredible letters that the writers write

125
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,080
 about how to live now in the reality of the life,

126
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,720
 death and resurrection of Jesus

127
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,000
 and letters that were written by the apostles

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,800
 into the churches to help them to understand

129
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,280
 what life is like now because of all that.

130
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,140
 Why didn't the Bible just finish with those letters?

131
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,360
 No, it doesn't.

132
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,960
 The Bible actually finishes with this crazy revelation

133
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,360
 that God gives John on the island of Patmos

134
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,420
 where he sees this apocalyptic vision

135
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,000
 of what the end of the world is going to be like.

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,960
 And he writes down all these crazy imageries

137
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,080
 and all these things that he senses God has given him.

138
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,200
 And right at the end of that book

139
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,320
 in chapters 21 and 22 of Revelations,

140
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,920
 John shows us what our end of the movie is like.

141
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,400
 And he paints this beautiful picture

142
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,880
 of how all the world is gonna be made new

143
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,520
 under this new Jerusalem that comes down to earth.

144
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,860
 And he shows us this picture of a new city coming down

145
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,200
 from heaven to earth, fulfilling Jesus's prayer

146
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
 when the disciples said, "How should we pray?"

147
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,160
 He says, "Pray that heaven will come to earth."

148
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,840
 And we see in Revelation 21 and 22

149
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,760
 that that's exactly what happens.

150
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,400
 Heaven literally comes to earth in this new city.

151
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,200
 And we find Jesus in the fullness of his presence

152
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,240
 living for all eternity in that city.

153
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,620
 And not only that, but in those last chapters,

154
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,880
 we see that every tribe and every tongue,

155
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,440
 every race and every background

156
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,480
 is there in unity together, praising God.

157
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,360
 And not only that, but because God is there in his fullness,

158
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,940
 we suddenly see the end of poverty,

159
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,560
 the end of pain, the end of suffering,

160
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,080
 the end of need for anything other

161
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,060
 than the incredible presence of God.

162
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,520
 We see the end of sin, literally,

163
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,800
 and therefore the end of death.

164
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,400
 And all that is in this city is a river that flows,

165
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,880
 a river of life.

166
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,160
 And there are trees on either side of this river

167
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,340
 and there are leaves for the healing of the nation

168
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,440
 and everybody who's a part of this city

169
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,320
 knows for the final time for the rest of their lives,

170
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,160
 the fullness of Shalom,

171
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,040
 what the peace of the Lord is all about.

172
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,220
 It's a glorious vision.

173
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,920
 And the Bible finishes on that vision.

174
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,640
 It's almost like God is peeling the curtain back

175
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,800
 and going, "Hey, this is how the movie ends."

176
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,360
 And in the same way that I enjoy movies so much more

177
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,240
 when I know how they're gonna end,

178
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,300
 'cause I can find more purpose in my joy of watching it,

179
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,900
 so I think God pulls the curtain back

180
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,980
 and shows us the end of all things,

181
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,900
 shows us Christ returning so that we can find more purpose

182
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,480
 and joy in how we live today.

183
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,300
 That, my friends, is Advent.

184
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,720
 That is the joy of this season.

185
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,300
 You see, the way we live today is not just informed

186
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,180
 by what we read in the Gospels.

187
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,740
 As important as the Gospels are,

188
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,220
 it's not just informed by what we see in the life

189
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,820
 and the death and the resurrection of Jesus.

190
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,540
 Actually, the Bible presents to us

191
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,780
 another way of understanding how to live today.

192
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,080
 It's done by seeing what is gonna happen

193
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,180
 at the end of all things

194
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,700
 and wanting to live on behalf of that vision today,

195
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,020
 saying, "If this is the future that we're heading into,

196
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,020
 "then how can I live today with purpose,

197
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,240
 "with promise that gives honor to the future

198
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,320
 "that God is gonna bring to all of creation?"

199
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,860
 So listen to this, church.

200
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,460
 Anytime that you fight for justice today,

201
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,580
 anytime you care for the poor, you give to the needy,

202
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,740
 you walk with the broken, you stand for the abused,

203
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,380
 you help the vulnerable,

204
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,100
 anytime that you liberate the oppressed,

205
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,820
 anytime that you find yourself being a voice of peace

206
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,580
 and collaboration and unity amongst people

207
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,980
 that don't like each other,

208
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,780
 you're beginning to live as if God's future is now.

209
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,740
 You're beginning to stand in such a way

210
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,260
 that you say, "Advent matters.

211
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,940
 "This longing that I have inside of me

212
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,740
 "for the coming of Christ again,

213
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,800
 "I can begin to show the world

214
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,540
 "what that place will look like."

215
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,380
 We can't create it now,

216
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,580
 but we can begin to prophetically live in such a way

217
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,260
 that people would say, "That's a future

218
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,780
 "I wanna be a part of."

219
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,740
 Oh, I'm getting excited.

220
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,820
 You're not, but I am, that's okay.

221
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,900
 (congregation laughing)

222
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,380
 That's because we wanna live

223
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,100
 on behalf of this grand vision today.

224
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,500
 This, my friends, is Advent.

225
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,740
 Not only the celebration of a Savior

226
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,500
 who stepped into the world as a child,

227
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,740
 but also the longing for the future arrival of a Savior

228
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,060
 who will step back into the world as a king,

229
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,260
 and then living on behalf of both of those realities today.

230
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,060
 That is Christmas.

231
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,700
 Christmas is so much more

232
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,540
 than just the reality of Jesus coming as this child.

233
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,060
 Christmas opens up for us a much bigger, wider,

234
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,180
 larger, redemptive narrative

235
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,660
 that when we celebrate

236
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,700
 in what has been pulled back from that curtain,

237
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,900
 and we know how the movie ends,

238
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,740
 and we live on behalf of both the birth

239
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,980
 and the return of Christ,

240
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,900
 we begin to show the world something different.

241
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,380
 Christmas should be the most transformative season

242
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,820
 in the life of the church than any season,

243
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,300
 because it is Christmas that our story begins

244
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,740
 and leads us towards its ultimate culmination.

245
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,540
 So it shouldn't surprise us

246
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,940
 that when the New Testament writers

247
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,460
 are writing about the life and the death

248
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,420
 and resurrection of Christ,

249
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,980
 and when they're writing the letters to the churches

250
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,300
 to encourage them,

251
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,660
 that there's this growing sense among the early church

252
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,740
 that they're desperate for the story

253
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,180
 to have its completion,

254
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,380
 that they're desperate for Christ to return.

255
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,340
 And so the New Testament is filled

256
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,420
 with all of these different speeches

257
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,980
 and ideas and writings about this return of Christ.

258
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,420
 There's a longing in the early church

259
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,380
 that Jesus would come back,

260
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,020
 because they realize that despite the fact

261
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,900
 that Jesus has been here in his life,

262
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,300
 death, and resurrection,

263
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,020
 despite the fact of his ascension

264
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,980
 and the sending of the Holy Spirit,

265
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,140
 there's still something that's unfinished in the story,

266
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,620
 not unfinished in the idea of salvation.

267
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,140
 It's important that you get this.

268
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,700
 See, salvation has been received to us in its fullness

269
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,620
 in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

270
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,740
 Sin is conquered, sin has been overcome,

271
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,020
 and anybody who gives their life to Jesus

272
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,860
 and asks for the forgiveness of their sins

273
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,100
 is fully saved by him.

274
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,660
 Yet we also realize, don't we,

275
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,940
 that there's still an influence of sin on our lives.

276
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,780
 There's still an influence of sin in the world around us.

277
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,580
 And you see, the early church felt this.

278
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,820
 They saw the profundity and the power of salvation

279
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,900
 here in its fullness,

280
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,860
 and yet they recognized that there was still

281
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,900
 so much brokenness, sometimes within them,

282
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,820
 and a lot of times within their world.

283
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,380
 And they therefore cried out,

284
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,100
 Lord, if you could just return

285
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,780
 and do what you have promised that you will do,

286
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,540
 everything will find its rightful place.

287
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,260
 This is why right at the end of our scriptures,

288
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,700
 literally the very last thing that's written

289
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,740
 at the end of the Bible in Revelations 22,

290
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,340
 starting in verse 20, it says this.

291
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,020
 "He who testifies to these things says,"

292
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,340
 this is Jesus speaking, "Yes, I am coming soon.

293
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,780
 "Amen, come, Lord Jesus."

294
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,100
 Our Bibles finish on this incredible prayer,

295
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,340
 Maranatha it is in its original text,

296
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,020
 which means come, Lord Jesus.

297
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,340
 And if you were here last week,

298
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,380
 you'll remember this is not the come, Lord Jesus

299
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,980
 in the sense that right now,

300
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,780
 we don't have enough of your presence.

301
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,900
 We said last week, right,

302
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,260
 that the fullness of the presence of God is in us

303
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,340
 as we come to relationship with Christ.

304
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,660
 The fullness of the presence of God is in this world

305
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,220
 in its omnipotence.

306
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,460
 This is not a crying out for more of some sort

307
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,180
 of momentary infilling.

308
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,860
 This Maranatha, come, Lord Jesus,

309
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,700
 is a crying out for Christ to return,

310
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,780
 crying out for that Revelation 21, 22 picture

311
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,580
 so that the world would know the shalom

312
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,140
 that God has always promised it.

313
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,780
 This is the church saying, we are not satisfied.

314
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,980
 There is more.

315
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,460
 I love this idea because when the New Testament writers

316
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,460
 write about this, they understand that the world

317
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,900
 is still not quite as God desires it to be.

318
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,260
 And this fueled their evangelism.

319
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,100
 This fueled their compassion.

320
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,460
 This is why they were just and hopeful.

321
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,740
 This is why they spoke into all areas

322
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,740
 of the Greek Roman society.

323
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,060
 This is why the gospel went out from Jerusalem,

324
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,540
 Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the world

325
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,900
 because they realized that they had a role to play,

326
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,980
 that because Christ is coming back,

327
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,660
 because there is the river of life,

328
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,380
 because sin will be gone, because all the nations

329
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,020
 will come together and worship God,

330
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,460
 there is work to do today.

331
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,180
 So if Christmas is anything for us,

332
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,580
 if Advent is anything for us,

333
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,100
 it should be the most mobilizing season

334
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,180
 that the church experiences.

335
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,980
 It should light a fire inside of us to say,

336
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,020
 there's a story that needs to be told to this world

337
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,460
 because right now we're sitting between these two bookends.

338
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,340
 He's come, He is coming.

339
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,300
 And we're in this moment,

340
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,140
 which is one of the most precious moments of history

341
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:28,140
 where we've seen Him, we know Him, and He will come again.

342
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,380
 The New Testament and scholars,

343
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,780
 as they've studied the scriptures,

344
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,220
 they've coined this term that we all live in

345
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,980
 as this idea of the now but not yet.

346
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,140
 It's an academic term, but it's helpful, I think.

347
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,420
 The now but not yet is the season that we're in.

348
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,420
 The now but not yet is the longing and the cry of Advent.

349
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,740
 Now in the sense that Christ has come,

350
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,980
 and as Carla shared during our communion time,

351
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,540
 was on the cross and said those words, it is finished.

352
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,700
 That the wages of sin are death,

353
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,700
 but because of Christ and His resurrection,

354
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,500
 those wages have been paid for.

355
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,420
 We now know the fullness of life in relation to Him.

356
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,460
 It is done, that's the now.

357
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,260
 But yet there is this not yet.

358
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,260
 There is the reality that sin is still at work,

359
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,100
 there is this reality

360
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,820
 that we still see brokenness in the world.

361
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,740
 There is this reality that people still suffer,

362
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,460
 that there is still death,

363
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,420
 and that longing inside of us for that reality

364
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,940
 that we see at the end of Revelation 21 and 22,

365
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,740
 and that glorious picture of the return of Christ.

366
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,140
 That sits on our hearts together as well.

367
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,780
 And so we're in the now, we're in this not yet,

368
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,700
 and as we sit in the middle of that,

369
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,820
 that's where we find Advent.

370
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,340
 That's where the Maranatha cries from our spirit.

371
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:55,500
 Come, Lord Jesus, 'cause I wanna see my family revived.

372
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,180
 Come, Lord Jesus, 'cause I wanna see my businesses.

373
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,580
 I wanna see the workplace.

374
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,900
 I wanna see everybody that I know know you.

375
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,260
 Come, Lord Jesus.

376
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,700
 This is the crazy thing about the now but not yet.

377
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,500
 Christ is coming again.

378
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,860
 And because he's coming again,

379
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,820
 that should change everything now.

380
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,220
 There's so many ways of thinking about this in Scripture,

381
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,220
 but I wanna read you one of the passages

382
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,820
 that I find most helpful,

383
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,140
 particularly when it comes to the idea

384
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,980
 of Christmas and Advent.

385
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,580
 And this is found in Paul's writings

386
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,940
 in 1 Corinthians 13.

387
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,340
 And if you're just journeying

388
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,460
 or beginning your journey of faith here,

389
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,380
 maybe this passage is well-known to you

390
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,860
 just from the weddings you've attended.

391
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,060
 It's often the passage that's read at weddings.

392
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,420
 If you've been a Christian here for many years,

393
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,540
 you'll know this passage.

394
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,740
 The first seven verses are this beautiful chorus about love,

395
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,860
 and it's one of the most celebrated sections

396
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,260
 of Scripture that we have.

397
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,380
 But I wanna read the following verses

398
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,460
 after those first seven.

399
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,820
 This is verses eight to 13.

400
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,540
 And in these verses, we see a slightly different story.

401
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,980
 In fact, Paul goes from this glorious idea of what love is

402
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,060
 to the reality of the now but not yet time

403
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,380
 that we're living in.

404
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,660
 And when you read them, it feels a little bit jarring,

405
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,820
 but when you open up what Paul's trying to say,

406
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
 everything begins to fit together.

407
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,540
 These verses I'm about to read, if you will,

408
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,380
 if you're here and you have an older sibling,

409
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,140
 and this happens quite a lot in our culture in Asia,

410
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,340
 if you've got an older sibling

411
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,660
 and your parents think that the sun shines out of them

412
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,740
 all the time, and you've always felt like

413
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,880
 you're in the shadow of your older sibling,

414
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,340
 then you'll resonate with these verses, okay?

415
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,700
 'Cause these verses are in the shadow

416
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,460
 of that amazing section on love,

417
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,060
 but there is so much wonder here.

418
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,260
 Let me read this to you.

419
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,340
 1 Corinthians 13, starting in verse eight.

420
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,500
 Love never fails, but where there are prophecies,

421
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,900
 they will cease.

422
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,100
 Where there are tongues, they will be stilled.

423
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,020
 Where there is knowledge, it will pass away.

424
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,380
 Notice this, for we know in part and we prophesy in part.

425
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,720
 But then he says this, but when perfection comes,

426
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,820
 the imperfect disappears.

427
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,660
 You see, when I was a child, I taught like a child,

428
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,260
 I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child,

429
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,340
 but when I became a man,

430
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,320
 I put these childish ways behind me.

431
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,700
 Now we see, but a poor reflection as in a mirror,

432
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,940
 then we will see face to face.

433
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,220
 Now I know in part, then I shall know fully,

434
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,940
 even as I am fully known.

435
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,740
 And these three things remain, faith, hope, and love.

436
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,140
 But the greatest of these is love.

437
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,760
 I love how Paul begins this,

438
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,820
 this whole section he's speaking about the now,

439
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,860
 but not yet tension of how Christ has come,

440
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,100
 and yet we long for him to come again.

441
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,340
 Look at what he says at the start.

442
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,260
 He says, love never fails,

443
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,280
 but where there are prophecies, they will cease.

444
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,040
 Where there is tongues, they will be stilled.

445
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,640
 Where there is knowledge, it's gonna pass away.

446
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,340
 For we know in part, we prophesy in part,

447
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,660
 but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.

448
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,420
 He's saying this, look, we need to understand

449
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,220
 that we're longing for a time where perfection comes.

450
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,420
 He's speaking there metaphorically

451
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,980
 about the return of Jesus.

452
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,200
 And when perfection comes, all this imperfect stuff

453
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,080
 that we're feeling right now, it disappears.

454
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
 And he names some really amazing things.

455
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,520
 He talks about prophecy,

456
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,680
 and he talks about wisdom and knowledge,

457
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,040
 but he says, you need to understand

458
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,680
 that even in the prophetic,

459
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,280
 even in the wisdom and the knowledge,

460
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,320
 we only prophesy and we only know in part.

461
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,480
 We don't know everything he's saying to the church.

462
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,280
 We can't because we're in this now, but not yet.

463
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,040
 There's a longing and there's a crying out

464
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,740
 because we don't have all the answers,

465
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,300
 that there are these gaps.

466
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,720
 We don't know it all he's saying.

467
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,720
 But when perfection comes, everything that's imperfect,

468
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,800
 even all the lack of knowledge and all that goes

469
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,560
 because suddenly perfection is with us.

470
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,640
 He comments again, let me read this to you in verse 12.

471
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,760
 He says it this way.

472
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,840
 He says, "Now, in this time of now, but not yet,

473
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,480
 "we see, but a poor reflection is in a mirror.

474
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,320
 "But then when Christ returns, we will see face to face.

475
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,700
 "Now I only know in part, then I shall know fully,

476
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,900
 "even though right now I am fully known."

477
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,100
 This is so profound.

478
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,860
 I want you to remember, this is Paul writing to his church.

479
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,500
 Paul, who previously was the Hebrew of Hebrews,

480
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,620
 was one of the most learned people

481
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,100
 in the Jewish religion of his day.

482
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,340
 He prided himself on the knowledge of scripture

483
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,500
 and the knowledge of understanding of who God is,

484
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,780
 his character and his life.

485
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,820
 That was what he celebrated.

486
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,980
 And he has the humility now,

487
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,920
 now that he's come into relationship with Jesus,

488
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,700
 now he's come to understand the birth

489
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,380
 and yet the second coming.

490
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,020
 Now he's come to realize the now, but not yet

491
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,860
 that he's sitting in.

492
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,020
 He has the humility to write to his church

493
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,700
 and says, "I know only in part."

494
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,180
 I don't have it all figured out.

495
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,320
 I love this.

496
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,260
 This frees me as a pastor, 'cause I can stand before you

497
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,180
 and say, "I don't have it all figured out."

498
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,900
 'Cause if the apostle Paul didn't have it figured out,

499
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,180
 I don't have it figured out either.

500
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,020
 He writes to his church.

501
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,540
 Now remember, 1 Corinthians is a letter Paul's writing

502
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,180
 in reply to another letter that Paul's written,

503
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,000
 sorry, that the church wrote Paul.

504
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,140
 We don't have a copy of that letter,

505
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,780
 but the letter that the church wrote Paul

506
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,540
 had a list of all these questions in it for him.

507
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,660
 And in 1 Corinthians 13,

508
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,660
 he does try to answer some of those questions.

509
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,820
 But then in this section, he says,

510
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,500
 "But you need to understand, church,

511
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,660
 "even though I'll do my best to give you some wisdom here,

512
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,120
 "we only prophesy in part.

513
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,740
 "We only are wise in part.

514
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,060
 "I don't know it all," he's saying.

515
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,820
 In other words, there are going to,

516
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,100
 in this now but not yet season,

517
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,500
 there's going to be gaps, gaps in our knowledge,

518
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,880
 gaps in our prophecy, gaps in our understanding,

519
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,820
 gaps in our vision.

520
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,420
 We're not gonna have it all sorted out.

521
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,980
 But then he says this, "One day when he returns,

522
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,620
 "we will see face to face,

523
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,860
 "and in that moment, I will know it all.

524
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,700
 "But right now, I don't."

525
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,060
 But then he says this crazy thing.

526
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,280
 He goes this, he's kinda like,

527
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,480
 I almost feel like as he's writing this,

528
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,960
 he leans into the church.

529
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,120
 He leans in and goes, "But guess what?

530
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,700
 "I know one who does know it all.

531
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,540
 "'Cause although right now, I don't have all the answers.

532
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,860
 "Although right now, there are gaps for me,

533
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,200
 "there is one that I know who is coming back.

534
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,000
 "And when he comes back, we're all gonna know.

535
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,140
 "But right now, even though I don't know everything,

536
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,000
 "he right now knows everything.

537
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,620
 "He right now has all the answers.

538
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,700
 "He right now can step in and show himself to his fullness.

539
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,120
 "I may be seeing in a mirror slightly darkly.

540
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,380
 "There's no filter for God," he's saying to the church.

541
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,260
 "There's no break for him.

542
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,780
 "He sees everything fully right now."

543
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,980
 And it's almost like Paul is saying,

544
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,020
 it is okay for me not to know everything,

545
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,620
 because I know the one who does.

546
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,740
 Okay, let me break this down for you a little bit more,

547
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,860
 'cause I wanna show you really the beauty of this,

548
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,060
 and then show you how this links into Advent.

549
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,500
 Has this been helping so far?

550
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,460
 I'm glad I came back.

551
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,860
 (congregation laughing)

552
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,220
 I'm just gonna go back to Spain.

553
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,620
 Walk another 800, no, okay.

554
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:06,500
 All right, so I apologize up front for my writing,

555
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,580
 but follow this, okay.

556
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,620
 Here's what Paul is saying in 1 Corinthians 13.

557
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,100
 He's basically going, look, he's like,

558
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,260
 there is this world right now that we all know,

559
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,460
 and this world is kinda messed up.

560
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,460
 The word he uses, he says, it's imperfect, right?

561
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,140
 There's this imperfection that's happening right now

562
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,500
 in our world, but then he says,

563
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,300
 you also need to understand that there's this world

564
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,500
 that's coming when Christ returns.

565
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,180
 This is gonna look like a sun, but it's not.

566
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,660
 It's the amazing, redeemed, and renewed world

567
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,620
 that Christ is in the center of.

568
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,660
 And he says, this world, this time, is perfect.

569
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,260
 So right now, he's saying, we know imperfection

570
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,740
 in the future when Christ returns,

571
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,260
 everything will be perfect.

572
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,540
 And he's basically saying, we live right now

573
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,860
 in this now, but not yet tension

574
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,740
 between these two times.

575
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,580
 This is the lot for every human being right now.

576
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,900
 We're sitting in between the imperfect that we know,

577
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,060
 the fact that I don't know it all,

578
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,380
 that there are gaps for me,

579
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,700
 and this perfect return of Christ that's gonna happen.

580
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,740
 And he basically says, you need to understand

581
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,180
 that there, in this time, there are gaps.

582
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,700
 There are gaps for all of us, Paul is saying.

583
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,740
 And the reason why he's trying to teach his church this,

584
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,940
 the reason why I'm trying to teach you it here this morning

585
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,820
 is because it's actually in these gaps

586
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,220
 where Advent is found.

587
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,860
 Let me explain that.

588
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
 If you're anything like me, and I'm sure you are,

589
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,420
 we don't like the gaps.

590
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,620
 The gaps during the now, but not yet time

591
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,260
 are the hardest things about this time.

592
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,100
 I don't know about you,

593
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,260
 but I wish I did have all the answers.

594
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,860
 But there are gaps, and there are gaps in our lives.

595
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,260
 Things happen that we have no control of.

596
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,220
 Something takes place in our work that we can't explain.

597
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,620
 There's a breakdown in a relationship, and it's hurt us.

598
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,100
 There are wounds that we're carrying

599
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,900
 that we don't seem to get healed from.

600
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,300
 There are questions that we're holding on our hearts

601
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,220
 that don't seem to get answered.

602
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,260
 There's stuff that we've been doing with God

603
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,820
 that we thought would bring a breakthrough

604
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,540
 doesn't seem to be a breakthrough.

605
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,580
 There are gaps, Paul is saying,

606
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,660
 between the time of the imperfect

607
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,500
 and this perfection that will come.

608
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,700
 But we so as human beings don't like the gaps

609
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,580
 that here's what we do in the gaps.

610
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,220
 We try to fill them with ourselves.

611
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,380
 We try to look within ourselves to try to fill the gaps.

612
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,060
 In other words, we want to control

613
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,900
 what Paul is saying here is uncontrollable.

614
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,900
 We wanna try to fill those gaps.

615
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,460
 So for example, I don't know, Lord,

616
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,860
 when I'm gonna get a job, how am I gonna get a job?

617
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,940
 And we try our very best and we get so stressed

618
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,500
 of trying to work things out.

619
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,420
 Or I don't know, Lord, how I'm gonna save my marriage

620
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,940
 and we're trying our best, but we can't sort it all out.

621
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,100
 We work really hard and we get ourselves

622
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,180
 into places of worry, anxiety, stress, depression,

623
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,300
 because there are gaps, we don't like gaps,

624
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,460
 and we're trying to fill the gaps with ourselves.

625
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,980
 Are you with me?

626
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,500
 And what Paul's writing to the church is,

627
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,580
 no, you gotta understand, we live in the now but not yet.

628
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,220
 This is the cry of Advent.

629
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,700
 You wanna know what Advent is?

630
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,140
 Advent is standing in the gap

631
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,260
 and not trying to solve it yourself.

632
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,060
 Advent is standing in the gap and crying out and going,

633
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,340
 I know in part, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure.

634
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,580
 What it means is that I know the one who knows it all.

635
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,660
 The gap is where the carol comes.

636
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,660
 Oh come, oh come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel

637
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:45,180
 who mourn in lonely exile here in the gap,

638
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,180
 waiting until the Son of God appears.

639
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:54,580
 Maranatha, come Lord Jesus, is not an escapism.

640
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,620
 It's not some sort of whimsical idea.

641
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,020
 It is the cry of those that live in the gaps

642
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,700
 who are saying I know and trust and believe

643
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,700
 that there is one who can set all things right.

644
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,900
 The gaps are an opportunity, yes,

645
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,620
 for us to potentially worry and get stressed

646
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,100
 and overwhelmed and depressed,

647
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,500
 but the gaps are also one of the most profound invitations

648
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,660
 you will ever have to a greater relationship with God.

649
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:27,900
 Could it be that God has given us this now but not yet time

650
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,920
 and given us these gaps that we like to try to control

651
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,980
 and fill so that we can't control and fill them,

652
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,500
 but instead discover Him?

653
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,400
 That, my friends, I believe, is what Christmas is all about.

654
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,140
 It's what Advent is.

655
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,280
 And here's the crazy thing.

656
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,420
 Paul goes, and you know what?

657
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,700
 God in His mercy hasn't left us alone

658
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,700
 trying to maybe some people might be able

659
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,740
 to work this out, some won't.

660
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,940
 He says there's actually three things that God has given us

661
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,280
 that are values, vehicles, ways in which we can reach out

662
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,520
 beyond ourselves towards Him who knows it all.

663
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,880
 Verse 13, and now these three things remain,

664
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,120
 faith, hope, and love.

665
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,720
 The greatest of these, he says, is love.

666
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,040
 This is Paul basically saying you've gotta understand

667
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,480
 something that's really, really important here.

668
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,720
 He said in the place of these gaps, there is faith,

669
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,600
 there is faith, there is hope, there is love.

670
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,960
 We may not have all the answers,

671
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,660
 we may not be able to always get all the answers,

672
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,940
 but it is not that God stands back,

673
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,140
 looks at our gaps in our lives, and goes,

674
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,040
 (laughing)

675
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,540
 Paul's saying, no, no, we're not alone in the gaps.

676
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,580
 We have the gaps.

677
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,420
 I don't know it all, He knows it all.

678
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,620
 One day I will know it all.

679
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,060
 When He comes back, I hope He comes back soon,

680
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,660
 but in this moment, He's deposited by His Spirit

681
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,260
 and by His church and in His Word three things

682
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,740
 that enable me not to have all the answers,

683
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,020
 but enable me to reach out of myself and towards Him,

684
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,820
 enable the gaps to become a place of advent,

685
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,980
 of longing, of wishing, of hoping for the arrival of God.

686
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,460
 Faith inside of me that believes

687
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,100
 that He wasn't just born in that manger as a child,

688
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,140
 but He will come back, and that the curtain

689
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,620
 that is being pulled back in Revelation 21 and 22

690
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,460
 is not just some fantastic idea,

691
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,500
 it's the literal thing that will happen

692
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,580
 at the end of all things.

693
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,620
 Hope, hope that that story is part of my story.

694
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,860
 Hope that even when I feel a long way away from the coming,

695
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,820
 I can trust that God will do what He says He's gonna do.

696
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,100
 Love, love that so fills me and changes me,

697
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,580
 that because I know He was born, I know He's coming back,

698
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,900
 and I know He's here in the fullness

699
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,780
 in His presence right now, I have a place to know

700
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,420
 and feel and encounter love, and because He first loved me,

701
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,380
 I can now love.

702
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,700
 That's why this is the greatest of the three,

703
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,780
 because I now can walk in the love of Christ

704
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,020
 to all those around me, and if I really want to advent well,

705
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,740
 then it's found in how I love true and well.

706
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,980
 Faith, hope, and love.

707
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,900
 Paul says this is it, and I think that's

708
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,980
 the most beautiful summary of what advent is all about.

709
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,380
 This bookends of Christ's redemptive story

710
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,180
 that welcomes us in to the reality that there are gaps, yes,

711
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,140
 and that those gaps are hard and uncomfortable, yes,

712
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:40,820
 but those gaps can lead us to the one who knows it all.

713
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,620
 If there's not a better message for Christmas,

714
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,300
 then I don't know what there is,

715
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,420
 and my prayer is that you will go

716
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,140
 into your workplace tomorrow and go,

717
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,940
 let me tell you about the bookends,

718
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,300
 because now I know about the bookends.

719
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,180
 Let me tell you about the gaps.

720
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,180
 You've got a gap, I've got a gap.

721
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,700
 We've all got gaps, but those gaps

722
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,980
 don't have to be the end for you.

723
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,220
 They're not the end for me, and although maybe

724
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,580
 those gaps don't get answered the way

725
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,740
 I think they're gonna get answered,

726
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,500
 those gaps are an invitation to find the God of the gaps.

727
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:12,580
 So here's what I wanna encourage you to do this week.

728
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,940
 I wanna help you to just reframe some things in your mind,

729
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,300
 to find that longing inside of you

730
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,980
 that is what advent is all about,

731
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,660
 and over the next three Sundays,

732
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,940
 we're gonna take faith, hope, and love,

733
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,900
 and we're gonna use these three themes

734
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,740
 as the center point for understanding

735
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,220
 both the birth of Christ, 'cause those three things,

736
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,340
 faith, hope, and love, are framed in the birth of Christ,

737
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,500
 and then see how they are framed in his second coming,

738
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,580
 and as we do that, I pray that you will encounter

739
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,580
 more faith and hope and love in the now,

740
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,260
 but not yet in between.

741
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,140
 So to get you prepared for that,

742
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,580
 here's a little exercise I want you to do this week,

743
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,380
 and by the way, when I say I want you to do it,

744
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,940
 I actually mean that I want you to do it.

745
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,340
 I don't want you just to take a photo of the slide

746
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,180
 and go, "That was a nice sermon today."

747
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,820
 I actually want you to do it,

748
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,660
 because I think it can help change your heart

749
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,140
 and get you ready for advent.

750
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,340
 So I'm gonna kinda get out of the way,

751
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,020
 and you can take a photo of this next slide,

752
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,860
 but let me read you these four reflections

753
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,340
 I want you to think about this week.

754
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,440
 Where and what are the gaps in this now,

755
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,780
 but not yet time that overwhelm me or overwhelm you?

756
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,000
 What are some of the longings that sit within you

757
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,240
 that are far beyond your own ability to achieve?

758
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,820
 Where do you see in your own life

759
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,020
 the tension between the fullness of salvation received,

760
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,900
 and yet the reality of the ongoing work of sin?

761
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,180
 Okay, that's a very personal one for you.

762
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,680
 What burdens do you carry for yourself,

763
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,260
 others, or this world

764
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,540
 that burn a righteous justice within you?

765
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,980
 That's the positive thing.

766
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,140
 That's the, "Hey, let's fight for injustice now.

767
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,100
 "Let's make this work.

768
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,860
 "Let's stand for the poor and the needy."

769
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,480
 What burdens sit within you

770
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,900
 that are like a cry of your heart to help those around you?

771
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,740
 That's the cry of advent.

772
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,660
 In the same way, what sin still overwhelms me at time

773
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,040
 and seems to have a grip on me,

774
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,660
 even though I know it's fully paid for,

775
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,980
 but it still seems to have a grip on me,

776
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,100
 the honesty of that, that's also advent.

777
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,700
 So it's this beautiful reflection

778
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,580
 that we can find in ourselves

779
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,420
 that helps to trigger our understanding

780
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,880
 of where we're at as we enter into this Christmas season,

781
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,500
 where we look at both the birth

782
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,700
 and the return of our Savior.

783
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,340
 Does that sound helpful to you?

784
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,700
 All right, can we just pray together?

785
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,520
 Let's pray.

786
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,740
 Father, as we enter into the season of advent

787
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,580
 here at The Vine,

788
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,900
 and as we focus on faith, hope, and love in the weeks ahead,

789
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,860
 as we celebrate your birth,

790
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,000
 understand this longing we should have for your return,

791
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,900
 putting those two things into balance

792
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,260
 as bookends around your redemptive story,

793
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,020
 and as we find ourselves as Paul

794
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,560
 has so beautifully shown us this morning,

795
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,980
 the gaps that are there,

796
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,420
 and yet the liberation we can have from fear,

797
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,700
 anxiety, worry, depression, from not knowing it all,

798
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,780
 and instead the gaps being a springboard,

799
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,700
 a catalyst towards greater trust, faith, hope, love with you.

800
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,580
 Father, that's my prayer for every person here at The Vine

801
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,620
 and everybody watching online in this moment.

802
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,860
 My prayer is that they would find themselves

803
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,800
 catalyzed at advent this year,

804
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,140
 to find that longing inside of them,

805
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:30,120
 the crying out within them for the Son of God to appear,

806
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,060
 that the gaps that they are very aware of

807
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,300
 in their lives right now,

808
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,300
 where anxiety and fear and worry

809
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,940
 has been the thing that has driven their sense of the need

810
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,540
 to control the gaps in their lives.

811
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,780
 I wanna pray for releasing right now in the name of Jesus.

812
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,340
 I wanna pray that this advent season

813
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,260
 will be a shift for many in this room,

814
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,060
 for many watching online.

815
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,060
 I believe that where the gaps have created anxiety,

816
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,760
 the gaps are now gonna create faith in the name of Jesus.

817
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,000
 The gaps are now gonna birth hope in their hearts

818
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,500
 in the name of Jesus.

819
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,960
 The gaps are gonna create a deeper love for you

820
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,360
 and for others around them in the name of Jesus.

821
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,980
 What the enemy has stolen from the gaps.

822
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,020
 Lord, I pray that you would recatalyze

823
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,140
 by your spirit amongst the vine over the next three weeks.

824
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,980
 Lord, I pray that you would light that advent fire in us,

825
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,060
 that we would look forward to celebrating your birth

826
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,200
 in the manger of Bethlehem that night,

827
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,500
 but we would also long for your return as a reigning king.

828
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,400
 And that would fuel and drive our purpose and our ministry

829
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,100
 and our sharing of the gospel with our friends and family

830
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,780
 of all the action that you're calling us to do.

831
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,940
 And it would more than anything catalyze the gaps.

832
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,700
 Where we say like Paul would humble himself

833
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,500
 before his church and say, I don't have all the answers,

834
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,740
 but I know the one who does.

835
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,140
 And Lord, if there's anyone in this room

836
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,580
 or watching online right now,

837
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,800
 where they would say they don't know that God.

838
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,860
 Father, I wanna pray that this moment right here

839
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,500
 and the moments over advent as we lead up

840
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,300
 to the celebration of the birth of Jesus

841
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,820
 would be a birthing moment for them.

842
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,460
 Your scriptures speak about a new birth,

843
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,140
 that we become a new creation in you

844
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,220
 when we come into relationship with you.

845
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,320
 So Lord, I wanna pray anyone in this room,

846
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,020
 maybe they've been invited here today

847
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,580
 by a friend or a family member.

848
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,300
 And maybe as they think about Christmas,

849
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,260
 they've always wondered what's this really about?

850
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,220
 Is it just about buying things?

851
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,220
 Is it just commercial?

852
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,060
 Is it just material?

853
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,420
 And they're here today realizing

854
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,140
 that it's about a much bigger story,

855
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,340
 a story that they're swept up in,

856
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,980
 that they are caught up in.

857
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,100
 And if you're sitting here right now

858
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,020
 and you don't know Jesus,

859
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,140
 you are caught up in this crazy story,

860
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,880
 whether you realize it or not.

861
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,860
 And the Bible tells us that Christ is returning

862
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,160
 and that we will see him one day face to face.

863
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,420
 My prayer for you is that you,

864
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,060
 as you face him face to face,

865
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,380
 he would say to you, well done,

866
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,500
 my good and faithful son or daughter,

867
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,900
 my good and faithful child.

868
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,540
 And he will welcome you into that incredible city

869
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,540
 where for all eternity,

870
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,020
 you will be able to spend with him.

871
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,140
 And so I wanna pray just as our eyes are closed,

872
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,780
 heads are bowed,

873
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,820
 if anyone in this room,

874
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,020
 that's your desire today.

875
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,020
 You've heard what we've been talking about today

876
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,060
 and you're like, you know what?

877
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,780
 I realize that the gaps in my life

878
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,820
 are causing more anxiety in me than I would need.

879
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,060
 And I want the gaps to be filled with something else.

880
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,260
 I want that faith,

881
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,140
 that hope and that love that Andrew was speaking about.

882
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,740
 Well, I want you to know that that's available to you

883
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,780
 right in this moment.

884
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,740
 And while the journey of being a Christian

885
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,740
 is a lifelong journey,

886
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,740
 it begins with a simple prayer.

887
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,260
 It's a prayer that just acknowledges

888
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,940
 that you know what the gaps are like,

889
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,260
 acknowledges that you have been living in those gaps,

890
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,740
 that you don't have all the answers,

891
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,460
 that there is sin and brokenness in your life.

892
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,380
 And that prayer is a simple acknowledgement

893
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,980
 that there is one who is perfect,

894
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,620
 one who is full of love,

895
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:17,140
 one who can save you from that brokenness within.

896
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,700
 And so if that's you,

897
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,540
 I'm just gonna invite you now

898
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,540
 as all of our eyes are closed,

899
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,180
 I'm just gonna invite you to pray.

900
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,380
 And in fact, we're all gonna pray together,

901
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,940
 but if this is you,

902
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,220
 this is you praying this for the first time,

903
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,420
 this is your way of saying,

904
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,140
 I wanna this to build and create

905
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,460
 and have this relationship with Jesus Christ.

906
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,380
 And if you pray this prayer for the first time,

907
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,020
 I want you to either share with the person

908
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,620
 who invited you afterwards,

909
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,980
 or you can come forward and share with our team

910
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,020
 or share with somebody outside afterwards.

911
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,220
 There's lots of people here

912
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,060
 that would love to help you in this journey

913
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,620
 that you're about to step into.

914
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,940
 And so as a church community,

915
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,740
 and if this is for you for the first time,

916
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,020
 all of us are gonna pray this out loud,

917
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,580
 but this is for you too.

918
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,220
 Let's just pray this, Lord Jesus,

919
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,340
 I wanna thank you for dying for me,

920
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,660
 for going to the cross,

921
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,300
 to pay the price for my sin.

922
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,740
 I recognize that I have done some things

923
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,620
 that have hurt you,

924
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,100
 that have hurt me,

925
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,820
 that have hurt others.

926
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,220
 And I ask in this moment that you would forgive me.

927
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,740
 And I invite you to now come into my life.

928
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,300
 I invite you to forgive me.

929
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,660
 I accept your grace.

930
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,980
 And I ask that your Holy Spirit,

931
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,020
 your love and your joy and your peace

932
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,380
 would be in me now,

933
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,980
 now and forever.

934
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,020
 And I thank you for this,

935
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,740
 in Jesus' name, amen.

936
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,940
 All right, we can open our eyes.

937
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,140
 Why don't we give a round of applause for anyone here,

938
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,820
 whether online, in this room.

939
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,540
 May that prayer for the first time,

940
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,020
 we're so excited for you.

941
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,780
 Please do share with the person you came with

942
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,980
 or share with us afterwards.

943
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,620
 We'd love to help you in your walk.

944
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,140
 For the rest of us, well, for all of us,

945
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,180
 why don't we stand together?

946
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,380
 And we're going to just respond together

947
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,220
 in one more time of worship.

948
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,800
 (gentle music)
