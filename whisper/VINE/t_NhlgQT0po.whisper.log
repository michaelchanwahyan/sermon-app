[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Ben and I support the same soccer team, same football team,
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.040]   so it's good to be up there.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.720]   11 o'clock tonight, right, we'll be ready for the match.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.000]   It's so good to be back in Yuen Long
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.600]   and to have the opportunity to be part of this
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.840]   Living the Kingdom Parable Series.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.780]   A parable is, of course, an earthly story
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.760]   with a heavenly meaning.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.660]   And Pastor Tim has already graciously led us through
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.480]   the parable of the workers in the vineyard
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.640]   and the parables of the lost coin and the lost sheep.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.880]   I'm speaking today about the parable
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.200]   of the Pharisee and the tax collector.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.760]   It is taken from Luke chapter 18,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.520]   and without further ado, I'd like us to read it.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.320]   To some who were confident of their own righteousness
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.720]   and looked down on everyone else,
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.640]   Jesus told this parable.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.960]   Two men went up to the temple to pray,
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.960]   one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.600]   The Pharisee stood by himself and he prayed,
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.200]   God, I thank you that I'm not like other people,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.480]   robbers, evildoers, adulterers,
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.300]   or even like this tax collector.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.300]   I fast twice a week and I give a 10th of all I get.
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.700]   But the tax collector stood at a distance.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.720]   He would not even look up to heaven,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.940]   but he beat his breast and said,
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.480]   Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:03.040]   I tell you, it was this man rather than the other
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.440]   who went home justified before God.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.160]   For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.580]   and those who humble themselves will be exalted.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.120]   I always think it helps when we study
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.480]   a passage in scripture to see what comes before it
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.680]   and to see what comes after it.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.680]   I always say, you know, you take a text out of context
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.800]   and all that is left is a con
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.620]   and I'm not here to con you this morning.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.880]   But what I did found interesting as I prepared this week,
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.880]   I discovered that this parable is rather like a bridge
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.680]   and I've put on here, Shenzhen Bay Bridge
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.680]   just down the road.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   You see, in the previous chapter, Luke 17,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.520]   the Pharisees, the religious people were pestering Jesus
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.340]   about the kingdom he had been referring to.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.960]   The kingdom against the backdrop of the oppressive
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.560]   and heartless Roman Empire.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.320]   Jesus had said this,
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.680]   once on being asked by the Pharisees
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.160]   when the kingdom of God would come,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.720]   Jesus replied, the coming of the kingdom of God
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.680]   is not something that can be observed,
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.900]   nor will people say, here it is, there it is,
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.800]   because the kingdom of God is in your midst.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.360]   You see, the Pharisees were looking for signs
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.100]   for the coming of the kingdom.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.280]   Jesus tells them not to be looking to signs,
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.800]   but to be looking to him.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.380]   The kingdom of God had already come.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.280]   He was it and they failed to recognize him.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.420]   Jesus then turns from the Pharisees to his disciples.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.640]   Remember, he's walking towards Jerusalem
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.440]   where he's going to die on a cross.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.480]   He's gonna raise from the dead and then ascend into heaven.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.920]   It won't be long before all these sweet days
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.040]   of hanging out with Jesus, walking to Jerusalem
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.260]   are going to come to an end for the disciples.
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.880]   At the end of this discourse, he tells them two parables.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.280]   The first one is the parable of the persistent widow,
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.360]   which we will have to save for another day.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.000]   But just look how Jesus began it.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.840]   Verse one, chapter 18.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.520]   Then Jesus told his disciples a parable
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.040]   to tell them they should always pray,
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.400]   always pray and not give up.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.920]   He then uses the analogy of a persistent widow
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.000]   to illustrate the difference
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.280]   between an unjust judge and a just God.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.080]   But you might be asking yourself,
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.200]   why have I spent all this time
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.400]   describing the approach to the road
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.040]   rather than the bridge itself?
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.860]   To use my Shenzhen Bay Bridge analogy,
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.120]   am I enjoying myself in Laofu San eating the seafood
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.400]   rather than taking the Shenzhen Bridge?
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.420]   I tell you why.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.180]   Because the Pharisees may at this stage
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.860]   have put two and two together and made five.
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.140]   And they may have concluded
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.620]   that long public battling prayers
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.940]   would put them on the right road to cross the bridge.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:28.020]   Follow the rules and you'll be on the right path.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.900]   But what I wanna do now is to skip forward
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.980]   to the other side of the bridge.
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.340]   Perhaps I'm in Shekho.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.020]   The verses that follow this parable
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.060]   and see what we find there.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.340]   Let's move to verse 15.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.980]   And June has already said these words this morning.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.860]   People were also bringing babies to Jesus
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.740]   for him to place his hands on them.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.300]   When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.220]   But Jesus called the children to him and said,
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.340]   "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.900]   "for the kingdom of God belongs to such of them."
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.020]   Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.020]   the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it.
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.480]   Anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.940]   like a little child would not enter it.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.940]   Now notice, it does not say anyone who has read the Bible
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.500]   from cover to cover, anyone who prays five times a day,
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.860]   attends community group every week,
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.820]   and is faithfully tied to the church
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.540]   will enter the kingdom of God.
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:52.700]   Now you may not have heard this approach before.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   But the bridge from persistent prayer
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:07.580]   to childlikeness has apparently come through
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.660]   the parable we are studying today.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:18.780]   You see, the Pharisees could be best described
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.860]   as those who trusted in themselves
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.980]   and held others in contempt.
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.100]   That's what Jesus said.
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.460]   Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee,
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.540]   the other a tax collector.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.980]   The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed,
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.380]   "God, I thank you I'm not like other people,
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.700]   "robbers, evildoers, adulterers,
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.800]   "even like this tax collector.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.980]   "I fast twice a week and give a 10th of all I get."
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.820]   I put these verses on the screen again.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.860]   Notice how often he uses the word I.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:06.060]   "God, I thank you that I am not like other people,
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.560]   "these various people.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.560]   "I fast twice a week and I give a 10th of all I get."
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.380]   Four times in NIV, the word I.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.360]   I went to the ESV this week and it's five times.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.240]   He says, "I give a 10th of all I get."
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.860]   Now the Pharisee is saying this,
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.840]   "I am not like other men.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:41.880]   "It's all about me, me, me, not me, myself and Irene."
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:48.980]   He is so full of himself.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.440]   He is doing all the right things.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.180]   And he wants an A plus.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.000]   He wants a gold star.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.380]   He wants a badge of honor.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.080]   We see a lot of this in Hong Kong.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:09.680]   On reflection, it was fascinating
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:15.620]   that Jesus chose a tax collector
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.400]   to compare with the Pharisee.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.440]   If we look elsewhere in the Bible,
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.440]   Jesus used the commonly held opinion of tax collectors
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:31.720]   as an illustration of the final stage of church discipline.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:39.140]   When a person is excommunicated, thrown out of the church,
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.320]   Jesus said in Matthew 18, 17,
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.320]   "To treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector."
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.560]   In other words, the excommunicant
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.520]   is to be considered an outsider
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.640]   and a candidate for evangelism.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.280]   Invite them on the Alpha Course.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:08.360]   By way of background, there are a number of reasons
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.920]   for the low view of tax collectors
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.760]   in the New Testament era.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.520]   Firstly, no one likes to pay money to the government, right?
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.320]   Especially when the government is an oppressive regime
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.660]   like the Roman Empire of the first century.
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.960]   Those who collected the taxes for such a government
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.480]   bore the brunt of much public displeasure.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.640]   Secondly, the tax collectors in the Bible were Jews.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.320]   And they were Jews who were working for the hated Romans.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.800]   These individuals were seen as turncoats,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.560]   traders to their own countrymen.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.900]   Rather than fighting the Roman oppressors,
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.460]   the publicans were helping them
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.120]   and enriching themselves at the expense of their fellow Jews.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.200]   And thirdly, it was common knowledge
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.100]   that the tax collectors cheated the people
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.600]   they collected from.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.080]   By hook or by crook, they would collect more than required
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.080]   and keep the extra for themselves.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.280]   Some jacks all right.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:22.480]   Everyone just understood that was how it worked.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.000]   Remember the tax collector Zacchaeus
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.680]   in his confession to the Lord
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.180]   mentioned his past dishonesty.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:39.360]   But this is where the parable turns itself on its head.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:47.040]   Verse 13, but the tax collector stood at a distance.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.880]   He wouldn't even look up to heaven,
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:57.600]   but beat his breast, said, God,
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:04.720]   have mercy on me, a sinner.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.420]   Wow.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.240]   Wow.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.680]   Wow.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.560]   Let's pause for a moment and give Jesus the last word.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:23.060]   I tell you that this man rather than the other
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.080]   went home justified before God.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.440]   For those who exalted themselves will be humbled
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   and those who humbled themselves will be exalted.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   Let's look at what's happened here.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.280]   The guy who justified himself was humbled.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:55.280]   The guy who humbled himself was justified.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:01.000]   This my friends is the kingdom of God.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.680]   This my friends is the kingdom of God.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.040]   Now to help us further,
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.840]   let me give you a modern version of this parable.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.120]   In the modern version of this parable,
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.740]   I chose to call the Pharisee Religious Ron.
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.040]   Sorry if there's anyone here called Ron.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:36.200]   On a given Sunday, Religious Ron
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.680]   walked into the church with his head held high
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.380]   and his chest out.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:47.320]   As he walked into the sanctuary,
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.320]   Religious Ron spotted the town drug pusher,
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:15:00.760]   the town troublemaker sitting on one of the back pews.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.320]   You wish you hadn't sat on the back pew today, right?
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.040]   He had been tried, he'd been found guilty,
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.980]   he'd spent time in prison and was recently paroled.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:20.040]   Religious Ron was disgusted to see such a man in church.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:27.600]   So he told the head usher to keep a close watch on the man
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.040]   who we will call Larry Lowlife.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.480]   Larry Lowlife had finally realized he needed
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.240]   to change the road on which he'd been traveling.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:51.080]   He desperately needed God's help and he was in church.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:56.180]   At the beginning of the pastoral prayer time,
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.440]   the pastor always gives at least 30 seconds
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.320]   for the congregation to quietly pray
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.360]   before he began his prayer.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.980]   Religious Ron's silent prayer was more about
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.600]   his own goodness than about his spiritual need.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:20.240]   Heavenly Father, I thank you that I've been a deacon
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.800]   of this church for more than 20 years.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.000]   Oh, you've blessed my business so much,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.260]   I'm able to give more of the tithe to the church.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.280]   I haven't missed Sunday service for 10 years
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.660]   even when I was sick.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:40.120]   And you know that I used to sing in the choir.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:45.120]   I don't smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or cuss on Sundays.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:51.560]   I don't use or sell drugs like the drug pushing punk
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.200]   on one of our back rooms who has the audacity
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.120]   after getting out of prison to attend our church today.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:06.780]   And Lord, please help our football team.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.320]   That's soccer for US people.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.900]   Help our football team clobber the local Baptist church
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.660]   in the church football league on Tuesday night, amen.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:22.560]   Religious Ron was so full of pride,
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.580]   he could strut even when he was sitting down.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:32.440]   Meanwhile, Larry lowlife on one of the back rows
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.640]   was praying this.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:41.100]   God be merciful to me for I'm a sinner.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:47.760]   I desperately need your help to get my life turned around
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.740]   so that I can go in the right direction.
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:59.700]   Lord, please forgive me and cleanse me.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:06.600]   I open my life to you.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.180]   Let me read verse 14 again.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.960]   I tell you it was this man rather than the other
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.620]   who went home justified before God.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:23.240]   For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.340]   and those who humble themselves will be exalted.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:32.080]   Hopefully this modern parable of religious Ron
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.160]   and lowlife Larry will help us, you and me,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.200]   to enter the worship services here at the Vine
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.160]   with a desire to primarily focus on three things.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.120]   Firstly, the goodness and the greatness of God.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.120]   Secondly, to genuinely worship him
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.620]   by focusing primarily upon your spiritual needs.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:02.280]   And thirdly, to offer your life,
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.320]   to serve him in the ways that bear witness
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   of his love to others in specific ways.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.440]   In the original parable of the Pharisee
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.020]   and the tax collector, Jesus said,
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:21.120]   there are two attitudes that people
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.560]   generally display in worship.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.880]   Number one, I'm proud of my goodness.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:35.440]   Pride loves to use the personal pronouns I and me.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.320]   It seldom omits a need.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.740]   It does not focus on the needs of others.
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:50.720]   Or secondly, I desperately need God's mercy.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:55.760]   I've got a question for you.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.520]   Which of these two attitudes,
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.480]   which of these two attitudes best describes your spirit
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.740]   as you enter church on a Sunday morning?
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:10.300]   Before I finish, I wanna push this a stage further
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.140]   if you don't mind.
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.220]   I wanna get really personal.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.620]   I wanna give you a question.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:24.540]   If you were to die tonight and stand before the Holy God,
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:30.980]   on what basis would you seek entrance
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:32.820]   into heaven?
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:37.220]   Think about it, I'm gonna say it again.
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:43.620]   If you were to die tonight and stand before the Holy God,
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:51.340]   on what basis would you seek entrance into heaven?
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:58.460]   I mentioned earlier the parable of the persistent widow
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.220]   or the ungodly widow.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.940]   The parable of the persistent widow or the unjust judge
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.380]   that preceded this parable.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.980]   It ends with the question.
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.580]   However, when the Son of Man comes,
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.480]   will he find faith on the earth?
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.400]   Since now we're getting very serious,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.760]   we're talking about our eternal destinies.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.260]   I cannot think of anything more important
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.860]   for us to hear the truth of Jesus' message in this parable.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.460]   You see, if we were to go out from here today
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.420]   and ask people in Yoho Mall,
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.340]   even those who are regular church goers,
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.640]   are you sure of your eternal destiny
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.540]   that you'll go to heaven when you die?
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.700]   I guarantee that the prevalent answer would be,
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.320]   no, I'm not sure.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:55.660]   If we probe a little bit further and ask them why
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.780]   they were not sure.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.060]   We'd probably hear things like,
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.020]   I'm not sure I'm good enough.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:11.300]   Reinforcing a widely held belief that somehow,
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.420]   somehow our good deeds will be measured up
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.740]   against our bad ones on some kind of spiritual scorecard.
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.500]   Salvation by KPIs, you might say.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.980]   That we somehow need to earn our way into heaven
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.220]   by being good.
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:34.440]   Even though we know we are just not able to achieve this.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:41.780]   The ultimate difficulty that any human being
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.300]   will encounter is this.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:49.420]   How can any unjust person in the presence of a just God
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:54.940]   stand at the last judgment?
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.280]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:04.460]   The only way, the only way we can stand
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.860]   is to be justified.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.720]   To be declared just.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.160]   And when we say that justification is by faith alone,
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.260]   that is simple shorthand for justification
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.940]   by Jesus Christ alone.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.500]   Faith is the sole instrument by which we can grab hold
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.180]   of Christ and his justice is transferred to us.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:38.180]   God imputes or counts the righteousness of Jesus
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.920]   to those who put their trust in him.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.260]   But I tell you today,
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.780]   if you trust in yourself,
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:53.620]   you stand by yourself.
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.620]   The only way you will ever stand before a just
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.500]   and holy God is as one clothed in the righteousness
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.340]   of Christ.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.820]   You add nothing to it.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:13.820]   Jesus ended this little parable by saying,
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.700]   I tell you that this man, the tax collector,
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.340]   went home justified before God.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.620]   The man couldn't even look up to heaven.
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.780]   He couldn't get near to the holy of holies,
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.940]   could only beat his chest and repent in sin,
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.020]   plead for the mercy of God and throw himself
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.740]   at the mercy of the court.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:47.260]   He walked out the door and went home justified.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:55.580]   My friends, do not leave here today
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:02.580]   until you tell the Lord God almighty that you are a sinner
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:08.100]   and cannot stand apart from his mercy and grace.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:13.300]   If you throw yourself and your soul to him
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.900]   and his mercy clinging to Christ,
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.380]   you will go home justified.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.740]   Jesus said of the spiritual man, the Pharisee,
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:32.060]   the one who came so close, so close to the holy place,
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:38.420]   the tax collector went home justified rather than the other.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:45.900]   The Pharisee went home that day and he continued to tithe
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.540]   and he continued to fast.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.340]   But he remained an unjustified person.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:26:00.100]   If you were to die tonight and stand before God
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:04.980]   and God said to you, why should I let you into my heaven?
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.500]   What would you say?
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:15.260]   I hope you would say, because of Jesus.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.340]   Because he's my only hope, I put my trust in him.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.500]   Everything else is sinking sand.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.740]   Then he will look at you.
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:38.500]   He'll say, please come in.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.580]   My son is already here.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.220]   He's prepared a place for you
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.380]   that you might bask in his glory now and forevermore.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:58.540]   Let's close our eyes and ask the worship band to come back.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:09.660]   We're gonna be singing that song, Come to the Altar, again.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:14.540]   I joked about it before I preached the sermon.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.020]   I think the song had already done my sermon for me.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.020]   It's a middle song.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:23.180]   I want you to use that song
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:29.980]   to come back to the altar on your knees before Jesus
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.180]   where the place is forgiveness.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:38.700]   But I wanna give an opportunity right here and now
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:43.420]   for anyone who's here today, a friend may have brought you.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.620]   You may have been coming to church for a while,
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.820]   but you've never said,
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.060]   Jesus, I want you to be the savior of my life.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:57.300]   You come here, you love the music,
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.300]   you love the fellowship, the friendship,
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:06.180]   but you've never asked Jesus to be the savior of your life,
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:10.220]   trust in him for your salvation.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.380]   Can I tell you it's the only way?
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:19.100]   Don't go home from this sermon
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.180]   and read the Bible from cover to cover,
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.300]   pray for three hours, put on worship music all night
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.900]   to try and do things to get close to God.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.860]   None of those things are bad by the way,
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.980]   but they are if you think that's the way
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.260]   that you're gonna get right with God.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:41.460]   The only way today that you are gonna get right with God
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.500]   is to be like that tax collector.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.140]   Father, I'm a sinner.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.260]   That's not too difficult, we've all sinned.
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.620]   We are all sinners.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:59.620]   Father, I am a sinner, I am in need of your forgiveness.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.500]   And just what every eye is closed
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.300]   and please respect this for a moment.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.700]   If there is anyone here
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.180]   who wants to pray that prayer for themselves,
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.900]   who wants to pray that prayer to say,
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.900]   Jesus, I'm a sinner, I need you, come into my life.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:21.980]   I want you to do something very, very simple,
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.500]   just what every eye is closed.
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.100]   I'd love to pray for you.
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.340]   And just to know who I'm praying for, if that's you,
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.660]   I'm gonna ask you one simple thing.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:40.020]   Just to pop up your hand, raise your hands, thank you.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.740]   Raise your hand.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.340]   This is only if you wanna pray this prayer, right?
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:48.060]   I'm not asking everyone to raise their hands,
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.380]   but if that's you, you want to ask Jesus
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.100]   into your life this morning.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.780]   You want to say sorry for the things I've done wrong.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:02.660]   If you do that, you go home justified.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.500]   If you die tonight or if you die in 40 years time,
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:14.060]   God will have heard your prayer.
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.460]   So maybe as a church, we could pray this all together
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.620]   just for the people who put their hands up.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:25.500]   Church, repeat after me, Father God,
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.140]   I come before you now,
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.460]   I come before you now,
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:36.580]   I recognize that I am a sinner.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.660]   I'm in need of forgiveness.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.260]   Jesus, I believe you're the Son of God.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.260]   You died for me.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:51.140]   Jesus, forgive my sins.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.580]   Come into my life, fill me with your spirit
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.900]   and help me to live a life for you.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.700]   I pray this now in Jesus' name.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.540]   Amen.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.140]   Let's welcome those who's prayed that for the first time.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:11.780]   And church, we all have an opportunity now.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.060]   Don't be thinking now what you're gonna have for lunch,
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.180]   where are you gonna go?
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.060]   Come to the altar.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.540]   Look at these words as you sing them.
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.660]   I could have not preached this sermon
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.740]   this morning, this chorus does it all for me.
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.060]   Look at these words and my friends,
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.660]   just come to the altar and say,
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:40.660]   Lord, I need your forgiveness.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.340]   Come into my life.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.340]   Let's stand and sing.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.740]   (soft music)
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.320]   (gentle music)
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.900]   (upbeat music)
