1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 I'm so excited to be with you this morning. My name is Andrew. I'm one of the pastors here.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,760
 So if this is relatively one of your first times at the Vine, we're so glad that you're here.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:17,120
 I'm really blessed. Sandra's in the house here today. Sandra and John founded the Vine,

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,360
 led the Vine for many years. Thanks for being with us, Sandra. We love you. Justine is back.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,280
 So nice to see Justine as well. And I know that there are so many other people that are visiting

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,360
 with us. Joe, my mate from the UK, sounds so British, doesn't he? You love him. Yeah, mate.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,200
 But we know also you may be new as well. So grateful to have you with us.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,680
 We're in part two of a three-part series on justice, and in particular on God's heart for

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,840
 justice. And what we've been saying over these weeks is that what we're teaching in you last

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,760
 week, this week, next week, are foundational messages for who we are as the Vine. We feel

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,520
 here at the Vine that we've been called as a church to put justice in God's heart, to justice

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,640
 and for justice at the center of what we do as a community. And so this is your home already,

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
 or if this is going to become your home, then you're going to hear us talk a lot about the

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,440
 realities of the poor and the broken and the vulnerable in our society, in our city, in the

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,640
 situation that we're here with. And we're going to challenge one another to be the church to the city

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,840
 that is around us. Last week, as we started this series, I started by giving you a theology of

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,720
 justice. I wanted us to really understand how justice sits at the heart of the biblical

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,880
 redemptive narrative that we have in Scripture. And so we literally went from Genesis to Revelation,

19
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,920
 unpacking the idea that the gospel, and this is really important, church, that the gospel

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,680
 is not just the restoration of my relationship with God, as important as that is. That's certainly

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,920
 a central part of the gospel. What we see in Scripture, that the gospel is the restoration

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,080
 of not just a broken relationship here, but also a broken relationship here. That if the gospel

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:03,360
 truly brings shalom, then the gospel has to rectify the four broken relational contexts that we see

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,880
 happen in Genesis 1, 2, and 3. And we looked last week, didn't we, that in Genesis 1 and 2, God

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,640
 creates humanity as the pinnacle of his heart, labels humanity as the image of God, and then

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,880
 defines for humanity what is right and wrong. We said last week that God is the one that defines

27
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,240
 for us what is right and wrong. And then God creates four relational contexts by which we

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,640
 express the right and wrong of the Father. That's our relationship with God, our relationship with

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,600
 ourselves, our relationship with others, and our relationship with creation. So in Genesis 1 and 2,

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,080
 we see these beautiful relational contexts created. And at the end of Genesis 2, God stands

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,000
 back from that, and he says those words, he says, "This is shalom." This is the way things were

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,680
 meant to be. The world is now designed and is flourishing in the way in which it was created

33
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,480
 to be. And then, of course, we saw Genesis 3, the intaking of sin, Satan's tricking of humanity to

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,840
 think that they shouldn't just be image of God, but they can be gods themselves. And in taking

35
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,880
 that fruit, what we see straight away is that humanity now begins to define what is right and

36
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,720
 wrong. Where in Genesis 1 and 2, God defines what is right and wrong, in Genesis 3, humanity begins

37
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
 to take on the ability or thinks that it has the ability to define what is right and wrong. And we

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,320
 said last week that when humanity defines what is right and wrong rather than the divine,

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,480
 we will always define it in a way that benefits ourselves, like myself, not you. Like I will

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,520
 define it in a way where I will have an advantage over others and where there'll be self-preservation.

41
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,080
 So last week, we saw Adam throwing his wife immediately under the bus when God shows up.

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,040
 That brokenness of relationship begins to happen, and we begin to create right and wrong in the way

43
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,880
 that we want it for the benefit of ourselves, and injustice is born. And then we saw, of course,

44
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,440
 that God begins to restore this through the calling of a nation, Israel through Abraham.

45
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,600
 We saw that importance of justice and righteousness, the reality that those

46
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,640
 things work together within that nation, and yet also the idea of wickedness. And we said last week,

47
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,840
 didn't we, that the wickedness or the way of injustice is wicked, and the wicked in the Old

48
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,680
 Testament basically are willing to disadvantage the community for the advantage of themselves,

49
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,240
 whereas the justice and righteous are willing to disadvantage themselves for the advantage of the

50
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,800
 community. And so you get this beautiful picture in the Old Testament of what Scripture calls us to

51
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,440
 in this idea of justice, but it's just beginning to be modeled for them. And then we see the

52
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,240
 Exodus, and in the Exodus is that model that begins to happen. God takes his oppressed people

53
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,120
 in compassion. He advocates on their behalf. Then he acts to bring them out of their slavery,

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,560
 and he provides for them that great place of future flourishing in the promised land. And so we see

55
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,040
 the Exodus story as God's model. He's beginning to show his people what this justice journey

56
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,680
 can look like. But again, we saw in the Old Testament that there's this cycle of injustice,

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,400
 that even though God is beginning to model it, even though God is beginning to redefine the

58
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,080
 right and wrong for his people, the people are so steeped in sin, it so easily has entangled them

59
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,000
 that they realize by the end of the Old Testament that they can't do it. They can't fix that

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,360
 relationship with God. They can't fix the relationship with themselves. They can't fix

61
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,360
 the relationship with others, and they certainly can't fix the relationship with the broken world

62
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,320
 around us. And so there's this crying out at the end of the Old Testament, right? There's this

63
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,360
 desire for God to step in and do what only God can do, because humanity cannot do it.

64
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,640
 And then Jesus, this beautiful incarnation, fully God and fully human, the spoke that is

65
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,120
 driven in that wheel of injustice to borrow Dietrich Bonhoeffer's beautiful picture.

66
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,520
 And Jesus, because he's fully God and fully human, he is the spoke because he's fully God,

67
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,400
 but then he's able to deal with sin because he's fully human. And being those two things together,

68
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,360
 he begins to model for us a new way. Again, advocacy, again, work in action with his

69
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,440
 miracles and the way that he serves and he teaches. And then that moment on the cross,

70
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,320
 the moment on the cross where he gives his life so that we might know the fullness of life,

71
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,520
 where he pays that price for the redemption of our sin, the blood poured out, the sacrifice

72
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,600
 once and for all so that sin no longer has the final say. And then in his resurrection, the

73
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,320
 creating of a new community, the church, a community that he fills with his spirit and

74
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,400
 sends out into the world to now be his hands and feet, to disciple the nations, to bring them into

75
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,160
 a new way of thinking. And all of the New Testament centers this on this idea of the gospel,

76
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,280
 that the gospel is not just about the restoration of my relationship with God alone, as central as

77
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,880
 that is. But as that relationship is also then healed and restored, then I have a restored

78
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,640
 relationship with myself. I no longer consider myself a slave, but I am a child of God. I then

79
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,920
 have a restored relationship with those around me. I've been brought into a family together,

80
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,160
 and now there is peace amongst us as a community. And then because creation has been groaning,

81
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,160
 but now it will no longer groan because Christ on the cross has paid the price and creation itself

82
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,480
 longing for its own redemption and the gospel, if it is the gospel, if it is a gospel that brings

83
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,800
 shalom, if it's a gospel that deals with the brokenness of sin, can't just fix this. It has

84
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:23,920
 to also fix this, fix this, and fix that. That's the whole gospel. That was all last week in about

85
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,040
 five seconds for you. Okay, so if that was helpful for you, or you're like, I need to understand that

86
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,480
 a little bit more, can I invite you to go back next week, last week and have a listen to that

87
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,320
 message. But basically, that's what we taught. There's a biblical mandate for justice. It sits

88
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,520
 at the heart of the gospel. It's the restoration of all of those broken contexts. So now we stand

89
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,640
 here in week two. And here's the question we should all be asking. If that is true, how should

90
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:56,720
 we now live? Like, how do I now live in this world if that's the gospel? If we here at the Vine are

91
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,000
 going to say we're people of the gospel, if I'm saying that being a person of the gospel is to be

92
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,840
 involved somehow in the restoration of four of those relational contexts, how do I now live?

93
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,840
 Like, what should be my agenda? What should be my priorities? Like, what should I be focused on in

94
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,040
 the here and now? I'm not just waiting till I die to go to heaven. Like, I've got something to do now.

95
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,920
 God's peeled the curtain back at the end of all things in Revelation 21 and 22. And He's shown

96
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,560
 us a picture of every knee bowing, every tongue and tribe confessing. He's shown us a picture where

97
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,800
 sin is no longer present, where the leaves of the trees are for the healing, where there's that

98
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,360
 one tree of the tree of life, no more the tree of the knowledge of the new. He's peeled it back,

99
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,160
 and He's saying to us, "Live on behalf of that vision now." So if God's heart is the restoration

100
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:51,040
 of all things, the renewal of all things, if God's heart is justice, how should we now live?

101
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,800
 I want to challenge us by saying this as direct as I can. You cannot call yourself a Christian

102
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,240
 and remain distant to the injustice in society around you.

103
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,880
 You cannot call yourself a Christian if you're not on behalf of the gospel.

104
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,360
 And if the gospel is the restoration of all of those broken relational contexts,

105
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,080
 and if justice sits in the heart of that, and if that's where God is taking us at the end of all

106
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,400
 things in Revelation 21 and 22, if we're not on behalf of that now, you should stop calling

107
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:29,360
 yourself a Christian. Because being centered in Christ means that I am centered in a context by

108
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,480
 which it is painful and dying and hurting and sin is doing stuff in it. And I stand as a person with

109
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,720
 Christ in humility, knowing I'm not the answer for everything. The world is never going to be

110
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,920
 perfect until Christ comes back. We're living in this now, but not yet. But that does not mean I'm

111
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,880
 mute. It does not mean that I haven't got something to say. It doesn't mean that the

112
00:09:50,880 --> 00:10:00,320
 gospel is to wait until he returns. No, the gospel has action now. And this call upon us as a people

113
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,520
 of Christ is a wonderful thing. Paul, when he writes to the church in the New Testament, have

114
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,040
 you ever noticed this? Right at the start of the letter, he doesn't just say this as it's like a

115
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,040
 greeting thing. He says, "You are in Christ in Ephesus." Or he says, "You're in Christ in Colossae,

116
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,320
 in Christ in Philippi." It's basically Paul's way of saying, "Don't you realize that your relationship

117
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,680
 with Jesus is not just in Christ, you're in Christ in a context. You're in Christ in a city.

118
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,280
 You're in Christ around a whole bunch of people that are desperately in need of the gospel. You're

119
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,760
 in Christ in Corinth, in Christ in Philippi. And I want to say to you, if you live here in this city,

120
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,840
 you're in Christ in Hong Kong. Not just in Christ, as amazing as that is, but God has planted you here

121
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,560
 in Hong Kong. He did not do that by mistake. None of you, whether you're here for two weeks,

122
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,560
 two months, two years, two decades, are here in Hong Kong by mistake. Our city desperately needs

123
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,560
 the gospel. There are injustices at work around us. And if we're going to call ourselves a Christian,

124
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,880
 we're going to realize that our relationship with Jesus has something to say to our context.

125
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,520
 I'm in Christ in Hong Kong. That should mean something.

126
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,160
 I had the privilege a number of years ago of meeting with one of my justice heroes. His name

127
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,440
 is John Perkins. And John Perkins was a contemporary of Martin Luther King Jr. and was very involved

128
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,640
 with the civil rights movement in the 60s. And he was speaking to a small group of us pastors

129
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,920
 at this conference I was at. And he said this incredible thing. He said that the church of

130
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,920
 Jesus is always at its best when it is a community of hope wrapping its arms around a community of

131
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:50,240
 pain. And if we're in Christ in Hong Kong, and if we're the people of the gospel in this city,

132
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,440
 then we should be asking ourselves, we have the hope. And we just sung about it. The joy of the

133
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,000
 Lord is our strength. Not our great ability to sort out all the problems in the world,

134
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,600
 not our wonderful strategies. No, our strength is the joy of the gospel. The fact that we have

135
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,440
 been reconciled to God, reconciled to ourselves, reconciled to others, reconciled to creation.

136
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,320
 And we have that message for everyone. And that should motivate us. That should put something

137
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,080
 inside of us. That should ask us to go, okay, we are the community of hope. I get that piece.

138
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,760
 What's the pain? Because if we're to be a church that's wrapping its arms around the pain,

139
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,080
 we need to know what is the brokenness? What is the injustice? What is the suffering? What is the

140
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,160
 pain around us that we can wrap ourselves around? So what I want to do is just share with you

141
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,000
 just some high level ideas about that for us and for our city. And I want to do that in the

142
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,440
 framework of this idea of us and God, us and ourselves, us and others, us and creation.

143
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,640
 Let's start with us and God. This one should move your heart immediately.

144
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,240
 Latest government statistics would say 16% of our city believe Jesus, have a relationship with

145
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,440
 Jesus, or would call themselves Christian. 16%. Now, if you just look at people who regularly

146
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,480
 attend church on a Sunday, well done. Thank you. You're here. That drops to 8%.

147
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,920
 Now, this is a statistic that should really move your heart. 84% of our city do not know Jesus. 84%.

148
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,840
 The church has been in Hong Kong for over a hundred years. I mean, even longer than that.

149
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:30,240
 I mean, there's 1700 registered churches in our city right now. And 84% of the people in

150
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,360
 this city don't know Jesus. That should burn something inside of you. That should place a

151
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,040
 holy discontent inside of us. That church is not about some holy huddle coming in and experiencing

152
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,040
 what we've experienced here this morning, as great as that is. And we love gathering here.

153
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,600
 But if this is all it is, that 84% is not going to change. What we do when we gather here is we

154
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,760
 are sent ones. We come and we worship and we experience and we weep and we cry and we pray

155
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,920
 and we fill ourselves with love so that we then go and serve the context we've been placed in.

156
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,160
 That 84% should do something in our spirits. What about us and ourselves? One of the things

157
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,640
 that we've noticed recently is the mental health related issues in our city more than anything.

158
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,760
 And what you can see here is that one in six people in Hong Kong have what's called common

159
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,960
 mental health challenges. One in six adults in our city. When you break that down to just youth,

160
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:35,520
 six years old to 17, that's one in four. 60% of the global suicides in the world happen in Asia.

161
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:43,040
 Hong Kong ranks third on a list, on that list. That's a list we do not want to be ranking on.

162
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,920
 We rank third on that list, only behind South Korea number one, Japan number two.

163
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,600
 Last year or in 2023, there were a thousand and ninety two suicides in our city. That should

164
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,840
 should do something to us. On the mental health side, the WHO organization would tell you that

165
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,760
 you need about 10 psychiatrists for every 100,000 people. Hong Kong currently has 4.1 psychiatrists.

166
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,920
 I don't know what the point one is, that's weird. But anyway, 4.1 psychiatrists to every 100,000

167
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,840
 people in our city. UBS did a research report recently and they looked at the average working

168
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:27,120
 hours in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has 50 hours of average work week. The global average is 36 hours.

169
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,200
 I want to plant a church in one of the cities where 36 hours is the...come on church.

170
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,720
 We live in a city that is driving its people way, way too hard.

171
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,240
 What about us and others? This is really important that we understand the poverty context of our

172
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,920
 city. 20% of Hong Kong people live below the poverty line in this city. We always think Hong

173
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,840
 Kong is a wealthy place. That's one point, almost 1.4 million people out of 8 million live under the

174
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,960
 poverty line here in Hong Kong. When you take the poorest person in Hong Kong and the wealthiest

175
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:07,200
 person, there is an 81.9x kind of difference between the two. Now, here's the crazy thing.

176
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:15,280
 When you did that statistic in 2019, that difference was only 44%. So in the last, what,

177
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:22,480
 five years, it's gone from being a 44% difference to an 81.9% difference. In other words,

178
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,600
 Hong Kong is getting further apart between the wealthy and the poor. The Gini coefficient is

179
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,720
 a global standard to help to kind of signify the wealth-poor gap. Hong Kong's current Gini

180
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,200
 coefficient is 0.54. Zero would be perfectly equal, one being the worst. We're right in the middle,

181
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:48,400
 0.54. But hear this, that puts us in the top 10 of places in the world in terms of the gap between

182
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,360
 the poor and the wealthy. Right now, it takes 5.3 years on average for somebody to get into

183
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,240
 public housing in Hong Kong. 200,000 people in our city are living in less than 100 square foot.

184
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,600
 Now, here's the thing, special education needs. A lot of children in our city are

185
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,200
 struggling under disability or special education needs. Currently, right now,

186
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:16,000
 there are 50,000 people, children, that will require at least 12 therapy sessions a year.

187
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,360
 That's a total cost of $430 million, and most of that money is not being made available in the

188
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,400
 public sector. Now, this should shock us when we realize that Hong Kong's current financial fiscal

189
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:38,160
 reserves is $724.8 billion, which will increase to $983 million by 2028. That's the prediction.

190
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,000
 In other words, our issue is not resource, it's distribution of that resource.

191
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,720
 And what about finally, us in creation? Have a look at this. Hong Kong currently produces around

192
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,720
 about 4 million tons of what's called metropolis, it's kind of like metropolis social waste or

193
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,200
 something like that. But it's basically the waste that we create, 4 million tons of it,

194
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,960
 of which on average is 1.44 kg per person per day. I'm glad to report that Singapore is higher at 1.88

195
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:18,400
 kg per person per day. But the joke hides the reality that we're still one of the highest,

196
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,080
 that places us within the top 20 cities in the world. Now, here's the thing that should

197
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,160
 really wake us as a church, as a community. 1.3 million tons of that is food waste alone.

198
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,920
 A third of our waste is food waste. What that means is that we love to eat,

199
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,520
 we love to order everything on the menu, and we do not eat it all.

200
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,160
 I'm going to say that one more time because some of us, myself, needed to hear this. We love to eat,

201
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,000
 we order everything on the menu, but we do not eat it all. And when we're giving a third of our

202
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,560
 waste is food, that needs something for us to be really thinking about. On the positive side,

203
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,720
 I want to say this. The government has done some great work in the area of recycling and

204
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,600
 are continuing to do a good work in the area of recycling. Right now, about 32% of our created

205
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,480
 waste a year is recycled here in Hong Kong. That's not where we want it to be overall,

206
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:21,280
 but that is much better than the less than 12% some five years ago. So Hong Kong has done a

207
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,160
 good job and the government has policies in place to try to change the recycling dynamics of our

208
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,120
 city. In terms of pollution, 20 days last year were dedicated as like dangerous levels of pollution.

209
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,440
 We're currently ranked about 63rd, I think it is, out of a global index of 138 countries when it

210
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,440
 comes to pollution. So pollution continues to be a challenge in our city. Now, the reason why I want

211
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
 to show you some of those things is because it's really important that we understand what is the

212
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,440
 pain that we need to be wrapping our arms of hope around. But when we see statistics like that,

213
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,480
 it would be easy for us to feel a bit despondent. It'd be easy for us to feel like, "Whoa, that's

214
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,320
 like a lot of bad stuff. I don't know how to respond to those statistics, Andrew. I don't

215
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,640
 know what to do. I'm feeling pretty weighed down by it." And oftentimes what happens for us when

216
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,360
 we hear stuff like this is that we retreat further rather than press in. And I want to say that, yes,

217
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,760
 the statistics are quite strong, but we have to hear this. We are the community of hope. Like,

218
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,360
 if anybody has the answer to this, then surely it's the local church and its partnership with

219
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,400
 the many NGOs that do great work in our city. That should be the starting point for our thinking. Yes,

220
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,840
 these statistics are shocking and they should shake something within us, but not shake us to

221
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,720
 despondency, shake us to action. They should make us want to stand up more, want us to be more

222
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,440
 Christian in our city, want us to live the hope of the gospel more. Now, you have to understand

223
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,080
 that for justice to happen in areas of injustice in society, basically sociologists will tell you

224
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:04,160
 that four things need to happen. Education, connectedness, adaptability, and resource.

225
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,560
 These four things are central to any transformation of any brokenness in society. Education,

226
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,320
 connectedness, adaptability, and resource. What we have to understand is that we're living in a time

227
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,560
 where all four of those things are the best that they've ever been. So if these are the four things

228
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,760
 that are helpful for us when it thinks about changing society and doing something right within

229
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,160
 the society around us, we've got to realize that those four things, I mean, we've never been more

230
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:38,160
 educated as a generation than right now. Our access to education and to information has never been

231
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,160
 higher. In fact, all the statistics I just showed you on the screen, I got from AI.

232
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:50,640
 Now, I want you, I checked the sources, okay, so it wasn't just like hallucinating AI, okay.

233
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,760
 These are good statistics from AI, but I went to AI. I mean, we're the most educated generation

234
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,280
 there has ever been. We have access to information like never before. What about when it comes to

235
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,200
 this idea of our connectedness? We're more connected than we have ever been before. Now,

236
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,040
 yes, there's a whole thing around being more connected, but never feeling more alone. That's

237
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,600
 a whole nother sermon we'll come to at some point. But the reality is we're more connected amongst

238
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,560
 each other. We have the ability to connect like never before. Adaptability, because we have this

239
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,040
 education and connectedness, we are people of the world more than we've ever been in terms of global

240
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:31,520
 citizenships. We understand culture and background and people better than ever before. We understand

241
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,160
 the ways in which different nations operate better than ever before. So we are more adaptable

242
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,480
 to the realities of our world than we've ever been. And finally, resource. I mean, you just saw

243
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,120
 in even the statistics for Hong Kong, our issue is not resources. There's incredible amounts of

244
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,840
 resources. There's more resource generated in the world than in any other time in history right now.

245
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,240
 But that resource is not going to the places where it necessarily needs to go. So here's the thing.

246
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,040
 While we might want to be despondent, we are actually better equipped now to rise up and do

247
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,960
 the things that we can do to begin to shape the world to the gospel like never before. The question

248
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:15,200
 then is how. How do we do it? We know we've got a theological mandate to do it.

249
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:22,720
 The gospel tells us we should be doing it. We know that we are in Christ in context and we've

250
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,840
 been planted here in Hong Kong. We've seen that there is pain and we are called to be a community

251
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,200
 of hope. How do we do it? Like how do we do it? Not just on a corporate level, like an institutional

252
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,320
 level, like a church level. How do you do it? Because every single one of us in this room,

253
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,800
 we have a spirit of influence where there is some injustice currently at work. For some of you,

254
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,120
 it might be your family. Maybe there's a breakdown in a relationship in your family right now and

255
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,760
 it's causing a lot of suffering and pain within the broader family dynamic. Maybe for some of you,

256
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,600
 it's a school that you attend or a university you're a part of and you see some things happening

257
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,080
 there that break your heart. Maybe you're working for an organization or a corporate and you know

258
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,000
 that there are practices happening within your business that you know is creating a bigger gap

259
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,680
 between the wealthy and the poor. Or whatever it might be. For all of us, it will look different,

260
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,440
 but every single one of us, we are in Christ in that company, in Christ in that family,

261
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,240
 in Christ in that context and we have to do something. What is it that we do? Okay,

262
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,080
 so to help you, I want to just, in the time I've got left, just show you a really short quick model

263
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,560
 of how we can actually live more justly based on what we've been talking about. I want to do it,

264
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,680
 of course, by looking at Jesus and this moment in Jesus's life. I think in this moment in Jesus's

265
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,520
 life, Jesus models for us how we can approach our context, our spirit movements, whatever

266
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,560
 justice issue might be there for us. In this beautiful moment of Jesus's life, he shows us

267
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,880
 four things that he does and I'm just going to break these down real fast. This is out of,

268
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,800
 I'm going to turn back to it, it's out of Luke chapter 19. This is his triumphal entry as he

269
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:05,840
 enters into Jerusalem. Notice what it says here. This is Luke 19, starting in verse 41 to verse 44.

270
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,480
 As Jesus approached Jerusalem, he saw the city and he wept over it and he said this,

271
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,480
 "If you, even you, had known on this day what would bring you peace,

272
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,960
 but now it is hidden from your eyes. For the days will come upon you when your enemies will

273
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,320
 build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. They will dash you

274
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,120
 to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another,

275
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,480
 because you did not recognize the time of God's coming for you." This is a significant moment in

276
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,760
 Jesus's ministry. We know from the scriptures that Jesus had a long relationship with Jerusalem. In

277
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,840
 fact, he was there at eight days old, meeting there, and Simeon and Anna prayed over him,

278
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,080
 prophesied over him. We know that he was back there for his bar mitzvah when he was about 13,

279
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,520
 where he stayed behind at the temple and his parents lost him, a nightmare for them,

280
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,040
 and he had to be in his father's house, that whole thing. But we also know that from the beginning of

281
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:09,920
 his actual ministry, Jesus has specifically stayed away from Jerusalem. He's been ministering in

282
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,000
 Galilee and Samaria and the surrounding areas, but he's been staying away from Jerusalem. He's

283
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,280
 been staying away from Jerusalem because he understands that when he gets to Jerusalem,

284
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,320
 things will begin, things will precipitate towards the cross. He knows because of that,

285
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,320
 he needs to make sure that he does the work that he's been called to do before he gets there.

286
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,800
 The turning point in the gospel of Luke is when Jesus says to the disciples, "Who do people say I

287
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,520
 am?" The disciples respond, they say, "Well, Peter responds. He says, 'You're the Christ. You're the

288
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,440
 Messiah.'" And then Luke records for us that it was from that moment that Jesus sets his face towards

289
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:48,800
 Jerusalem, walking, wanting to now be and reconnect with his city. And here Luke describes the moment

290
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:55,520
 where Jesus crests up the hill of Mount Olives and looks upon his city for the first time in what was

291
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,640
 probably a number of years. And it says here he does four things. I want to show you what these

292
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,320
 four things are because these become the kind of nucleus of a model for justice for each one of us.

293
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:14,160
 The first thing Luke says is that he approaches. Now that might sound like not a big deal on itself,

294
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,360
 but I want you to think about this. Jesus, again, he understood that when he gets to Jerusalem,

295
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,880
 things are going to kind of happen that will lead him to his death. He understands that when he gets

296
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,000
 there, the people in the triumphal entry who were shouting, "Hosanna, Hosanna," would later be the

297
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,160
 ones that would be shouting, "Crucify him." He knew that what he was about to say and do around the

298
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,000
 temple was going to basically give people the excuse that they needed to try to get him hung

299
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,320
 on a Roman cross. But Jesus still approaches. And this is really important because Jesus understands

300
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,320
 the pain that is about to come, but he doesn't stay away. In other words, Jesus makes a priority

301
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,960
 of proximity. He says, "I'm going to come to this city now at the right time in the right way,

302
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,560
 but I'm going to approach it even though I know it's going to be painful, even though I know it's

303
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,760
 going to be hard, even though I know I'm going to get rejected, even though ultimately it's going

304
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,280
 to lead me to my death, and everything inside of me would want me to stay away and just judge

305
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:23,360
 Jerusalem from Galilee. I'm not going to do that." And he puts himself in a place of proximity with

306
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,520
 his city. For some of you, there's a justice issue, an injustice in your family, an injustice in your

307
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,200
 workplace, and it scares you to think that you might need to be involved in it. And that's

308
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,320
 understandable because these things can be tough and scary. But what Jesus models for us immediately

309
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:48,320
 is proximity. The whole gospel is a relationship gospel. And one thing that Christians are really

310
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:55,520
 bad at is talking on behalf of the poor without knowing any of the poor. Talking on behalf of

311
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,960
 the vulnerable, the trafficked, the marginalized, without even knowing any of them, having never

312
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,120
 met them, having never seen them, having never put themselves in a place of understanding their

313
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,280
 suffering and their pain, but just standing back and saying, "Well, I guess I should speak for them."

314
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:16,320
 But then we speak for them in dangerous ways. Jesus draws near. Some of you, it's going to be

315
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:24,320
 painful to draw near, but we have to always put proximity over productivity. Productivity without

316
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:33,040
 proximity leads to pain. But when we are close, when we approach, we find ourselves in a place

317
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:39,120
 where we can begin to do something. What does Jesus do? Well, the next thing it says is that he sees

318
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,400
 Jerusalem. I love this because at first, this is physical. He's just come up and he's crested

319
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,240
 the Mount Olives and he looks upon his city. Now, what he would have seen, I've actually done,

320
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,520
 you can go to Jerusalem and actually do the walk that Jesus did. And you go up there and you see

321
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,440
 the olive trees that are still there around the area of Mount Olives. They're still there to this

322
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,320
 day. And then you can look on the view that Jesus had. And it's relatively similar. There's still

323
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,600
 the walls of the old city there. There's the old city on Mount Zion. Now it's a mosque, of course,

324
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,000
 but in Jesus's day, there was the temple right there. So you can kind of get a sense of what

325
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,720
 Jesus was seeing. And he crests and he physically sees what's before him. Now, what I've done for

326
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,360
 you here in this message is I've enabled you to crest a hill and physically see some things that

327
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,160
 are happening in Hong Kong. Statistics, stuff that's important for us to be aware of, stuff

328
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,600
 happening in mental health in our city, stuff happening in the pollution index and all that

329
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,160
 stuff. So all that stuff we went through, that was us physically seeing what's happening in our

330
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:46,480
 city. Does that make sense? Now, here's the thing, though. If that's all we do, just physically see

331
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,360
 the stuff that's happening in our city, educate ourselves and get good statistics, that's all

332
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:59,280
 helpful. But if that's all we ever do, we're no better than a secular NGO. The thing that makes

333
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,920
 us Christians is we do what then Jesus does, which he doesn't just see physically, but he sees

334
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,920
 spiritually. Because he looks over his city physically, but then he sees prophetically

335
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:17,360
 what's going to happen to that city in 70 AD. He sees Emperor Nero coming in and destroying many

336
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,760
 of the Christians, killing many of the people. And he says, if only you knew the peace that comes

337
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,800
 before you now, but it's hidden from you. So he doesn't just see the physical realities. He sees

338
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,440
 the spiritual stuff and not just the spiritual bad stuff, but also the spiritual good stuff.

339
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,840
 The hope that is there. And what we're modeled here by Jesus is that we're called to approach,

340
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,440
 be proximate, be in relationship. But we're also called to see physically, educate yourself,

341
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,800
 learn about the issue, know the statistics, but then pray and say, Lord, what breaks your heart?

342
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,400
 Because I see that there are 60% of the global suicides in Asia. And I see that Hong Kong is

343
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,880
 third on that list. And that does something to me. But Lord, I come to you because I want to see this

344
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,560
 issue from your eyes. Now, I want to get a burden in my heart for what breaks your heart. We sang it

345
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:11,360
 earlier, didn't we? Give me a heart that is after your heart. That's the seeing spiritually,

346
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,640
 not just physically. Otherwise, we're no better than a secular NGO.

347
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,000
 And we're the church that has the hope of the world and the gospel of life.

348
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,080
 Then Jesus does this next thing. Luke describes him as weeping. He weeps.

349
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,160
 Now, the Greek word that Luke uses is kaleo. It literally means loud wailing or

350
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,440
 or big sobbing. Like, in other words, Jesus is not crest that hill and look at Jerusalem and go.

351
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:48,640
 He crest that hill and remember, he's surrounded by people and he starts wailing. And I can imagine

352
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,680
 him shaking his fist and he's crying. Maybe he falls to his knees. We don't know exactly what

353
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,040
 happened, but there's a kaleo taking place in this man. He's not just wiping away a couple of tears.

354
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:07,280
 He is publicly travailing for his people. He's feeling something inside of him for their pain,

355
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,240
 their suffering, their struggles. A man who's about to experience the greatest pain of all.

356
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:21,360
 He's first kind of on his knees on behalf of people that are suffering. This is the idea of empathy.

357
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,000
 I want you to see this because this is really important. When we approach and we see,

358
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,360
 and if we stop at see what we've experienced is sympathy. Oh, OK. Yeah. Andrew showed some

359
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,080
 statistics today about suicides in Hong Kong, man. Yeah, that. Yeah, I'm kind of bummed about that.

360
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,320
 You know, like, like, that's not great. Yeah, man. You know, I'm glad I know that now.

361
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,600
 But that's just sympathy. Jesus moves from sympathy to a place of empathy.

362
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,080
 Empathy is like, I want to feel what those parents have felt when their child has killed themselves.

363
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,520
 I want to feel what what the what those that are trafficked into our city are feeling in terms of

364
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,320
 what's going on in their life. I want I want to have some. And look, you cannot have empathy unless

365
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,600
 you approach. Are you following this? You can't have this unless you've done a bit of this.

366
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,680
 You've got to understand the issue, but then you've got to make sure that you feel it. This

367
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,800
 is where prayer also becomes very important. We weep. Now, that doesn't mean some of us will

368
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,840
 actually literally weep, but we can weep in our spirit as a holy discontent inside of me.

369
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,320
 That this world is not as Christ would want it to be, that there is not the shalom that Jesus died

370
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,360
 on the cross for. And that moves me. That does something to me. And I cry out in that place of

371
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:38,720
 pain to the one that can only fix it. So this weeping of Jesus was central.

372
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:47,520
 To this work of justice that he was about to do, but notice he then speaks.

373
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,800
 Now, this is really great because eventually Jesus, then after weeping, after approaching

374
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,040
 and being proximate, seeing physically and spiritually and empathizing, he then moves

375
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,840
 into what I would say is compassion. See, empathy without action is just empathy.

376
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,520
 Empathy with action is compassion. It's like we've, we've taken this place of empathy and

377
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,840
 we've begun to actually do something, work, something, say something, be something, act in

378
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,600
 a certain way, suddenly have different consuming habits, suddenly recycle more at home, whatever

379
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,520
 it might be. It might be a small thing or a big thing, but we've begun to, Hey, I've approached

380
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,080
 this issue. I've seen it physically and spiritually. I felt something for it. There's something in my

381
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,800
 spirit that's not right about it. I brought it to Jesus. I'm praying, but I'm also now going to

382
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,720
 speak, act, do something that aligns myself to being a person of the gospel. One that restores

383
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,760
 all of those break on relational context. That's what I want to do. So Jesus provides for us,

384
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,360
 I think simply and beautifully this model that we can all apply into our lives, whether it's a big

385
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,040
 issue or a small issue, something in our family, something in our workplace. The first thing we

386
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,840
 should do is I want to approach, but here's the problem. A lot of Christians make the mistake we

387
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,600
 make. We approach and we jump straight to speak. Oh, we love to do this as Christians.

388
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,880
 Like we like to show up somewhere and approach something and just tell everybody what we think

389
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,080
 about it. I tell you what, there is a lot of damage that has been done over church history

390
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:23,600
 by Christians that have approached really important issues and just begun to speak and have

391
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,040
 bypassed what Jesus models for us. Jesus didn't just approach his city and begin to declare

392
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,280
 something over them, even though he had every right to do so. Jesus shows us something. Now,

393
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,760
 here's the next thing though. A lot of Christians might approach and then educate themselves about

394
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,640
 the issue and then they jump straight to speaking. That's even worse because this one is ignorance

395
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,280
 and there's some damage that can be done through ignorance, but I tell you what, this is judgment

396
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,640
 and a lot of damage is done through the church through judgment because it's like I've approached,

397
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,040
 I've learned, I've seen there's a physical, there's a spiritual and now let me tell you

398
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,520
 what God thinks about your sin. Let me tell you what God thinks about your brokenness

399
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:14,560
 and we become a church that wags its finger. Jesus doesn't show up to his city and he's got

400
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,520
 some pretty strong things to say to them. He's about to go to the temple and like whip people

401
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,960
 around, okay? Like this is not safe, cuddly Jesus time. He's got some strong stuff to say,

402
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,040
 but I want you to see something. He does not approach, see, and then jump straight to speak.

403
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:34,800
 Jesus weeps. He feels something. He allows to put himself in the pain of the people that he sees

404
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,040
 spiritually. He feels that emotion inside of him so that he knows, man, this is what the pain is

405
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,560
 like. This is what the brokenness is like, man. I'm not going to stand from a distance and judge

406
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,600
 with a finger. I'm on my knees because I feel it with them. I feel the longing inside of them for

407
00:37:53,600 --> 00:38:01,200
 their freedom. Lord, would you bring them free? But notice also, Jesus doesn't just stop at the

408
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,680
 weeping. I think we do this as a church as well. Oh, we come in on a Sunday, Lord, save our city,

409
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:15,440
 and then we never share the gospel with anyone. See, the problem is we can get paralysis by

410
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:22,240
 analysis. Are you with me? And we can get paralysis by being over-emotional. Jesus goes

411
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,720
 all the way through that, and then he speaks. He allows the thing to impact and affect him,

412
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,160
 and then he stands up and he says, "Oh, Jerusalem, that only you knew."

413
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,240
 And then he begins to act in ways throughout the whole week that would reinforce the gospel

414
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,120
 that he's bringing the hope of the world, and then he goes to the cross, and then he rises,

415
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,440
 and he changes everything. My friends, whether you have a problem in your family,

416
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,480
 whether you see an injustice at work, whether there's something in those statistics where

417
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,440
 you're like, "I want to learn more about that," can I say that this applies to it all?

418
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:06,560
 Don't be distant. Educate yourself, but don't forget to pray. Feel what it is that's going

419
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,320
 on for the people of our city. Learn from their perspective. Hear their voices. Understand their

420
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:21,200
 pain, and then by the guidance of the Holy Spirit, do what he calls you to do. Approach, see, weep,

421
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,640
 speak. When we do that, we begin to show the world the whole gospel. Amen? Amen.

422
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,680
 All right. Can I invite you to stand? I want to pray for us here this morning.

423
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,200
 I wonder whether you just quieten your heart, open your hands,

424
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:48,560
 just allow the Holy Spirit just to speak to you. Lord, I want to pray that you would show each

425
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,960
 person here just one thing in their sphere of influence. Maybe some of you in this room,

426
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,840
 you know what it is immediately, where there's an injustice around you that you know the Holy

427
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:06,640
 Spirit might be wanting to use you in. But perhaps for many of us, we're not aware immediately. Just

428
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:15,520
 take a moment. Come, Holy Spirit, come. Father, I pray that you would speak. I pray that you would

429
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:26,480
 show. Lord, I thank you that every single person here, they're not perfect. They're not going to

430
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,240
 have all the answers. Oh, they're going to make mistakes along the way. I've made plenty.

431
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:37,760
 But Lord, I pray that they would approach, see, weep, and speak with courage and boldness

432
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,240
 as your Spirit leads them. Lord, I pray that this would change those statistics that we looked at

433
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:51,280
 today. Lord, we're not satisfied with just 16% of our city knowing you. Lord, would you bring revival

434
00:40:51,280 --> 00:41:00,240
 in Hong Kong? Lord, we're not satisfied with the mental health issue. We had a viral pandemic. We

435
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:07,680
 have a mental health pandemic now. Lord, would you do help us to be people who weep with our

436
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,640
 brothers and sisters that are struggling in this time? We thank you for work like Oasis and other

437
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,560
 things that the Vine does to help in that space. But Lord, would you give us a fresh voice?

438
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,240
 Father, I want to pray particularly for the weeping for people in this room.

439
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,600
 Not a weeping that leads to sorrow, that leads to retreat,

440
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,640
 but a weeping that is a godly sorrow that catalyzes into action.

441
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:40,160
 And Father, as we find that within us by your Spirit, not made by our own strength,

442
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,120
 Father, we thank you that empathy moves to compassion.

443
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:52,560
 And we thank you that in whatever area that you might be leading us into, we can play a part

444
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,200
 for the whole gospel in our city. Lord, I pray that this would be a fire lit for the Vine

445
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:07,040
 in the season that we're in. May it be for your glory and your glory alone. And everyone here says
