1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
 Man, my name's Andrew.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,960
 I'm one of the pastors here, and we are so grateful that you are here, whether you're

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,080
 in the room, whether you're online with us right now, whether you're in the overflow

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,640
 just outside or anywhere else in the building right now listening to this.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,400
 We're so glad that you are a part of this, that you are here with us.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,340
 I cannot be more excited about the journey that is ahead of us as we start the second

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,240
 half of our Exodus series here today.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,960
 And I honestly believe, and I'm not just saying this, but if this is your home church, if

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,280
 this is where you fellowship, if this is the place where you're connected in community

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,080
 and you come here, I believe that the next 14 weeks of your life will truly be transformative

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,940
 to you.

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,640
 Because we're not here to play church, amen?

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,840
 Let me try that again one more time.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,800
 We're not here to play church, amen?

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,400
 We're here to open our hearts and our lives to the transformative work of God's power.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,920
 And you know, I said the very first words that I said at the beginning of our Exodus

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,440
 series back in the middle of April are no more important than right now as we start

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,000
 the second half today.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,800
 And the words are this, that there is nothing more powerful than truly being set free.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:17,320
 Nothing more powerful for you, for your family, for your marriage, for your work, for your

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,800
 sphere of influence than you truly being set free.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,680
 Set free from the things that hold you bound to the patterns of this world.

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,240
 Set free from the things that hold you enslaved to addictions and brokenness and hurt.

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,960
 Set free from the things that the enemy has done, is trying to do, and will do in your

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,960
 life.

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,080
 Set free to live the kind of life that Christ has always created you to be.

27
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,640
 Over the next 14 weeks, we are unpacking what I believe is the most central spiritual journey

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,200
 that there is in our scriptures.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,760
 It's the journey of Israel going from their slavery in Egypt to their freedom in the desert,

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,000
 receiving the formation of their national identity in the desert and wilderness.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,480
 And then some 40 years later, walking with their freedom into the promised land, into

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,200
 all the things that God has for them.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,600
 In the next 14 weeks, we're journeying with Israel through all of this.

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,200
 But the next 14 weeks is not about Israel.

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,560
 It's about you.

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,880
 It's honestly about you.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,960
 It's about your journey.

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,360
 The book of Exodus is merely a backdrop to the journey that God actually has on his heart

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,080
 for you.

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,760
 And that journey, as we've been talking about in this series, has five movements to it.

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,160
 I talked about this in the first half of the series.

42
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,280
 Slavery, promise, liberation, identity, home.

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,520
 And those five things are the ways that there are five kind of movements in the book of

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,160
 Exodus in those five things.

45
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,680
 And what we're starting today and over the next 14 weeks is the final three of those.

46
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,800
 Liberation, identity, and home.

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,200
 And incorporated within the liberation, identity, and home, which is basically chapter 7 of

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,920
 Exodus onwards, what's capsulated in there are some of the deepest spiritual truths that

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,240
 there are for not only you getting freedom, but you being able to stay in your freedom.

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,520
 Paul would write many years later, "You are free.

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
 Now be free."

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,080
 In other words, we have a tendency as humans to receive freedom, but then fall back into

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,360
 our old habits.

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,840
 You're going to see over the next 14 weeks that this was Israel's issue.

55
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,580
 That they received freedom, and yet it was so hard for them to get Egypt out of themselves.

56
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,560
 And then they would fall back into patterns of old thinking and patterns of ways.

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,520
 But in the next 14 weeks, we're going to see some things that I believe will set you.

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,960
 If you hear them, if you apply them, if you think about them, pray about them, receive

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,920
 them, they're going to set you on a path not just to be free, but to truly be free.

60
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,520
 Are you with me, church?

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,000
 The word Exodus itself, as I said right at the start of this series, means a departure.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,960
 And one of the questions I asked right at the beginning of the series I wanted to ask

63
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,160
 you again as we start the second half of the series today, and that is, what is it that

64
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,740
 you need to depart from?

65
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,480
 What is it that is in your heart that you're wanting to depart from?

66
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,160
 And our departure point, the slavery that we have that we want to leave and move away

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,080
 from will be different for every single one of us here.

68
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,680
 Some of us it might be an addiction, an addictive behavior to something.

69
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,560
 Some of us it might be some emotional, unhealthy emotional attachment to things.

70
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,240
 Some of us it might be mistakes that we've made in our businesses and in our marketplace

71
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,000
 work and that we've never really been able to forgive ourselves for.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,080
 For some it might be abusive relationships, whether in the past or currently, that you're

73
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,280
 struggling to be free from.

74
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,160
 From some it's hurt.

75
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,480
 It's hurt that has been spoken to you, done to you, whatever that might have been that

76
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,720
 you've carried around for you for years and you've not been able to shake the reality

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
 of that hurt.

78
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,520
 It'll be different for every single one of us.

79
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,320
 But if you're anything like me, there is a point of departure for you.

80
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,040
 There is something where you're saying, "I want to be free from this thing.

81
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,600
 I don't want this thing to hold around my heart, hold around my life anymore.

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,520
 I don't want this thing to be the thing that's going to direct my future.

83
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,640
 I want to be liberated into the identity that Christ has me in the home that he's called

84
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
 me to.

85
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,960
 And as I move in the trajectory of the Spirit of God, I want to feel that liberation so

86
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,840
 that I can not just be free, but so that I can be an instrument of liberation for others."

87
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,200
 And if this is your home church, then honestly the next 14 weeks, I believe, will be life

88
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,640
 transformative for you.

89
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
 I believe the whole…

90
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
 I can't express…

91
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,000
 It's so hard to express this in a way that really is my heart.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,200
 As your pastor here, my heart is that you would be free.

93
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,120
 My heart is so much that you would take a hold of everything we're going to be doing

94
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,720
 over these weeks with all the different speakers and all the different ways, with the devotional

95
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,800
 book that we're giving you, all the resources we're providing for you, so that you would

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,600
 taste and know that the Lord is good.

97
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,880
 Amen?

98
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,600
 That's Exodus.

99
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
 That's what Exodus is all about.

100
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,400
 It's not a story about a nation in the past that we can learn some historically nice things.

101
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,240
 Exodus is a pattern of renewal and revival for today.

102
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
 And God is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

103
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,920
 And what we see Him do for the Israelites, He is still doing for His people today, and

104
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,080
 He's going to do for you.

105
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,360
 So where are we?

106
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,440
 Where are we in the story?

107
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,560
 Where are we in the Exodus today as we step into the second half of what's ahead?

108
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,280
 Well, to help with that, let me give you a little bit of a recap of the journey that

109
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,040
 we've been on so far and all the things that we kind of sense that God has been teaching

110
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,040
 and informing us about in the first half of the series.

111
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,080
 We started back in mid-April in chapter one, and in chapter one, we're introduced to a

112
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,420
 couple of realities.

113
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:55,620
 There is this Egyptian authority structure around a person called Pharaoh.

114
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,440
 And Pharaoh has seen that this immigration group, this group of immigrants that have

115
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,020
 come into his nation over the last hundred years or so, have now grown to such a large

116
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,280
 size that he's afraid for his power.

117
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,960
 In fact, we're introduced to the reality of the feeling of inadequacy and the feeling

118
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,360
 of kind of like, you know, sort of insecurity.

119
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,120
 Because Pharaoh is totally insecure, even though he's the most powerful figure in the

120
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,120
 world at that point with an empire that's stretched larger than any other empire in

121
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
 that moment.

122
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,680
 He sees this immigrant group, and he's frozen in fear.

123
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
 The insecurities wreck him.

124
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,320
 And what we saw in week one is that insecurity is always the primary brokenness that drives

125
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,960
 the oppression of others.

126
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,580
 Any oppression that you'll ever find in your life, anything that you ever find weighted

127
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,040
 down on, or any enslavery that ever comes to you, comes from this root of somebody's

128
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,400
 insecurity.

129
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,500
 Somebody who felt threatened, somebody who felt jealous, somebody who felt like they

130
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,360
 needed to do something to someone else to make those persons smaller so that they could

131
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
 be bigger.

132
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,880
 Insecurity is the primary brokenness that drives the oppressions of others.

133
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,280
 But what we saw in week one was this incredible thing.

134
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,120
 Two brave Hebrew women who were midwives, who had been ordered by Pharaoh to kill all

135
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,400
 of the male Hebrew boys, refused to do it, drew a line in the sand, and said, "The only

136
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,880
 authority that we're going to stand under is the authority of God."

137
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:29,240
 And in the bravery of putting their own lives on the line, they start the Exodus journey.

138
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,320
 We see in the beginning of chapter two, two other women who come along.

139
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,680
 First we see Moses' mother, who now that the decree has gone beyond just killing the

140
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,960
 baby boys, it's now taking young Hebrew boys and drowning them in the river of the Nile.

141
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:50,480
 And so she takes her child, Moses, and places him in a basket, refusing to allow him to

142
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,960
 be drowned, and sets him off down the Nile River, letting him go in trust of God, knowing

143
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,040
 that if I place him in this ark, just like how Noah had placed the animals in the ark

144
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,960
 and let this go, God will do something amazing.

145
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,320
 And so God then takes another brave woman, Pharaoh's daughter.

146
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,880
 And Pharaoh's daughter sees this Hebrew baby in the basket in the Nile, and she knows that

147
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,960
 she should turn the basket upside down and drown the child, but instead she stands against

148
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,720
 the decree of her father, takes this child, and brings this child into her household in

149
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,080
 order to be raised as a prince of Egypt himself.

150
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,080
 And we learn in the second week something quite profound.

151
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:38,280
 Stories of redemption and freedom so often occur in the very same places where the worst

152
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,480
 acts of oppression have occurred.

153
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,440
 And Moses grows up in Pharaoh's household, conflicted.

154
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,240
 Oh man, he is so conflicted in his identity, because he knows that his skin and his blood

155
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,040
 is Hebrew, but his clothes and his household and his culture is Egyptian.

156
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,660
 And he's being raised, potentially, to take over the leadership of Egypt by Pharaoh himself.

157
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,400
 So he's being raised within a Pharaoh culture, knowing that he's wearing Hebrew skin.

158
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,880
 And this conflict of identity is a difficult thing for Moses.

159
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,200
 He doesn't know, am I an oppressor or am I one of the oppressed?

160
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,200
 And he's caught in the middle of that tension.

161
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,140
 And one day he sees an Egyptian beating up one of his fellow Hebrews, and he's so incensed

162
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,840
 in anger that he murders that Egyptian, and in doing that realizes he's crossed the line.

163
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,480
 And he needs to flee from Egypt, flee from all the identity and all the things he knew,

164
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
 and he has to run away.

165
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,320
 And we learned that week something very important, that the starting point of all of our Exodus

166
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,080
 is when we realize that we're all carrying broken identities around with us that cover

167
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,440
 up the real person that we truly are.

168
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,920
 And part of our freedom in Exodus is to deal with some of those broken identities, to enable

169
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,240
 them to shift and to change in our lives.

170
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,120
 And we see the end of chapter 2 how God begins to do that.

171
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,240
 God shows up for the first time in the story, and he presents himself and he says, "Here's

172
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
 what I've seen.

173
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,480
 I've seen the slavery and the misery of my people, and my heart is turned towards them."

174
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,560
 And he says, "I am in my compassion coming down to help them."

175
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,360
 And we learned something really important that week, that it's compassion, not judgment,

176
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,920
 that is the fuel for Exodus.

177
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,560
 And judgment is a reality in the process of Exodus, and we're going to see that actually

178
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
 today.

179
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,960
 But compassion is the fuel for Exodus.

180
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
 Compassion is the starting point.

181
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,840
 God didn't show up and go, "I'm going to judge."

182
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,000
 He shows up and says, "My heart is broken."

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,120
 So in order to respond to that, he then calls Moses.

184
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,200
 In the middle of the desert, burning bush.

185
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,280
 And Moses draws over in chapter 3 towards this burning bush, and he recognizes that

186
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,520
 there's something behind the bush.

187
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,360
 And God speaks and says, "Remove your sandals, for the ground that you're standing on is

188
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
 holy ground."

189
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,720
 And what God is doing is saying, "I've moved in compassion."

190
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,200
 But the first point is to meet with Moses intimately on that broken level that he's

191
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,160
 in, and invite him to take his sandals off so the nakedness of his foot would touch the

192
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,140
 Spirit of God on the ground.

193
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,800
 God was calling his people back to intimacy with him.

194
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 And we learned that week that all of our Exoduses, God doesn't call us to stand back and watch.

195
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,120
 He invites us to draw in and connect.

196
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,840
 God wants us to be close and intimate with him.

197
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,520
 Exodus is not something where we go, "Oh wow, that's cool."

198
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,920
 Exodus is an intimate, personal journey with God.

199
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,200
 Well not surprisingly, Moses in the rest of chapter 3 kind of freaks out a little bit.

200
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,640
 And he kind of comes before God and he says, "I don't know if I'm adequate to do this.

201
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,120
 I don't know if I've got the skills to do this.

202
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,360
 I can't talk properly.

203
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,120
 I'm not very much a good leader.

204
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,640
 I've actually killed somebody before.

205
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,840
 My resume is pretty bad."

206
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,560
 And God begins to speak to him and says, "It doesn't really matter about your resume.

207
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,920
 What actually matters is about what I'm about to do with you.

208
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,400
 And here's the hard thing, Moses.

209
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,240
 I'm going to call you to go back to the very place that you fled from.

210
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,800
 I'm going to call you to go back to the very place of your brokenness.

211
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,480
 Because unless you go back there, unless you go to the very root of the place of your brokenness,

212
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
 there will be no liberation.

213
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,720
 There will be no freedom for you."

214
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,560
 And we learned something that week that I think is so important that we have to understand.

215
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,080
 That our Exodus doesn't begin when we have it all sorted out.

216
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,680
 Our Exodus actually begins when we take the very things that we have and allow those things

217
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
 to be before God.

218
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,160
 When we actually go back to the very places of our greatest brokenness and have the strength

219
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
 to do so.

220
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,760
 Our Exodus actually begins when we're willing to break away from our comfort and step towards

221
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,000
 the unknown.

222
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 That's how it starts.

223
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,480
 You see, it would have been easy for them to stay in the place of comfort.

224
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,840
 But there was no Exodus for Moses in the place of comfort.

225
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,760
 His comfort was the desert where he had raised a new family.

226
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,920
 And God says, "No, you need to go back to Egypt and get into a place where you're uncomfortable,

227
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,360
 where you're going to have to deal with some of the stuff that is buried deep inside of

228
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
 you.

229
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,720
 Only then will you be truly free."

230
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,760
 And we learned that that has to be our journey too.

231
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,640
 As hard as it might be, we have to allow the Holy Spirit to uproot the deepest things in

232
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,320
 us if we truly want to be free.

233
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,480
 Well in chapter 4, Moses turns to God and says, "Well, how am I going to do this?"

234
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,120
 God says to Moses, "Well, what is in your hand?"

235
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,680
 And he realizes he's got a shepherd's staff in his hand and God begins to do all these

236
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,880
 crazy things with the shepherd's staff in his hands.

237
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,120
 And he's trying to teach Moses something that we learned that week.

238
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,480
 That it's not actually, again, about who we are having it all together.

239
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,880
 It's actually about this reality that in taking the things that God has given us, even the

240
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,360
 broken things in us, and relinquishing control of them, that's when God can step in and begin

241
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
 to do it.

242
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,480
 And we learned that week that some of us actually don't move into Exodus because we're trying

243
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,520
 to control, we're trying to establish that control for ourselves.

244
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,460
 And it's in the relinquishing of control, giving it to God, that we actually enable

245
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:02,760
 Him to show us what control truly looks like, being free with Him.

246
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,840
 Also in the confidence of this idea that God is with them.

247
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,120
 In chapter 5, Moses and Aaron, they actually go before Pharaoh for the first time and they

248
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,840
 say, "Let my people go."

249
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,760
 It's a bold, declarative statement and Pharaoh's like, "Who are you?

250
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,600
 Who are you?

251
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
 Who is this God?

252
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,720
 I don't know this God.

253
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,320
 I'm not going to let your people go.

254
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,640
 In fact, just because of your arrogance and asking that, I'm going to double down on my

255
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,800
 slavery for them.

256
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,080
 I'm going to make it even worse for them."

257
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,920
 And we learned that week that sometimes in our journeys of Exodus, it actually gets worse

258
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
 before it gets better.

259
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,360
 It's not always a straight path, that there are curves and there are twists and sometimes

260
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,800
 it's harder before it gets better.

261
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,160
 And at the end of chapter 5, it's really difficult for Moses and Aaron because not only does

262
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,600
 Pharaoh hate them, but their own people start to hate them as well.

263
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,000
 "Oh, you've come here to try to help us, but now you're making it worse for us."

264
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,720
 At the beginning of chapter 6, there's this cry in Moses and Aaron.

265
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,080
 They feel disillusioned and they feel hated and they feel hurt and they feel like they've

266
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,400
 been a failure.

267
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,200
 And God shows up again with His compassion and says, "Just you wait."

268
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,280
 He says, "You have to understand my heart and my nature.

269
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,960
 You have to understand who I am and how I stand with you.

270
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
 I'm going to do some things.

271
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,640
 And just because I call you into freedom, it doesn't mean the journey is going to be

272
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,480
 pain-free.

273
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,200
 Just because I call you into a place of freedom, it doesn't mean it's going to be easy, pain-free,

274
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
 suddenly like this.

275
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
 I'm not Santa Claus, I'm God.

276
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,400
 And I'm going to come and work in such a way that over time you're going to be rebuilt

277
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,720
 to the person that I want you to be, but it's going to require a submission to the journey

278
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
 that I have you on."

279
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,960
 And in chapter 6, he tells them what that journey is going to be like.

280
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,640
 He says, "I'm going to take you as my own children.

281
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,960
 I'm going to bless you.

282
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,640
 I'm going to break off the chains from you, and then I'm going to give you new life."

283
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:57,160
 And he lays out the process of Exodus, this idea of taking, blessing, breaking, and giving.

284
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,760
 And we saw that week that when Jesus is in the upper room just before he's about to get

285
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,480
 arrested and he's doing the Passover meal with his disciples, he picks up from Exodus

286
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,280
 chapter 6 that process.

287
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,920
 And he takes the bread in the cup, and he blesses it, and he breaks the bread, and he

288
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,000
 gives it to his disciples, saying, "This is the way that freedom and liberation always

289
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 come.

290
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,560
 This is what the cross of Jesus is going to be about.

291
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,160
 The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus is an Exodus for everybody, because God takes,

292
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,960
 he blesses, he breaks, and he gives.

293
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
 Amen."

294
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,880
 Wow, that was about 10 weeks of teaching in 5 minutes.

295
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,200
 Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

296
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
 All right.

297
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,880
 You're caught up on Exodus.

298
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,680
 But the question is, what happens next?

299
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,960
 And as we step into chapter 7 today, we step into this moment where Aaron and Moses are

300
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,720
 called once again to go before Pharaoh and say, "Let my people go."

301
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,400
 Can you imagine how they must have felt?

302
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,360
 I mean, this must have been the worst thing for them.

303
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,800
 Because last time when they went before Pharaoh and said, "Let my people go," Pharaoh doubled

304
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,560
 down on his slavery on the Israelites.

305
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,600
 And now here they are, and God says, "Okay, it's time to go again.

306
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,120
 You're going to go in front of Pharaoh again."

307
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,400
 And you're probably thinking, Moses and Aaron, if you're Moses and Aaron, you're probably

308
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,560
 thinking this, "I don't know if this is going to work."

309
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,560
 Are you with me?

310
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:30,720
 And perhaps, as we start this 14-week journey ahead of us, and as I've been standing here

311
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,120
 telling you that this is going to be the most transformative thing in your life and that

312
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,920
 God is going to move you into new freedoms that you've never felt before, perhaps some

313
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,760
 of you, maybe you're into the Exodus and you've been following the series and everything's

314
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,960
 been great so far, but there's something in your mind where you're like, "I don't know

315
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,080
 if this is going to work.

316
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,760
 I don't know if God's really going to come through for me."

317
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,760
 And the same feeling that Moses and Aaron felt as they stepped before Pharaoh again

318
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,840
 is perhaps the same feeling that many of us in this room feel as we step into these 14

319
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
 weeks.

320
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
 "I don't know if God's really going to do this.

321
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,560
 I'd like to get freedom from my addiction.

322
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,840
 I'd like to leave those pains behind me, but I'm not even sure if I can do that.

323
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,040
 I'm not sure if God's going to do it.

324
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,480
 I'm not sure if He's going to come through."

325
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,840
 And we're filled with this questioning.

326
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,800
 And if that's you, I want you to know you're in a good place, because Moses and Aaron had

327
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 no idea as they stepped towards Pharaoh in chapter 7 what was going to happen in 7, 8,

328
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
 9, and 10.

329
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,600
 They had no idea that the plagues were going to come, that the Passover would happen, that

330
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,440
 God would redeem them and release them, that they would see the waters of the Red Sea parted,

331
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,320
 that they would go to Sinai and receive the law.

332
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,920
 I mean, they had no idea about everything that we know is in the story ahead.

333
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,020
 And I want you to understand that you have no idea what God has reserved for your story

334
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,160
 in the next 14 weeks.

335
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,040
 He's got so much ahead.

336
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,240
 It's almost like if God could take you and plug you into His brain to see everything

337
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,600
 that's about to happen for you in the next 14 weeks, you'd be, "Woohoo!"

338
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,280
 But maybe right now you're like, "I'm not even sure if this is going to work."

339
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
 Anyone with me?

340
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:15,320
 So I want to pray as we open God's Word together today that God will make this work for you.

341
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,740
 Father, I just thank you so much for the people in this room online, the overflow, and anywhere

342
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,220
 else that they're listening.

343
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,940
 Father, we just are grateful that you are at work.

344
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,860
 And Lord, we come to you like Moses and Aaron, maybe with that question, "I don't know.

345
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,060
 I don't know if I can get free from this."

346
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:40,420
 But Lord, we come to you also in that faith, that little mustard seed of faith that Moses

347
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:47,980
 and Aaron had, knowing that you can do immeasurably more than we could ever ask or imagine.

348
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,980
 We thank you for this.

349
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,980
 In Jesus' name, amen.

350
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,980
 Let me read this to you.

351
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,980
 Everybody okay?

352
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,300
 All right.

353
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,340
 This is Exodus chapter 6, starting 28 into chapter 7.

354
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,780
 "Now when the Lord spoke to Moses in Egypt, he said to him, 'I am the Lord.

355
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,060
 Tell Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, everything I'm about to tell you.'

356
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:11,260
 But Moses said to the Lord, 'Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh l-l-l-l-listen

357
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,980
 to me?'"

358
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,780
 I added a little bit there, by the way, for dramatic effect.

359
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,900
 "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother

360
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,860
 Aaron will be your prophet.

361
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,800
 You are to say to him, 'Everything I command you and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh

362
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,460
 to let the Israelites go out of his country.'

363
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,140
 But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my miraculous signs and wonders

364
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,420
 in Egypt, he will not listen to you.

365
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,420
 Then I will lay my hand on Egypt, and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my

366
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,900
 divisions, my people, the Israelites, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord.

367
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:53,300
 When I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it, Moses and

368
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,020
 Aaron did just as the Lord commanded them."

369
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,300
 An amazing set of Scriptures here.

370
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,180
 And in here is the starting point of the liberation phase of Exodus.

371
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,420
 Because in here we see some pretty interesting things.

372
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,180
 We see an idea of hardened hearts, and we see a man who has faltering lips and God telling

373
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,020
 him to do it anyway.

374
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,660
 We see judgment and justice, and we see things that maybe when we read it we're like, "That

375
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,700
 sounds a little harsh.

376
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,620
 How does that all work out?"

377
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,700
 And here's the crazy thing.

378
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,380
 The thing that actually unlocks this passage is not actually a deeper dive into God himself.

379
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,880
 The thing that actually unlocks this passage is a deeper dive into Pharaoh.

380
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,220
 Because so much of what God does in just these small verses right here is related to who

381
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,660
 Pharaoh was and the kind of culture in which Pharaoh operated.

382
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,300
 And so to understand these passages here, we have to actually understand a bit more

383
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,840
 about Pharaoh.

384
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,140
 And to help you with that, I want to take you back to Egypt now, back to the very land

385
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,380
 of the Pharaohs.

386
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,860
 And I want to take you to one of the most famous places in all the world so that you

387
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,620
 can understand a bit more about the culture that surrounded Pharaoh himself.

388
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:11,540
 Let's have a look.

389
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,780
 Pharaoh.

390
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,220
 It was a title that demanded respect, power, and fear.

391
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,820
 Originally derived from the Egyptian compound, which means "great house," the title came

392
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,460
 to mean the "Great High One" or the ruler of the Great High House.

393
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,440
 It was used as early as the first dynasty and designated to the one person in Egyptian

394
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,340
 society who had all ruling power and authority over everyone else.

395
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,960
 He owned all the land in Egypt, enacted all the laws, collected all the taxes, and defended

396
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,600
 Egypt from invaders as the commander-in-chief of the army.

397
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:55,620
 In other words, he was the central figure to all Egyptian life, culture, and society.

398
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,060
 But importantly, he was more than that.

399
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,820
 You see, in Egyptian life, religion was central to absolutely everything.

400
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,260
 And one of the important roles that Pharaoh played was an intermediary between the gods

401
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,160
 and humans themselves.

402
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,820
 So for example, in any religious ceremony in ancient Egypt, Pharaoh deputized for the

403
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,820
 gods.

404
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,540
 And in this way, Pharaoh was not just in control of all of the practical life of Egypt.

405
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,660
 He was actually in control of all of the spiritual life as well.

406
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,300
 When Pharaoh acted, it was as if the gods themselves were acting.

407
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:41,940
 And in this way, Pharaoh was in control of the whole universe.

408
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,060
 So not surprisingly, the pharaohs lived in unparalleled grandeur and splendor.

409
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,000
 In life, their palaces were designed to project power and abundance.

410
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,540
 And in death, their pyramids were designed to do so for all eternity.

411
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,380
 The pharaohs surrounded themselves with only what was fitting for one who was a god, and

412
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,460
 that was vast displays of glorious wealth and opulence.

413
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,300
 A simple case in point can be found right here near the Sphinx in Giza.

414
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,340
 Well, none of those ancient palaces are still intact today.

415
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,700
 But throughout Egypt, you can actually discover elements of their wealth.

416
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,860
 And I want to show you one of those examples right here.

417
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,660
 This pillar is actually made of a red granite.

418
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,620
 And this red granite is not found in any quarries in Egypt at all.

419
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,500
 In fact, scholars believe that these pieces of granite were actually sourced from Southern

420
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:39,100
 Africa, placed on boats, sent up the Nile River, and then finally constructed here in

421
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
 Cairo.

422
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,580
 Now, get your head around that, because all of that is designed to communicate one simple

423
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,380
 thing, that anyone who ever comes into this place would know, that the person who owns

424
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,820
 it is really, really, really powerful.

425
00:25:52,820 --> 00:26:13,300
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

426
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:19,780
 So a pharaoh who was god, and a palace outrageous in its opulence and wealth, all designed to

427
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,580
 communicate power, prestige, and authority.

428
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,140
 So stop for a moment and think what it would have been like for Aaron and Moses to receive

429
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,380
 the call of God to go to Pharaoh and command the Israelites to be let go.

430
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,060
 And then stop and think what it would have been like for them to walk into the actual

431
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:43,260
 palace, to be surrounded by all that power and wealth, and actually only being there

432
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,980
 with the clothes on their backs and those two staffs in their hands.

433
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,940
 Do you imagine how much fear they must have felt?

434
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,620
 But then here's the crazy thing.

435
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,260
 They're in that palace, and they're confident.

436
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,060
 They're putting their trust and their faith in God, that even in the place of Pharaoh's

437
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,900
 greatest comfort and authority, he would actually bend to their will.

438
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,120
 I mean, none of that actually makes sense.

439
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,460
 And I've come to think that faith often operates that way, often in a place where things don't

440
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,460
 make sense.

441
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,340
 I mean, I think you could actually define faith like this, "radical obedience amidst

442
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,860
 crazy overwhelming odds."

443
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:27,500
 Or put it in Moses and Aaron's terms, "two feeble shepherd's staffs against red granite

444
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
 pillars."

445
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,220
 Now, the question you have to ask yourself is simply this, "Would you have gone?"

446
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:57,340
 It really is staggering to me, the faith that they must have had.

447
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,460
 Oh, thank you.

448
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,860
 It's really staggering to me how they must have felt walking into that place, believing

449
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,740
 that Pharaoh might respond, dressed in their shepherd's clothes with their little staffs

450
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,340
 amongst all that opulence and power and wealth.

451
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,100
 And in fact, Moses, when he's telling you the story, he's honest about it.

452
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,420
 He says these things.

453
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,740
 He says, "I'm a person of faltering lips.

454
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,200
 How am I going to be able to do this?"

455
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,180
 But then on the other side, God says, "I am the Lord.

456
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,740
 Go to Pharaoh and tell him what I'm about to tell you."

457
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:31,940
 There's this tension in the passage between how Moses felt about himself and his own inadequacies

458
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,900
 and how God was, and how God was calling Moses not to focus on his resume, but to focus on

459
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,820
 God, to focus on who he is.

460
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,020
 And he was saying, "When you go before Pharaoh, you don't go in the strength of your own power.

461
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,280
 You don't go in the strength of how smart you are.

462
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,420
 You don't go in the gifts and the talents that you have.

463
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,340
 You go literally in obedience.

464
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,980
 You go in faithfulness.

465
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,020
 And when you go, I am the Lord.

466
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,380
 I'm the one who's going to work.

467
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,820
 I'm the one who's going to be powerful.

468
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,100
 I'm the one who has all of that authority.

469
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,620
 You don't need any of that.

470
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,620
 You just need to be faithful."

471
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,140
 Which is crazy to me, because so often we don't think of it that way.

472
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,260
 We think it is about how strong we are.

473
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,420
 If I'm going to get my freedom, if God's going to give me Exodus, it's about how I deserve

474
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,420
 it.

475
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,320
 I need to prove that I deserve it to him, or I need to work really hard, or do more

476
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,460
 quiet times, or whatever it might be.

477
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,860
 We begin to think that it's defined by who we are.

478
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,260
 Oh, I'm a person of faltering lips.

479
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,140
 How could this ever happen?

480
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,600
 And God shows up and says, "It's not about you.

481
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,940
 It's not about your inadequacies."

482
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,900
 God never calls you to be adequate for the tasks that he puts before you.

483
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,340
 He calls you to be faithful.

484
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,840
 And being faithful, by its very definition, means you're not adequate.

485
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,540
 Because if you're adequate, you wouldn't need faith.

486
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,000
 You'd just do it.

487
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,100
 And you'd do it because you were adequate to do it.

488
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:00,380
 See, God puts us in situations, circumstances, where our adequacy is not enough to achieve

489
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,380
 freedom.

490
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,500
 You will not get lasting freedom in your life through your own adequacy.

491
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,020
 It'll only come through your faithfulness to what God calls you to do, even when it's

492
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,220
 above and beyond what you think you can be able to do.

493
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,880
 Are you with me, church?

494
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,300
 What really blows my mind about this whole scenario is that then God, later on in the

495
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,900
 passage, actually tells Moses and Aaron that although they're going to go and speak what

496
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,100
 God asked them to speak, they're going to fail.

497
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,260
 He says, "I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart, and he's not going to listen to you."

498
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,060
 Can you imagine what this is like for Moses and Aaron?

499
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,420
 It's like, "Okay, all right, we'll go.

500
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,380
 We'll be obedient to what you're asking for us, and we're going to get there.

501
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,740
 And you've already told us that it's going to fail.

502
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,620
 What's the point in going?"

503
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,060
 Are you with me?

504
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:50,440
 But it's because we humans define success so differently to how God does.

505
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,300
 We define success through achievement, through outcomes, through whether something works

506
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,180
 out or not, or we achieve something, or we win or not.

507
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,620
 And you can imagine Moses and Aaron going, "Well, if you told us this is going to fail,

508
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,780
 why would we even bother going in the first place?"

509
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,820
 And God's like, "I define success differently."

510
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:15,700
 God does not define success by what you achieve, but how you obey.

511
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,340
 That's the definition of success in God's eyes.

512
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:26,260
 And the number one thing that will set you up in the next 14 weeks towards your freedom

513
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:35,340
 will be the small, simple moments of obedience that no one ever knows about.

514
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,620
 I know firsthand that the greatest moments that I've ever had as a pastor have been moments

515
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:47,540
 that no one has ever seen, moments where I made a simple decision to close that website,

516
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:55,220
 a simple decision to write that check, a simple decision to whatever it might be in the workplace,

517
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,500
 whatever it might be here in church, whatever spiritual thing, those simple things that

518
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,740
 I did in my heart that no one else saw, no one else knew about, those are the places

519
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:10,140
 that when I get into heaven, God's going to go, "Wow, Andrew, you did that," not, "Look

520
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,100
 at how big of a church you had."

521
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,260
 Are you with me?

522
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,420
 Your success is defined by the obedience of your heart, not by the achievements of your

523
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,420
 hands.

524
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,980
 I'm going to say that again because I just made that up and it was pretty good.

525
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,620
 Your success is going to be defined by the obedience of your heart, not by the achievements

526
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,300
 of your hands in God's heart.

527
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,180
 Now notice what happens next.

528
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,940
 Chapter 7 verse 1, "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh,

529
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,060
 and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.

530
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:44,220
 You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let

531
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,180
 the Israelites go out of his country.'"

532
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,340
 Now this sounds like it's contradicting everything I just said because I just said it's not about

533
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:55,420
 Aaron and Moses' resumes and God's going to do it all, but then in the very next verse,

534
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,700
 God says, "I'm going to make you like God before Pharaoh," which kind of sounds like

535
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,020
 suddenly Moses is going to look like a god to Pharaoh.

536
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,820
 It suddenly sounds like suddenly Moses is going to be mighty and powerful and have it

537
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,020
 all together and Pharaoh is going to see him and go, "Oh my gosh, there's a greater God

538
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,020
 here than me."

539
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,620
 That's not exactly what's happening at all.

540
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,700
 In fact, the way to unpack this is to understand the Egyptian culture that sits behind it.

541
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,020
 See, whenever anybody went into the palace of Pharaoh and went towards the throne room

542
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:28,460
 with Pharaoh and had an audience with Pharaoh, they would always address Pharaoh by the deity

543
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,440
 of the god that they worshipped because Pharaoh was the representation of all the deities

544
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,980
 on earth.

545
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,180
 That's what we saw in the film, right?

546
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,220
 He represented all the deities.

547
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,260
 So if an Egyptian servant went to Pharaoh in his court, he would say, "Oh, great and

548
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,300
 mighty Ra," which was the sun god.

549
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,660
 "Oh, great and mighty Ra, I would love for you to do this for me," or, "This is what

550
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,100
 I say to you," or whatever.

551
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,700
 So Pharaoh would always be addressed by the deity that was being worshipped.

552
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,180
 Are you with me?

553
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,220
 So what God's doing here is really fascinating.

554
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:06,420
 He says, "I'm going to send you in, and Moses, you're going to be like God in Pharaoh's presence,

555
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,740
 and Aaron is going to be your prophet."

556
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:13,740
 In other words, there's suddenly going to be another deity in Pharaoh's presence.

557
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,940
 And he's not used to that because he's the only deity in the land.

558
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,960
 But I'm going to make you like God, a deity before him.

559
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,900
 And here's the crazy thing.

560
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,860
 That's going to completely subvert his power.

561
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,420
 That's going to completely change everything for him.

562
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,540
 And he's not going to know how to respond or react to that.

563
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,780
 And here's even the most beautiful thing.

564
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,460
 You're going to go and do this dressed in smelly shepherd's clothes, and you're going

565
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,660
 to be like God to him.

566
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:48,860
 And he's going to look at you, and he's going to go, "How can an impoverished nomadic shepherd

567
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,540
 be a representative of a god?"

568
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
 That's what he's going to think.

569
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,980
 How can this one be a representative of God?

570
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:02,100
 Have you ever been in a situation where you feel completely overwhelmed and completely

571
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
 inadequate?

572
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,060
 Recently, I was at this event.

573
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,020
 It was a small private fundraising event, and I was sitting on a table with eight people,

574
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,540
 and I had the responsibility of trying to raise some funds for a charity organization

575
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,860
 in the city.

576
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,380
 And around the table of eight people, three of them were US dollar billionaires.

577
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,500
 US dollar billionaires.

578
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,620
 I have never felt more insignificant in my life than sitting around a table with three

579
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,220
 US dollar billionaires who were incredibly powerful, incredibly successful, really nice

580
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,220
 people.

581
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,940
 I was hoping that they would be mean and angry and horrible, but they were really nice people

582
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
 too.

583
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,020
 Not only super wealthy, but nice.

584
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,340
 And I'm sitting there around this table, and I'm listening to their stories, and I'm feeling

585
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,780
 like I'm kind of like sliding under the table a little bit, you know, like.

586
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,460
 And as I'm sitting there, I honestly, I hear God's spirit whisper in my ear.

587
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:56,340
 How could an impoverished Hong Kong church shepherd be a representative of a God?

588
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:03,260
 And I felt like what God was saying is, do you understand where true power lies?

589
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,500
 And these were really nice people and great people, very successful people, which I really

590
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
 admire.

591
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,060
 But God was saying, true power does not lie in the things of this world.

592
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:17,700
 True power lies in salvation, redemption, and hope, and grace, and love.

593
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,820
 And I tell you, in this room, online, in the overflow, there are representatives of this

594
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,380
 God.

595
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,900
 You need to understand that when you're called into a situation where you feel inadequate,

596
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,900
 overwhelmed, when you're in a spirit of influence, where you feel like you don't have any power,

597
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:38,200
 the tendency naturally is for you to shrink away, but you need to rise up in those moments.

598
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,500
 You are a representative of the living God.

599
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,300
 Jesus has died and shed His blood so that you would know new life.

600
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,980
 The same spirit that was in Christ that raised Him from the dead is now in you.

601
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,860
 Take your stand.

602
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,940
 You're a representative of God's true hope.

603
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,140
 And I think Hong Kong more than ever needs people to go, "I am a representative of the

604
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,180
 one true God."

605
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,340
 That's not arrogant on our part, but that's us putting ourselves into a place where we

606
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:14,460
 can administer the hope of Christ, knowing that we are in Christ in the world.

607
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,260
 Are you with me?

608
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,220
 Now, very quickly, notice what happens next.

609
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:26,060
 Verse 3 says this, "But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and I will multiply my miraculous signs

610
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,140
 in wonders in Egypt.

611
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,780
 He will not listen to you."

612
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,660
 This is weird because they've been called to bring freedom.

613
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,060
 They've been called to ask for the Israelites to go, and then God says, "I'm going to harden

614
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,620
 Pharaoh's heart, and he's not going to listen to you."

615
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,660
 And scholars have debated for years and years and years around what does it mean for God

616
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,140
 to harden someone's heart?

617
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,940
 How do we get our heads around?

618
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:51,860
 Because on the surface, what it sounds like is how can a just God harden someone's heart

619
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,020
 and then punish them?

620
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
 That doesn't seem like a just God.

621
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,580
 It doesn't kind of seem like a God we would want to worship.

622
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,980
 What is happening here?

623
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,620
 Well, what's sitting behind all of this is the reality of judgment and the judgment that's

624
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,620
 going to come.

625
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,060
 I said earlier that compassion was the fuel for Exodus, but that doesn't mean that there

626
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,020
 wasn't judgment within the Exodus story.

627
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:15,020
 And we're going to see this week, next week, and the week after what that judgment turns

628
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,740
 to look like, tends to look like.

629
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,140
 But in this moment, God says, "I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart."

630
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,780
 It's important that you understand the word that Moses uses here.

631
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,980
 It's a Hebrew word, of course.

632
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,940
 It's the word k'cheh.

633
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,060
 The word literally means, or k'cheh, the word literally means to fasten a hold of or

634
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,940
 to strengthen something.

635
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,540
 Now what's really important about this is that you have to understand that for God to

636
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:44,140
 harden something with this word, what it means is that God strengthens the direction that

637
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,500
 something's already on.

638
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,300
 In other words, that there's already been a decision, there's already been a turning

639
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,060
 of the heart, there's already been a posture of the heart, and God is going to come and

640
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,100
 fasten, strengthen that direction.

641
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,180
 The modern day equivalent would be the idea of doubling down.

642
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,020
 Somebody's made a decision, and now they're doubling down on that decision.

643
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,580
 Does that make sense to you?

644
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,820
 So when it says that God hardens Pharaoh's heart, what it's really teaching us here is

645
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,480
 that God sees the direction of Pharaoh's heart.

646
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,560
 He looks into Pharaoh's heart, and he sees that he's already decided never to let the

647
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
 Israelites go.

648
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,140
 We know that because we've seen that in chapter 5.

649
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,500
 In chapter 5 where he said, "I don't know this God.

650
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,780
 I'm not going to bow to this.

651
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,780
 This is not going to happen."

652
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,660
 He's already set the direction of his heart.

653
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,380
 It's really important that you understand this.

654
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,900
 When it says in the text that God hardens Pharaoh's heart, it's not saying that God

655
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,460
 is making Pharaoh do something he doesn't want to do.

656
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,380
 It's not talking about God overtaking the free will of Pharaoh and suddenly taking a

657
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:45,720
 soft pliable loving heart and making it hard and nasty so that he can punish him.

658
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,460
 What it's saying is the direction of Pharaoh's heart had already been made up.

659
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:54,020
 The decision had already been made, and God's going to fasten that, strengthen that so that

660
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,300
 it'd be brought into a place of judgment.

661
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,540
 I want you to see the judgment element of this.

662
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,660
 Verse 4 onwards, "Then I will lay my hand on Egypt, and with mighty acts of judgment

663
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,380
 I will bring out my divisions, my people, the Israelites."

664
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,260
 Again, to understand this, you have to understand the Egyptian cultural context here.

665
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:17,000
 At the time that Moses is standing in front of Pharaoh, there was already in circulation

666
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,020
 what was called the Book of the Dead in Egypt.

667
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,840
 The Book of the Dead was a story of lots of different deities and how they interacted

668
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
 with humanity.

669
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,580
 One of those deities was Anubis.

670
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:33,300
 Anubis was the deity of the decision of the future, the eternal future of people.

671
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,860
 In this story that's found in the Book of the Dead, this person called Ammi comes before

672
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,780
 Anubis, a little bit like in a throne room like Pharaoh.

673
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,140
 As Ammi comes before Anubis, Anubis is going to make a judgment as to whether Ammi will

674
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,140
 have eternal good life or eternal bad life.

675
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:53,300
 The way that he judges, as you can see in this beautiful hieroglyphic, is he takes his

676
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,140
 heart and he places his heart on a scale.

677
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,120
 Then on the other side of the scale, there's a feather that's placed there.

678
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,620
 It's the feather of righteousness.

679
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,300
 That's what it's called in the Book of the Dead.

680
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,980
 There's this heart of Ammi on one side of the scale and the feather of righteousness

681
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,020
 in the other.

682
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:14,300
 The idea is that Anubis is going to judge the heaviness of Ammi's heart.

683
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,140
 If that heart has any evil in it, if that heart has any evil actions in it, then the

684
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:23,620
 scales are going to tip in the wrong balance and then he'll be sentenced to a life of death.

685
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,020
 That's basically the way it worked within the Egyptian thinking.

686
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:33,180
 Now God knows all of this and he picks up on all of this and he says to Moses, "Aaron,

687
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,380
 you're going to go and I'm going to judge Pharaoh.

688
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,100
 I'm going to harden his heart because he's already made a decision.

689
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:44,020
 The scales already are imbalanced and I'm going to show that the scales reveal that

690
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,980
 Pharaoh's heart is wanting."

691
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,620
 By whether you look at it through the Hebrew culture where they know that Pharaoh's heart

692
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:55,500
 is bad because of their slavery for so many years or if you look at it through the Egyptian

693
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,900
 culture which already understands that there's a scale of righteousness that has to be balanced,

694
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,740
 Pharaoh's heart is wanting.

695
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:10,900
 God is saying, "I'm going to judge that heart publicly in Egypt so that all the Egyptians

696
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:18,620
 will see exactly this, that there is an imbalance of the scales of Pharaoh's heart."

697
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,620
 Because actions are just, whether you look through the Hebrew lens or the Egyptian lens

698
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,780
 of the actions and thoughts that were in his heart.

699
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,780
 Is that helpful?

700
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,780
 Now, I want you…

701
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,780
 We're finally…

702
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,780
 We're finishing here.

703
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,780
 I know I'm almost done.

704
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,780
 Are we okay for five more minutes?

705
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,460
 This is the best five minutes so that's why I want you to be here.

706
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:43,900
 Says this, verse five, "And then the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I stretch

707
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,820
 out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it."

708
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,620
 So why does God judge?

709
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,900
 Why is God going to judge the weight of Pharaoh's heart?

710
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,180
 Why does he harden the heart in order to show that judgment, to show the direction that

711
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,900
 Pharaoh had already decided in his own free will?

712
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,900
 It's so that Egypt would come to know that I'm God.

713
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,540
 Now when you read it like you see it on the screen here, it almost sounds like God's

714
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,340
 like, "I'm going to judge Pharaoh and all of Egypt so they will know that I am the

715
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,340
 mighty God."

716
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:17,660
 You know, like it almost has this kind of resonance of like that evil laugh to it, right?

717
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,380
 It's not what God is doing here.

718
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:25,940
 What's fascinating to me is that the word that Moses chooses for "will know" is

719
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,540
 the very same word that's used to speak of biblical marriage and the intimacy physically

720
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,900
 that's found in biblical marriage, to know someone.

721
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,160
 In other words, it's an incredibly intimate word.

722
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,700
 It's a word that is defined by relationship and personal invitation.

723
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,220
 So God is not saying, "I'm going to judge Pharaoh in Egypt so that everybody will know

724
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,540
 how bad they are."

725
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,100
 He's saying, "I'm going to judge Pharaoh and I'm going to judge Egypt so through the

726
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:59,020
 judgment all will come to know, would know intimately, personally be available to come

727
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,300
 into relationship with me."

728
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,940
 This is Him offering grace.

729
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,580
 This is Him saying that there is this grace element to it.

730
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,200
 There is judgment, but mercy triumphs over judgment.

731
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,460
 We come to see that in its fullness in the work of Jesus Christ, but even here in the

732
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,060
 first Exodus, we see mercy triumphing over judgment.

733
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,580
 Yes, there will be judgment.

734
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,860
 Yes, the heart is hard.

735
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,860
 Yes, the heart needs to be dealt with, but there is mercy that is coming and that mercy

736
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,300
 is even for the Egyptians.

737
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,900
 And here's the crazy thing.

738
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:33,060
 In Exodus chapter 12, verse 38, a whole bunch of Egyptians go with Israel to the promised

739
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:40,900
 land of their own free choice because they had come to know, to see, and to taste that

740
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,580
 the Lord is good.

741
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:49,420
 So what does all this have to say to you as we start this second phase of our Exodus

742
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,740
 series?

743
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:57,180
 You need to understand that God indeed has the prerogative and the ability to take a

744
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:06,540
 hard heart and harden it, but He also has the power to take a hard heart and soften

745
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,980
 it.

746
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:16,400
 He also is a God who is able to offer to the Egyptians themselves, the ones who had

747
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:26,240
 enslaved His people for close to 400 years, and say, "If there is a kernel, a mustard

748
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,800
 seed of your desire to turn towards me, I will soften your heart."

749
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,720
 Pharaoh's heart had been made up.

750
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,920
 His heart was already there.

751
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,920
 God had already perceived that there was no mustard seed of faith or hope or turn or change

752
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,640
 for Pharaoh, so He hardens His heart towards that aim.

753
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:51,080
 But for everybody else, everybody in Egypt, the offer was there.

754
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:56,200
 Would you allow me to soften your heart so that you would know that I am your God?

755
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,640
 As we start this second phase of Exodus, that's the call on us too.

756
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,360
 Because if you're anything like me, your heart has moments of great, beautiful softness and

757
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,880
 joy and it also has parts of hardness to it.

758
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,720
 And perhaps you're here today and you recognize that there is some hardness in your heart

759
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,520
 too.

760
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,080
 This whole passage has been about God examining the heart.

761
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,080
 He doesn't look at the surface.

762
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,480
 He doesn't look at the resume.

763
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,660
 He doesn't look at the achievements.

764
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,880
 He looks constantly at the heart of humanity.

765
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,040
 And He looks at Pharaoh's heart and says, "Hmm."

766
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,240
 But He looks at your heart.

767
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,060
 And He looks at even the hard parts of your heart.

768
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,840
 And He looks at your hope and your faith and your desire for His mercy.

769
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,720
 And He has the power to take even the hard things in you and soften them.

770
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,640
 For some of you, your hearts are hard because it's been years of pain and hurt from something

771
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,080
 that's happened to you in the past.

772
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,520
 For others, your heart's hard because you're continuing to make choices, habits and choices

773
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,920
 that bring you into sin and harden your heart.

774
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:04,220
 Whatever it might be for all of us, God's grace, His goodness can soften even the hardest

775
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,220
 parts of who we are.

776
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:11,940
 And the number one thing that you begin the liberation phase of Exodus in is to bring

777
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,300
 your heart before God and say, "I want to know you.

778
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,280
 I really want to know you.

779
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,820
 And I know that in the work of judgment and justice, you take all the things in my heart

780
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,060
 and you judge them fairly.

781
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,260
 But your ultimate heart is to know.

782
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,300
 It's for me to know you and you to know me."

783
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,620
 And that's how I want to pray for you as we start this journey together.

784
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:41,620
 I wonder whether you'd stand with me and I'm going to pray for us.

785
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:46,140
 And if this has been helpful for you today, through all the things that we've looked at,

786
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,820
 I want to invite you just to open your hands with me.

787
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,460
 And Father, we come before you now in this moment.

788
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,260
 And Father, we come before you with our hearts.

789
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:05,620
 And Father, if the people in this room online, Overflow, or anything like me, there's parts

790
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,220
 of our hearts that are hard.

791
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:13,540
 And there might be lots of different reasons why that's the case, but the reality is there's

792
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,240
 hardness there.

793
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,360
 As we were praying before the service, we particularly had the idea that some people's

794
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:26,140
 hearts are hard because of the way that they feel about family members.

795
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,500
 Maybe there's been an argument in your family or with your children or your spouse or with

796
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,900
 a relative in your wider circle of your family, and there's, maybe you haven't talked to them

797
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,220
 for years, maybe there's just something there and there's a hardness in your heart towards

798
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,220
 them.

799
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:43,260
 And again, maybe for some very good reason for some of you, but the hardness is still

800
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,540
 there.

801
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:52,180
 The Holy Spirit says, "If you really want to be free, allow me to come and weigh your

802
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,180
 heart."

803
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:58,380
 And you see, because of Jesus Christ, there's no feather of righteousness.

804
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,660
 We don't follow the book of dead.

805
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:04,180
 We follow Jesus Christ, his life, death, and resurrection.

806
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:11,060
 So no matter how heavy, how hard our hearts might be, his scales always balance in our

807
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,020
 favor.

808
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,780
 And the grace of Christ has been offered to you.

809
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:22,700
 The blood of Jesus shed for you so that you would always know the softness that comes

810
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,880
 by his Spirit, his forgiveness, and his grace.

811
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,820
 And so if you're here today and there's some hardness there, your starting point of Exodus

812
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:38,100
 in the second part of the series is just to invite God to come and soften you.

813
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:47,140
 Half the battle is just owning the hardness, to say, "There is this part of me that I struggle

814
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,140
 to deal with.

815
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,140
 I struggle to make soft."

816
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:58,700
 Holy Spirit, I come to you today, and I ask you, I confess, I recognize the hardness,

817
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:05,380
 and I ask you now to come and over the next 14 weeks, soften that hardness in me.

818
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,980
 I can't do it in my own strength.

819
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:14,460
 I'm not adequate enough for the task set before me, but you are God.

820
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,460
 You are God.

821
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,300
 You could do abundantly more than I could ever ask or imagine.

822
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,380
 Soften me, Lord.

823
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,540
 Soften me, Lord, because I want to be free.

824
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,860
 Take a moment just to bring that prayer before the Lord, and then we're going to close our

825
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,860
 time in some worship together.

826
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,860
 together.
