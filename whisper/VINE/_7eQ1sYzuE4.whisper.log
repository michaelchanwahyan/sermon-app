[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180]   So help us to receive that we make room for your word and so Jesus. Thank you in your name. We pray. Amen
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.200]   Welcome everyone and welcome to everyone who's joining us online
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.800]   Some weeks ago
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.840]   One of my daughters my son and I were returning home and as we came up to our apartment building
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.240]   you have to scan your octopus card to get in it's specially linked and
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:39.360]   In previous years if you were a family unit and you're coming in just one of you needed to zap your card and
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.880]   You know, you could all enter but lately they've gotten really strict and they've been wanting everyone to
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.480]   Touch their card as they come in
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.520]   So as we came up to the doorway my son and my daughter were in front of me
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.120]   I was behind them. I had my earphones in and I was watching on my phone
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.520]   one of the loves of my life rugby
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.520]   So I was completely immersed in this game and and
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.700]   My two children were in front of me and they both went and zapped their cards and I just followed in behind them
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.360]   I did not zap my card and the elderly security guard. He he saw me and he pointed at the machine like
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.040]   You need to zap your card
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.240]   and I ignored him and
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.880]   Kept walking and I kind of pointed to my son and daughter like I'm with them and I must have made a noise something like
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.880]   huh, and
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.960]   It must have been a little bit loud because my son immediately turned around to me and he said
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.440]   That was really rude
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.320]   And
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.480]   So when Andrew asked me to speak on this message of living a life worthy of the calling of God
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.600]   And I'm somebody that's still being held accountable
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.120]   in the way I walk and live by my son I
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.760]   Was like writing back to Andrew going, you know, I'll do this
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.680]   but you need to know that this is very much something that I'm wrestling with and I'm a work in progress and
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.480]   He replied back to me. He said yes, that's the honesty that we need
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.680]   So today I'll be sharing with you some things that
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.400]   Are at work within me and I hope that they will be an encouragement to you as well
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.680]   let's read Ephesians 4 verses 1 to 10 as
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.800]   A prisoner for the Lord then I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.600]   Be completely humble and gentle be patient
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.000]   Bearing with one another in love make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.800]   There is one body and one spirit just as you were called to one hope
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.840]   When you were called one Lord one faith one baptism
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.040]   One God and father of all who is overall and through all and in all but to each one of us
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.280]   Grace has been given as Christ apportioned it
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.280]   This is why it says when he ascended on high he took many captives and gave gifts to his children
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.300]   What does he ascended mean except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions?
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.560]   He who descended is the very one who ascended
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.640]   Higher than all the heavens in order to fill the whole universe
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.320]   I'd like to focus first on Ephesians 4 verse 1 as a prisoner for the Lord then I urge you
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.720]   To live a life worthy of the calling you have received
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.760]   The New King James Version says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.440]   beseech you to walk worthy of the calling with which you are called
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.200]   What word or words do you focus on when you hear these verses?
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.440]   My eyes get drawn to the word worthy
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.120]   Walk worthy live worthy and lately I found myself
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.320]   Measuring myself and asking myself am I living a life that is worthy enough?
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:36.480]   At times I felt guilty because I feel like I've not been doing enough that there are expectations
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   I'm not fulfilling
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.120]   I've wrestled with whether my life is turning out the way
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.160]   God intended it to I wonder if there's anyone here this morning. That's asked a similar question
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.360]   It's my life
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.920]   turning out the way
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   God intended it to
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.040]   Recently on one of my bus commutes to school and as you know if you've heard me preach before
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.640]   There's always something from my bus commutes to school. I felt God shift my focus in
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.040]   The verse away from the word worthy to the words walk and live
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:20.620]   God reminded me in a profound way that our worthiness has nothing to do with us
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:28.840]   We cannot do anything to walk more worthy or live more worthy
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.400]   We have been made worthy through an act of grace an
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.860]   undeserved lavish gift of love
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.320]   I'll say it again our worthiness has nothing to do with us
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.760]   It has everything to do with a precious gift of a son
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.440]   whose perfection and
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.320]   goodness
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.640]   Covers us as we walk out our sanctification journey
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.960]   Paul spends the first half of his letter
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.200]   Going into extravagant detail of the wondrous things God has done for us
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.800]   He chose us in love. He adopted us
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.960]   All of this freely given by God's extravagant grace
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:29.160]   Our eyes might be drawn to this word worthy and for some of us it may have made you feel disqualified
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.240]   But this is not what this verse is about
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.800]   It is not what Paul was trying to convey
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.720]   Commentators believe that Paul was under house arrest in Rome when he wrote this letter
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.240]   He was unable to walk and live freely and here
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.200]   He was telling and calling God's people to use their freedom to walk and live
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.280]   worthy of the calling they had received
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.200]   To walk and live in the calling of God has nothing to do with our worthiness. The calling is worthy
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.040]   Our primary calling is to be in a personal relationship with God
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:18.680]   to be a son or a daughter of God if we have received and
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.760]   Responded to this calling we have been made worthy
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.240]   So Paul's focus was not to call the people to worthiness this had already been achieved by them receiving and
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.320]   Responding to God's call to be in relationship with him
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.720]   Paul was urging them
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:47.520]   Beseeching them this word means to ask someone urgently or fervently to do something
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.960]   Paul was urging them to do something with this precious calling they had received
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.400]   To understand that this calling to become a son and daughter was not only for them
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.280]   It was for the church and the world around them
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:09.240]   He was imploring them to walk in it live it out do something with it
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:17.200]   Under house arrest Paul was well aware that his ability to walk and live out his calling had been somewhat limited
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.160]   His imprisonment had opened his eyes to how necessary
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.760]   It was that God's people did not waste their freedom
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.600]   Their opportunity to do something with this incredible gift
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.040]   This incredible calling they had received
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:43.760]   So in summation of this first verse the calling is worthy. It's the calling is worthy of our attention
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.280]   You do not have to be worthy
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:52.320]   In fact, you cannot ever be in your own strength or by your own endeavors
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.840]   Worthiness is a gift we receive when we choose
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.760]   Jesus
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.360]   Who traded his perfection?
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:08.960]   His worthiness for our ugliness our flaws our shame on the cross
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.360]   The calling is worthy our calling to be in relationship with God to listen and respond to his voice
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.840]   It requires our fervent and urgent
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.000]   attention
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.880]   We are required to do something in response to this precious gift
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:34.720]   Our calling begins in relationship with Christ and as the Holy Spirit works within us
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:43.720]   Drawing us closer to God. We inevitably get drawn closer to the focus of God's hearts, which is people
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.840]   We get drawn closer to each other
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:53.120]   We share God's heart for the people in our everyday lives in society and around the world
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.960]   So we are not called to do anything in our own strength
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.440]   Paul prays that the eyes of our heart
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.400]   May be enlightened in order that we may know his
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:13.440]   God's in care incomparably great power for us who believe the same power
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.720]   The mighty strength God used to raise Jesus from the dead
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.520]   lives within us
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.560]   Paul was wanting the believers of Ephesus to understand this power
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.920]   this power of the Holy Spirit at work within them and
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:37.640]   It is as we allow and respond to the work of the Spirit that God works
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.800]   inevitably
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.600]   Through our lives and his good works
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.320]   flow out of our lives
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:54.040]   From chapter 4 Paul begins to encourage the people in the church about the way in which they should walk and live in community
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:00.160]   He doesn't start by telling the believers in the church go out and do this
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:07.560]   Go out and do that. He actually starts by talking to them about their attitudes
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.400]   be completely humble and
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.000]   gentle
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Be patient
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.120]   bearing with one another in love
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.480]   Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.960]   Let's stop for a minute and take a reality check
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.560]   How strong are these qualities in our lives?
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:40.720]   Paul is writing to a church calling them to try hard to achieve unity and peace
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:47.560]   Reminding them that it can only be done if their lives are filled with humility
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.880]   gentleness
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.880]   patience and love
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.840]   Examine your attitudes of late
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:02.520]   Where do humility gentleness patience and love rank in your life? I
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.240]   Shared with you at the beginning
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.280]   one of my stories
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.600]   Think back on your weeks leading up to this day
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.640]   Where do humility gentleness patience and love
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:21.320]   rank in your life, what if your wife or husband or
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.800]   co-workers or children or
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:31.520]   Teachers or other people in the church or the people you ride public transport with
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.480]   What about your domestic workers
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.120]   What if they were to speak about your attitude?
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.800]   What would they say?
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:52.760]   To walk worthy of this incredible calling we've received to represent Christ as his sons and daughters
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   We need humility
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.600]   Gentleness
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   patience and love
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.880]   Now before any of us start thinking and striving or how do I do this? How do I get more?
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.600]   I've got to work harder
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.000]   I've got to have to get up earlier in the morning and do an extra hour of devotions
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.840]   Before any of us start striving and thinking that way
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.400]   Let us be reminded to start with the source
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   These qualities come from the heart of God
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.560]   Our primary calling is to be
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.480]   To be in relationship with God
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.960]   The Holy Spirit is great power within us
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.960]   Works to transform our hearts so that we will look like Jesus
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:50.120]   This is why Paul's prayer comes at the very beginning of his life
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:58.840]   Beginning of his letter. He's reminding us that all these qualities come from the heart of God and through
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.080]   relationship with him
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.600]   When we the people who make up the church
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:09.240]   allow God's humility and God's gentleness and God's patience and
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.400]   God's love to flow through us this place will shine
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.320]   Shine with unity created by a people who are at peace
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   Paul is wanting us to understand the urgency of this the necessity of this
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:31.200]   Because we the church are not the only ones in need of unity and peace
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:40.960]   Instead of humility gentleness patience love that results in unity and peace the world is suffering
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.160]   There is so much pride
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:53.120]   There is so much grasping for power and status and wealth a
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.120]   desperate need to control a
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:05.520]   Hardness of heart and a love that has become selfish and self-seeking
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:13.120]   Paul was urging the early church to endeavor to create the opposite spirit
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.560]   our challenge today is to be honest and
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   Ask ourselves are we?
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.600]   the people of the vine walking in
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.040]   humility and gentleness and patience and love
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:33.800]   Is there an opposite spirit in here to what exists out there?
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:40.880]   The word endeavor speaks of trying it speaks of effort and sometimes this is exactly
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.840]   What we do in our own strength we try we try we try
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:53.200]   Harder to love you know that person in our community group who seems to take up all the oxygen and all the attention
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:00.400]   We try harder to love that co-worker who rubs us up the wrong way
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:07.760]   We try we try we try because we know that we're meant to bear with one another in love
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:14.720]   We know we're not meant to get angry and frustrated. We feel the pressure. We should be able to do this. We're Christians
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:24.920]   Today if you're frustrated and worn out trying to be all things to all people take the pressure off
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.600]   Only God has love that has no limits
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.680]   Only God has love that has no limits
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.120]   But as you lean into him
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.560]   He gently draws you towards the other
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.640]   in love I
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:54.720]   Recently was listening to a podcast and the pastor shared it like this
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.880]   he said imagine a wheel of a bicycle and
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:05.200]   God is at the center of this bicycle and we are the spokes
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.320]   If I know what a spoke is
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.520]   They're those things that those metal
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.680]   Want to say wires but
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.080]   rods
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:22.360]   That go from the outer part of the wheel into the center of the wheel
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.200]   we are the spokes as
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.680]   We respond to the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.160]   We draw closer to God
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:38.640]   We draw closer to the center of that wheel and as that happens, we are inevitably drawn closer to
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.200]   each other
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:47.920]   With God's help we can endeavor to listen to each other in gentleness and patience
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.600]   Instead of promoting our own voices
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:58.240]   What areas of your life today lack peace and unity
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.520]   What areas of your life lack humility?
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.920]   gentleness
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:11.280]   Patience love is it in the area of your family?
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.200]   Your friends
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.040]   Your community group your work colleagues
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.640]   Your future
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.200]   Maybe you have no peace when you look at your future
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:35.520]   Maybe today you can choose to once again lean into the center of that bicycle wheel and
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.760]   As you are drawn near
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.320]   Allow the whispers of the Holy Spirit to show you
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.000]   How you can enter back into broken relationships?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.640]   with humility gentleness and love
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:57.680]   He can show you how to find ways to look at your future with renewed peace
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:03.280]   Together we can trust once again that unity and peace can be restored to our lives
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.080]   Paul reminds us that there is one body and one spirit
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:17.320]   Just as you were called to one hope when you were called one Lord one faith one baptism
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:23.440]   One God and father of all who's overall and through all and in all
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.440]   seven times the word one is used
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.680]   When people look at the church
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.680]   They should see oneness
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:42.080]   This is the state of being unified even though it is made up of many parts
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:50.640]   The world is fractured and divided full of people promoting their own agendas at the expense of others
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.720]   disunity and anxiety reign I
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:02.440]   Recently read an article written by Talia Valley in the fortune magazine and she said
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.600]   We are living in an age of selfishness
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:13.320]   Many of us notice an increase in selfish behavior during the early days of the pandemic
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:19.240]   At the time we may have written it off as a flash in the pan that would subside
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.320]   but it hasn't
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:30.180]   From rudeness in grocery stores to doors closing in your face rather than being held open by a stranger
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:35.520]   Behavior at a macro level seems to have fundamentally changed
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.160]   Living in an apartment block. I see this when you know
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:47.000]   There's people in the elevator and the doors are slowly closing and as people still coming and they're like pushing the button like close
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   close
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.840]   You're laughing you know what I'm talking about
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:21:01.200]   She goes on to state that psychologists often define selfishness in its simplest form as
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:07.200]   Its focus on the self over and above and even at the expense of others
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.000]   It's a focus on the one
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.760]   the one being
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.920]   yourself
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.360]   God's calling this calling that we've been given to live a life worthy
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:26.560]   His calling calls us to live in a different way
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:34.160]   To be that light on a hill that shows Hong Kong that shows the people in our lives a
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.720]   different way of living and walking
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:44.160]   This oneness in our churches and communities is achieved through close
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.960]   relationships with God that
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.320]   produce his qualities of
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.080]   humility and gentleness and patience and love in our lives
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:59.920]   And it's also achieved by remembering that we are all here because of grace
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.520]   Through no effort of our own
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.200]   Paul writes to each one of us grace has been given
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.480]   There's no hierarchy here
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.480]   We are all sons and daughters loved beyond measure
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:26.880]   Remembering the grace we walk in the grace we have been given should help us to freely give that same grace
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.600]   away
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:34.720]   To live a life worthy of the calling we have received we need each other
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:42.080]   Paul goes on to describe what happens when we all live a life worthy of the calling we have received
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.600]   The body of Christ is built up
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:52.360]   We all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God we become mature
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:23:00.880]   Attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ what a sweet picture of the body of Christ
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:07.920]   When we all choose to allow the Holy Spirit to move us closer to the heart of God
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:16.080]   When we deliberately choose to operate out of attitudes of humility and gentleness and patience and love
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.840]   This body this church then reflects the fullness of Christ
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:28.080]   Becoming the urgent answer of peace and unity the world is seeking
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:37.320]   So how do we respond today to this call to walk and live a life worthy of the calling we have received
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.440]   Do we respond with more effort and more striving?
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.520]   No
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.520]   We respond with more
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.920]   surrender
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.200]   Surrender to the one who wrote the pages of your life before you were born
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:59.880]   Who can supply you with all the power you need in relationship with him?
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.000]   He can shape your heart attitudes to match his own
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:13.320]   If you have stalled in your walk because of a sense of unworthiness of not being good enough of
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.760]   Not measuring up
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.880]   Then it's time to hold on to this truth
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:26.760]   Being able to walk in the calling you have received from God was never about your worthiness
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.080]   your ability or your strength
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.800]   We walk and live because of his worthiness
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:40.080]   Which he has freely given to us. We are draped in his worthiness
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.640]   clothed in his robes of
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.360]   righteousness
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.600]   Our worthiness for this journey we are on has been sorted
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.920]   You are good enough
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.200]   You are able
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.880]   You are strong enough because he has made you so
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.200]   However, we do need to partner with God to walk and live out our calling
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.280]   Some people have stalled today in your walk because you're waiting for a better time
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.320]   When maybe you're more prepared
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:18.720]   More financially stable waiting for more of maybe your flaws to be sorted out
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.680]   If you are waiting for perfection or perfect moments
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.920]   You'll be waiting forever
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:34.800]   Instead let the Holy Spirit shape your attitudes respond when he convicts you
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:41.360]   I'll give you another little story talking about responding when he convicts you
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.280]   Once again to do with travel on public transport
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.880]   It seems to be the area where God
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.760]   rubs his sandpaper over me
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:57.360]   so I'm waiting for the e41 which is the bus that takes me most of the way to where I work and
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.360]   Where we line up
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.000]   Somebody has kindly put these little chairs that you can sit on
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.800]   So the protocol is
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:15.360]   You know the first ones there they kind of sit in the chairs and when others arrive they kind of line up behind the chairs
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   You know like in the order that they arrive
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.440]   but the other morning I was sitting there and
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:28.080]   all the chairs were filled and there was one lady standing at the end of the chairs, we're waiting for the bus a
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.840]   Man rushes across the road and he just stands right at the front
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.240]   Like
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:42.160]   In my head like this conversation begins of what I will say to him
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:48.280]   About is he more important than all these other people who were before him
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:54.960]   And in my mind, I'm going through this scenario of like, you know, I should say something to this man
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:02.800]   We hop on the bus and he hops on the bus like hops on straight ahead goes ahead of all these people that were there before
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.760]   him and I've still got this conversation in my head and I sit down and
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.200]   Eventually God goes. Are you just you're just gonna continue doing that like
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.240]   having this conversation in your head about what you're gonna say this man and
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:22.560]   God challenged me to look at it with a different spirit
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:31.000]   You know, there's a verse in the Bible that says mercy triumphs over judgment and
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.600]   That's what I mean when I say
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.840]   Respond when God
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.280]   Convicts you
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.600]   Respond hear his whispers and go. Yeah, I'm wasting all my time and energy on this. I
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.040]   Need to pour mercy and grace into this
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:03.680]   When he convicts you and asks you to take off or remove things from your life respond
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.640]   when he prompts you
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:13.280]   Inevitably in the process you will discover that good works will spill out of your life
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:21.240]   Some of you today are struggling with peace and unity because the attitudes you are walking in do not
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.440]   reflect the heart of God
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:30.640]   Allow God room to get his hands on your impatience your frustration
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.760]   your anger
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.240]   Those ugly attitudes that dim your light
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:45.800]   Some of us here today need to be reminded that to walk and live worthy of the calling we have received we need each other
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:51.920]   Have you ever seen a bicycle wheel with one spoke
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.600]   That wheels not going far
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.560]   We need each other
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.040]   None of this works in isolation
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.440]   God works to draw us toward himself and to draw us towards each other
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.320]   We are a body and we need every part
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:18.200]   Working together bearing with one another in his love
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:24.280]   Some of us here today are worn out by this walk
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:30.760]   You've lost your joy become a bit numb to it all
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.000]   I
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.560]   Recently was reading a book
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.560]   I'm the teacher librarian at my school and I was reading this new book to the children and it was called
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.200]   hotel of feelings and
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.680]   in one of parts of the book the hotel manager
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:54.520]   Makes a statement where she says when I get overwhelmed by all these emotions that come to stay in the hotel
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.680]   I go outside and I sit in nature
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.240]   And she said and while I just sit there
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.960]   Looking at all the beauty around me
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.320]   gratitude comes and sits beside me and
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:16.760]   I was reminded of this when I was reading about this or thinking about this weariness that we get in life
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:23.040]   Sometimes we have to rediscover our gratitude. We have to sit a while
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.320]   Maybe it would be in nature
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.320]   Maybe it would be to sit in the first three chapters of Ephesians where Paul
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:36.680]   Outlines just the beauty of what we've received the wonder of it
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:43.960]   Oh just sit in it for a while and be reminded and and let gratitude come on sit beside you
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.680]   rediscover it
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.680]   But also Paul goes on in chapter 5 to say that
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:55.880]   Make sure that you are constantly filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   the
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.720]   Verb tense he uses in the Greek means go on being filled
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:10.640]   You see we might have been filled with the Spirit five years ago or two years ago or maybe even two weeks ago
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:14.840]   But Smith Wigglesworth said we are like leaky boats
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.520]   We get filled and then we leak
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:24.040]   This is why Paul I believe was saying
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.080]   Go on being filled
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:33.560]   Be filled again our prayer every day being fill me again Holy Spirit
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:40.880]   Continue to fill me as I walk into this day if you're weary be filled afresh
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.880]   Today
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:53.000]   We are going to make space today as we did last week to allow the Holy Spirit to move us closer to the heart of
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.720]   God and to each other I just invite the musicians to
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.560]   Come up. Would you stand with me?
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:13.280]   Would you just close your eyes with me
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.680]   If anything I have mentioned
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.320]   Has spoken to your heart. I just want you to
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.640]   Open your hands in front of you
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:36.560]   And we're just going to give some time for the Holy Spirit to to draw us near to the heart of God
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:42.160]   And maybe there's somebody here today you have never
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.000]   Started your journey with God
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.120]   You've never known that he loves you
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.760]   You've never known that
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:59.440]   He put pen to paper and wrote the pages of your life before you were born
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.680]   That there's no one better to lead you in this life than him
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:10.080]   If that's you today, then you can hold your hands open in front of you as well and
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.040]   choose Jesus
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:18.560]   Choose him to be the one that you want to walk your life with and he will come
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.560]   and he will stand with you and
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:28.960]   He will whisper to you and remind you of how precious you are to him
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:33.720]   For all of us
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:40.480]   I think all of us could open our hands for one thing or another or maybe five things
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.240]   As the worship team sing and worship
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:57.400]   And your hands are open in front of you I
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:07.040]   Pray that we can be a body together today that we can help meet each other's needs
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:16.920]   If there's somebody near you with their hands open I just encourage you to to support them
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   Support them in prayer
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:27.200]   Maybe support them with a gentle hand on the shoulder to let them know they're not alone in this journey
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.920]   None of us are meant to be alone in this journey
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:43.280]   So now we just make some space for the Holy Spirit to draw us closer to the heart of God
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   "I am the Spirit of the Lord" - Jesus Christ, the Lord of Hosts, 1 Cor. 2:17-21.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.280]   You
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.280]   You
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   You
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.000]   [MUSIC]
