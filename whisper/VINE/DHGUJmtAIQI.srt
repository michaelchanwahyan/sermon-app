 [ Music ]

2
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,300
 >> Well, we are in our final sermon for our series

3
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,980
 of Blowing Water.

4
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,240
 Are you ready?

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,080
 Let's welcome Pastor Ellison.

6
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,080
 [ Applause ]

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,280
 So, Ellison started us off.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,120
 Ellison curated this sermon series

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,100
 and Ellison will now finish.

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,260
 Can we pray for you?

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,040
 >> Yes, please.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,800
 >> Father, we thank you for Ellison and we thank you

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,540
 for his humility and for his prayerful approach

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,940
 to your throne room.

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,180
 I pray, Father God, now as he releases this word

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,480
 that our hearts would be open to receive truth.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,560
 In Jesus' name, amen.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,480
 >> Amen. Thank you, Carla.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,400
 Good morning, church.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,620
 It's good to be with you guys.

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,660
 We're celebrating my son's third birthday at home today.

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,840
 So, this morning there was a lot of bubbles

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,880
 and balloons and everything.

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,420
 Yeah, so it's been a good morning so far.

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,540
 Isaiah turned three.

26
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,940
 Yes, so we're very tired but very glad

27
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,680
 to be here this morning.

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,360
 But it has, it's been a great honor to journey with you

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,580
 through this summer over this sermon series and I hope

30
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,660
 that it has led to you having better conversations

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,240
 with the people around you,

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,160
 especially conversations about Jesus.

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,420
 The hope is that you've been reminded and inspired to know

34
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,360
 that a good conversation can be life-giving,

35
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,040
 can even be life-changing,

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,920
 especially if it's centered upon who Jesus is.

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,400
 And so, we hope that this is an ongoing thing

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,840
 that you'll take with you as you go about.

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,780
 But this series, you know, we have, like Carla says,

40
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,740
 it's been called Blowing Water as a play on the idea

41
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,060
 of having conversations and, you know,

42
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,760
 with chit-chatting with the people around you.

43
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,560
 But actually, the term chozo, right,

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,140
 to blow water can actually also mean something else.

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,240
 Right, because it can actually also mean to sort

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,280
 of tell a little bit of a lie, right,

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,840
 to exaggerate the story a little bit, to embellish the truth.

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,600
 Now, that's a weird word though, truth.

49
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,160
 It's such a problematic word, right.

50
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,200
 What is truth?

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,680
 How would you define truth?

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,280
 Right, this is an answer that, this is a question

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,720
 that people have been attempting to answer for many,

54
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,480
 many years in many, many different ways.

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,920
 Right, so one area where you might be able to find truth is

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,280
 in the area of mathematics, right.

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,560
 Okay, don't switch off, okay.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,940
 One plus one equals two.

59
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,860
 Simple mathematic, we've all learned this in school.

60
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,080
 Simple arithmetic, even a toddler can figure

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
 out one plus one is two.

62
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,080
 Now, you see on the screen, you know it, but is it really true?

63
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,360
 Does one plus one always equal two?

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,960
 Are there times when one plus one does not equal two?

65
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,960
 So, for example, let's say I had one glass of water,

66
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,880
 I had another glass of water, so two cups of water,

67
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,260
 but if I poured them into one cup,

68
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,380
 then one plus one doesn't equal two.

69
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,920
 One plus one somehow became one again.

70
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,920
 All right, so maybe math doesn't always give us the truth.

71
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,240
 How about logical statements, right.

72
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,860
 Those of you who studied a bit of logic at university

73
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,540
 or in high school, something like that, right.

74
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,520
 One of the things that people say is that statements

75
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,840
 that are true should lead to a true conclusion.

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,780
 For example, some Hong Kongers are women.

77
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,440
 Andy Lau is a Hong Konger.

78
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,460
 Therefore, Lau is a woman, right.

79
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,620
 Now, I don't think that's not true either.

80
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,080
 Side note, by the way, I have a very interesting encounter

81
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,700
 with Andy Lau, if you guys ever want to hear about that,

82
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,820
 take me out for coffee, I'll tell you all about it.

83
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,320
 Very interesting, okay.

84
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,180
 But, okay, you can see it's actually, you know,

85
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,900
 it just creates more confusion.

86
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,260
 Okay, if we just put theory aside, you know,

87
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,780
 all these are just theories and mathematics, you know,

88
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,060
 you guys just started school,

89
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,660
 you don't want to talk about that yet.

90
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,920
 What about things that really have an impact on our life?

91
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,340
 Like, for example, for me growing up,

92
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,300
 there were a few things, three things my grandma

93
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,140
 and my mom always drilled into my mind,

94
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,180
 and they swore they were true, okay.

95
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,520
 You might be able to relate, okay.

96
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,580
 They told me these three things. Number one,

97
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,780
 if you sleep with a fan blowing in your face,

98
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,520
 you will suffocate and you will die, okay.

99
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,220
 So, don't turn the fan on when you're sleeping, okay,

100
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,160
 all the time.

101
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,020
 Number two, every piece of rice that you left uneaten will

102
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,260
 become a scar on your future spouse's face, right,

103
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,780
 which 好豆皮婆, right.

104
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,460
 So, if you don't finish your rice,

105
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,100
 you're going to have an ugly wife, okay.

106
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,460
 That was the other thing, okay.

107
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,160
 Thirdly, don't drink cold water.

108
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,280
 Even if it's super hot outside, do not drink cold water.

109
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,160
 Cold water is like the worst thing for you.

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,440
 If you drink cold water, oh, Caleb's agreeing, okay.

111
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,040
 If you drink cold water, you will die, okay.

112
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,480
 So, like, all these things to try and control,

113
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,600
 to try and, you know, tell me.

114
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,720
 Needless to say, my childhood was spent very full,

115
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,520
 but very hot and very thirsty all the time, okay.

116
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,360
 So, here's the truth, right.

117
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,700
 Because it's such an elusive thing,

118
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,020
 that we want to try and grab it,

119
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,780
 we want to try and understand it,

120
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,220
 but we can't use our logic, we can't trust mathematics,

121
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,460
 we can't even trust the people who love us.

122
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,340
 So, what is, how do we get to know the truth?

123
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,620
 And as we come to the end of the series today,

124
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,820
 I want us to be sure, I want us to know that the conversations

125
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,860
 that we've looked at through the past few weeks have been

126
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,140
 more than just casual conversations.

127
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,420
 It's more than just choice.

128
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,940
 So, it's definitely hasn't been lying or exaggeration

129
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,100
 or embellishing, because each and every word

130
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,740
 that we've looked at has been the truth.

131
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,820
 Because they're conversations surrounding who Jesus is.

132
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,580
 And if the truth is what we're after,

133
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,420
 then we'll only find our answer

134
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,740
 when we turn our attention to Him.

135
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,780
 So, let's turn our attention to Scripture

136
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,980
 and see what we can discover.

137
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,420
 John chapter 20, 2018, I can't remember the chapter.

138
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,060
 Anyway, you can follow along on the screen, okay?

139
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,580
 Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas

140
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,260
 to the place of the Roman governor.

141
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,380
 By now, it was early morning,

142
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,020
 and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness,

143
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,780
 they did not enter the palace,

144
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,220
 because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.

145
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,100
 So, Pilate came out and asked them,

146
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,780
 "What charges do you bring against this man?"

147
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,260
 "If we were not a criminal," they replied,

148
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,540
 "we would not have brought him over to you."

149
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,780
 Pilate said, "Take him yourselves

150
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,460
 "and judge him by your own law."

151
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,260
 "But we have no right to execute anyone," they objected.

152
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,020
 This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said

153
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,220
 about the kind of death he was going to die.

154
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,500
 Pilate then went back inside the palace,

155
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,140
 summoned Jesus, and asked Him,

156
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,100
 "Are you the King of the Jews?"

157
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,820
 "Is this your own idea?" Jesus asked.

158
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,180
 "Or did others talk to you about me?"

159
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,380
 "Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied.

160
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,740
 "Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me.

161
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,420
 "What is it that you have done?"

162
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,100
 Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world.

163
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,300
 "If it were, my servants would fight

164
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,660
 "to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders.

165
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,100
 "But my kingdom is from another place."

166
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,660
 "You are a king, then," said Pilate.

167
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,860
 Jesus replied, "You say that I am king?

168
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,700
 "In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world

169
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,420
 "is to testify to the truth.

170
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,020
 "Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."

171
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,940
 "What is truth?" retorted Pilate.

172
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,060
 And with this, he went out again.

173
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,660
 Now, before we get into the details,

174
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,740
 let's just get a bit of background foundation

175
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,980
 and context to what the passage is talking about this morning.

176
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,100
 This passage happens in the middle

177
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,500
 of what is sometimes known as the Passion of Jesus.

178
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,900
 Right, he is in his last hours before going to the cross.

179
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,580
 And in these last hours, a lot has happened.

180
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,940
 Jesus has spent some deeply personal

181
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,020
 and intimate time with his disciples.

182
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,980
 He's washed their feet.

183
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,340
 He's had their last supper with them.

184
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,780
 He's prayed prayers of comfort over them

185
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,700
 and explained to them what's about to happen,

186
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,460
 that he is about to die.

187
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,780
 But he's also explained to them the dangers

188
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,380
 that lie ahead for them, the hatred,

189
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,180
 the risk they would face as followers in the days to come.

190
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,660
 He's been betrayed by one of his own disciples,

191
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,740
 arrested by a group of soldiers,

192
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,980
 abandoned then by the rest of them,

193
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,500
 and Peter, one of his closest friends,

194
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,060
 has just denied him three times.

195
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,660
 He's then been mocked, slapped, and judged by the high priest.

196
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,740
 It's been a really difficult couple of hours.

197
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,140
 And this is where the story picks back up.

198
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,260
 And the Jewish leaders took him from the high priest,

199
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,380
 that's Caiaphas, to the place of the Roman governor.

200
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,540
 By now, it was early morning,

201
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,940
 and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness,

202
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,540
 they did not enter the palace

203
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,260
 because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.

204
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,260
 So one thing we've seen throughout this series

205
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,100
 is consistently the tension

206
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,780
 between the religious leaders and Jesus.

207
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,140
 Right, they're always trying to get him.

208
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,340
 They're always out to attack him.

209
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,620
 From the moment Jesus starts his ministry,

210
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,020
 many of the religious leaders are determined

211
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,780
 to do whatever they can to put a stop to him,

212
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,260
 right, to have him arrested, to ultimately kill him,

213
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,820
 stop this movement, you know, stop his followers,

214
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,420
 and just be rid of Jesus once and for all.

215
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,500
 And in this moment, it seems like

216
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,660
 they're finally about to be successful.

217
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,900
 If there was a newspaper around at the time,

218
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,860
 the headline would have probably read something like,

219
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,460
 "Trouble-making false teacher finally apprehended."

220
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,980
 Right, this was going to be their big moment.

221
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,340
 By the way, sidestep,

222
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,660
 the slides for this series have been amazing.

223
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,340
 I mean, Anshan has been our designer,

224
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,020
 and I've just really appreciated the creativity

225
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,060
 she's put behind the slides.

226
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,180
 So Anshan, if you're out there, if you're listening,

227
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,980
 thank you for your creativity

228
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,940
 to help bring these messages alive.

229
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,820
 But this would have been the title, right?

230
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,500
 They finally find Jesus where they want him.

231
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,580
 And Jesus finds himself under custody,

232
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,140
 face-to-face with a Roman governor.

233
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,340
 Pilate, this was the man

234
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,180
 who had the authority to decide his fate.

235
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,500
 And so from the perspective of the religious leaders,

236
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,940
 this was perfect.

237
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,020
 They have Jesus exactly where they want him.

238
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,860
 Finally, he's going to get what he deserves.

239
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,700
 Right, after all, this was the guy

240
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,820
 who flipped tables in the temple.

241
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,260
 This was the guy who was constantly breaking Sabbath rules.

242
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,180
 This was the guy who hung out with sinners and prostitutes,

243
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,860
 tax collectors, adulterers, Gentiles,

244
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,300
 all those kind of unclean people.

245
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,940
 And worst of all, this was the man who lied

246
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,340
 because he claimed to be one with God.

247
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,260
 They said he was out of his mind.

248
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,140
 They said he was the prince of demons.

249
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,900
 But this was far from the truth

250
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,660
 because the truth was that throughout his whole life,

251
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,020
 throughout his whole ministry, Jesus never sinned.

252
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,580
 The truth was that these religious leaders

253
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,100
 were the ones who were unable to see the truth

254
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,100
 because they were so bound up and blinded

255
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,580
 by their own judgmental and hypocritical hearts.

256
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,780
 You see, there's something really ironic happening here

257
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,420
 that John wants us to notice.

258
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,580
 He tells us that the religious leaders

259
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,740
 wanted to avoid ceremonial uncleanness.

260
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,820
 So that's why they didn't enter the palace

261
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,700
 because entering into a Gentile's home,

262
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,540
 which the Pilate was, would have made them unclean.

263
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,340
 And because of that, they wouldn't have been able

264
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,380
 to eat the Passover.

265
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,540
 So they didn't go in to meet with Pilate

266
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,540
 because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.

267
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,700
 But do you see what's happening?

268
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,220
 Right, this Passover was one of the biggest celebrations

269
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,700
 in the Jewish calendar.

270
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,180
 Right, this is where the Israelites commemorate

271
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,420
 and celebrate God bringing them out of exodus,

272
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,460
 right, bringing them out of slavery into freedom.

273
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,100
 And one of the key elements in the Passover in Egypt

274
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,580
 was when God asked them to sacrifice a lamb

275
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,100
 so that they would be kept safe

276
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,540
 and the angel of death would pass over the homes

277
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,060
 that had the mark of the blood of the lamb.

278
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,100
 And since then, after every Passover,

279
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,780
 lambs were slaughtered and sacrificed

280
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,060
 in memory of what God had done for his people.

281
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,020
 So it's interesting, right?

282
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,260
 They wanted to be ceremonially clean,

283
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,660
 but at the same time in their hearts,

284
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,660
 they were planning to execute an innocent man.

285
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,620
 Right, in other words,

286
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,420
 they just wanted to look clean on the outside.

287
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,740
 Inside though, they were planning for evil.

288
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,100
 They were willing to lie,

289
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,540
 to throw out false accusations, to condemn,

290
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,140
 but at the same time claiming to want to worship God.

291
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,100
 Right, they were doing exactly what Jesus saw in them

292
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,140
 in the first place.

293
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,260
 Matthew 23, "Hypocrites, you are like whitewashed tombs,

294
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,340
 "which look beautiful on the outside,

295
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,860
 "but on the inside, full of the bones of the dead

296
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,300
 "and everything unclean.

297
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,340
 "In the same way, on the outside,

298
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,300
 "you appear to people as righteous,

299
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,860
 "but inside, you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness."

300
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,500
 And here's the irony.

301
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,060
 As the lambs were being prepared

302
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,940
 to be sacrificed in the temple for the Passover,

303
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,180
 they couldn't see that standing before them

304
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,420
 was the ultimate sacrifice,

305
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,900
 the most purest and innocent lamb without sin.

306
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,140
 And this time, his sacrifice wasn't just

307
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,820
 gonna be leading the Israelites out of Egypt,

308
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,780
 but it was to lead the entire world

309
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,900
 out of sin and into freedom.

310
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,180
 But they weren't able to see it.

311
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,500
 See, hypocrisy is when we believe

312
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,780
 or claim to believe in the truth, but we live out a lie.

313
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,820
 And this is something we all need to be careful of

314
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,260
 because it's a trap that any one of us

315
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,220
 can very easily fall into.

316
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,860
 Right, we want to come to church,

317
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,660
 we want to worship God, enjoy Christian fellowship,

318
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,420
 serve in the community, and all these things

319
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,100
 are good and great, but as we do these things, church,

320
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,060
 we have to ask ourselves,

321
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,100
 are our hearts in the right place?

322
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,020
 Because it's really, really easy

323
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,020
 to look good on the outside.

324
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,220
 Now, hopefully, most of us in this room

325
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,940
 aren't conspiring for murder

326
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,980
 and put innocent people to death, right?

327
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,700
 We're not going to that extreme.

328
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,100
 But this doesn't mean it's something that we can ignore.

329
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,540
 Because I think in our context,

330
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,420
 it works itself out in our everyday lives.

331
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,700
 And if we're not careful, I think we can very easily

332
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,940
 begin to live what I call a sort of like a double life, right?

333
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,980
 Doing whatever we want during the week,

334
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,340
 getting a spiritual high on Sunday,

335
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,580
 feeling a little bit of remorse,

336
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,780
 only to forget about it all again on Monday.

337
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,140
 Rinse, repeat.

338
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,220
 I know this 'cause my own experience was like this.

339
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,660
 For many years of my life, I really felt as though

340
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,580
 I was living two separate identities, right?

341
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,980
 And church on Sunday, around my church friends,

342
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,860
 everyone thought I was doing great, right?

343
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,020
 I grew up in the church.

344
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,540
 My third language is Christianese, okay?

345
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,860
 So anytime someone asks you,

346
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,700
 I knew exactly what to say.

347
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,540
 Oh, how you doing?

348
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,340
 Oh, yes, you know, really plugged in to my small group.

349
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,980
 I really got good at doing my QTs

350
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,020
 and all this kind of stuff, all those language.

351
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,900
 I knew what people wanted to hear

352
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,100
 and I was able to pretend really, really well.

353
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,700
 But I know in my heart, on the inside,

354
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,060
 and how I live my life, it was far from God.

355
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,660
 And it was probably some of the most confusing

356
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,260
 and tiring seasons of my life.

357
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,700
 And I thought I could keep it up,

358
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
 but in truth, I was living a lie.

359
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,060
 Because the truth is,

360
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,620
 the truth is what Jesus is seeking

361
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,740
 is for people to worship him in spirit and in truth.

362
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,540
 And what Jesus is looking for

363
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,660
 is people who are willing to take a good look

364
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,660
 and do something about the log that is in their own eye.

365
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,700
 What Jesus is looking for

366
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,580
 is people who are willing to cut off their hand

367
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,180
 if that's what it takes for them to stop sinning.

368
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,700
 Not that we have to be perfect, right?

369
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,620
 It's not calling for that,

370
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,100
 but the only way scripture tells us

371
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,100
 that we can seek and find God

372
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,340
 is when we do so with all our heart.

373
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,500
 So for some of us here,

374
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,380
 before we have a conversation with anyone else,

375
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,780
 maybe the first conversation you have to have today

376
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,300
 is with yourself.

377
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,020
 Are you claiming to love Jesus

378
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,700
 with your words and appearance,

379
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,220
 but in reality, your heart is far from him?

380
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,220
 If this is you this morning, keep listening,

381
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,020
 because maybe this is a wake-up call,

382
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,300
 a reminder to find out what it means

383
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,380
 to truly follow Jesus.

384
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,540
 So let's go back to the passage and see what it has to say.

385
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,100
 So Pilate came out and asked them,

386
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,260
 "What charges are you bringing against this man?

387
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,300
 "If we were not a criminal," they said,

388
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,940
 "we would not have handed him over to you."

389
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,060
 And Pilate said then,

390
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,080
 "But take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.

391
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,860
 "But we have no right to execute anyone," they objected.

392
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,900
 This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said

393
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,080
 about the kind of death he was going to die.

394
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,680
 Right, so since they're being stubborn

395
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,220
 and they won't go in, Pilate has to come out.

396
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,480
 Now, Pilate, who was Pilate?

397
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,740
 Pilate was the governor of this area at the time,

398
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,460
 but he had a reputation for being a brute and a bully.

399
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,260
 He had a reputation for being a man

400
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,540
 who wasn't afraid to use violence

401
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,620
 in order to bring order back into his jurisdiction.

402
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,860
 And he was the one with the authority to execute someone.

403
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,980
 It was the perfect opportunity.

404
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,480
 But what exactly has Jesus done wrong?

405
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,980
 Pilate wants to know.

406
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,580
 Right, what charges are you bringing against this man?

407
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,460
 Right, there's a legal procedure that needs to happen here

408
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,100
 before we sentence him to death.

409
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,100
 And like we said, right, these people,

410
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,420
 the religious leaders believe Jesus as a blasphemer,

411
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,180
 one who dared to put himself with equal footing with God,

412
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,700
 breaker of rules, a false teacher, son of the devil,

413
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,420
 all that kind of stuff.

414
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,660
 But Pilate doesn't care about these things, right?

415
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,180
 As far as he, in his mind,

416
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,860
 those things are just internal Jewish squabbles.

417
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,040
 You just squash that yourself.

418
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,180
 Don't bring me into this.

419
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,540
 But they're insistent, and they say,

420
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,480
 "If he were not a criminal," they replied,

421
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,260
 "we would not have handed him over to you."

422
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,180
 So this is one of those classic answers

423
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,560
 that tries to answer the question

424
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
 without really answering the question.

425
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,060
 You know, it's like when you ask,

426
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,540
 when I ask my wife, "Hey, how much did that dress cost?"

427
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,360
 And she says something like, "Well, it was on sale."

428
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,840
 Right?

429
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,820
 Okay, that doesn't really tell me anything, okay?

430
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,260
 It's sort of what's happening here, right?

431
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,660
 They're trying to convince Pilate,

432
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,500
 hey, if we can convince Pilate

433
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,300
 that this guy really is a rebel rouser, right,

434
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,620
 this guy's a subvert of the Roman Empire, right,

435
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,540
 he's gonna threaten your rule,

436
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,380
 he's gonna bring instability to the province,

437
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,020
 then maybe we can get him to sign off with our evil plans.

438
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,100
 Right, so this was the way they thought

439
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,060
 they were gonna convince Pilate,

440
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,420
 only they have no real evidence,

441
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,160
 so they just throw out something really general,

442
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,660
 like, oh yeah, this guy is a criminal.

443
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:13,020
 Again, something very ironic is happening here.

444
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,880
 See, ultimately, what the Pharisees

445
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,520
 are trying to convince Pilate of

446
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,080
 is that Jesus is treasonous, he's committing treason,

447
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,840
 he's going against Caesar himself,

448
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,120
 and he's gonna be a threat to this governor.

449
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,060
 But as they were accusing Jesus of treason,

450
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,360
 they were also committing treason.

451
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,280
 Only it wasn't the earthly government

452
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,180
 that they were going against,

453
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,920
 but it was a going against God himself.

454
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,120
 But they're blind, they can't see it.

455
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,540
 But there's also one other thing they're blind to.

456
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,100
 You see, this whole time,

457
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,100
 religious leaders at the time think they're being sly.

458
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,140
 They think they're being clever,

459
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,180
 they think that, you know, this is the perfect plan,

460
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,520
 they're carrying out.

461
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,400
 But the truth is this.

462
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,760
 The reality is that this, all this that's happening,

463
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,240
 took place to fulfill what Jesus had said

464
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,360
 about the kind of death he was going to die.

465
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,480
 So, on the surface, it looks like Jesus is under arrest.

466
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,440
 On the surface, it looks like his fate has been sealed,

467
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,400
 he's been stripped of his power.

468
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,080
 On the surface, it looks as though Jesus is done for.

469
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,160
 But the truth is, everyone involved in this story

470
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,840
 are just players living out,

471
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,760
 acting what God has already said.

472
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,160
 They just don't realize it.

473
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,820
 And the truth is, despite of what things look like,

474
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,680
 Jesus is in full control of the situation.

475
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,960
 In fact, Jesus could have put a stop to this at any moment.

476
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,640
 In Matthew, he says, in Matthew 26, he says,

477
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,960
 "Don't you think that I can't call on my Father

478
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,920
 "and at once, at my disposal,

479
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,680
 "more than 12 legions of angels would come to my side?

480
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,920
 "But then how would Scripture be fulfilled

481
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,920
 "to say that it must happen this way?"

482
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:18,120
 In talking about death, also, Jesus had once said,

483
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,560
 just that Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness,

484
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,360
 so the Son of Man must be lifted up.

485
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,880
 This is what Jesus was talking about,

486
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,560
 that it had to happen in this way.

487
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,160
 Now, to understand this, we need to, again,

488
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,840
 go back to the Exodus.

489
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,000
 In the Exodus, after the Israelites left Egypt

490
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,760
 and they were wandering out in the desert,

491
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,520
 the Israelites were constantly failing

492
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,140
 into the habit of complaining against God,

493
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,080
 complaining against Moses, turning to idols,

494
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,160
 saying things like, "Oh, it was so much better

495
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,180
 "when we were back in Egypt.

496
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,440
 "Why did you lead us out here to die in the wilderness?"

497
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,960
 And as a result, every now and then,

498
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,960
 God would have to send punishment to remind them

499
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,680
 of their wrongdoing in turning to idols

500
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,640
 and complaining against Him.

501
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,360
 And one of the punishments that God sent

502
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,960
 was quite weird and quite unique.

503
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,320
 He sent poisonous snakes into the camp,

504
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,960
 and people started getting bitten by these poisonous snakes

505
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,100
 and they would die.

506
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,160
 And as this was happening,

507
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,280
 the Israelites would realize their sin,

508
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,600
 and once again, they called on God for help.

509
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,760
 And in order to save them, God told Moses to do this.

510
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,480
 He told Moses, "Make a snake and put it up on a pole.

511
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,880
 "Anyone who is bitten can look at it and live."

512
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,320
 So then Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole.

513
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,960
 Then when anyone was bitten by a snake

514
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,800
 and looked at the bronze snake, they lived.

515
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,160
 Jesus is living out this prophecy here

516
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,600
 because in the same way, Jesus knows that in a little while,

517
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,200
 like the bronze snake was gonna be hoisted up,

518
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,040
 he too was gonna be hoisted up.

519
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,520
 Only it wasn't on a bronze pole.

520
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,120
 Jesus was gonna be hoisted up on the cross.

521
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,440
 And just as the Israelites received life

522
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,720
 when they looked at the bronze snake in the desert,

523
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,520
 anyone who would look up toward Jesus on the cross

524
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,400
 and have faith in His healing would too receive life.

525
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,600
 All this to say, none of this was happening by accident.

526
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,320
 Pastor Promise talked about this last week,

527
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,680
 but I want it to really be dwelling in our minds, Church.

528
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,960
 Remember this well.

529
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,960
 The truth is that Jesus is always in control.

530
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,600
 Jesus is always in control.

531
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,100
 Even as these men worked together

532
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,880
 to plot injustice and evil,

533
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
 God was gonna work all of this

534
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,280
 to bring about the destruction of sin and darkness.

535
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,880
 Even what people planned for evil,

536
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,100
 God was gonna use it for good.

537
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,240
 Excuse me, this is why Jesus is so confident

538
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,880
 as He continues to be grilled and to be questioned.

539
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
 He never wavers.

540
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,640
 Pilate goes back inside the palace.

541
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,920
 He summons Jesus and asks Him,

542
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,280
 "Are you the King of the Jews?

543
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,760
 "Is this your own idea?" asked Jesus.

544
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,460
 "Or did others tell you about me?"

545
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,640
 "I'm not a Jew," Pilate replied.

546
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,780
 "Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me.

547
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,480
 "What is it that you have done?"

548
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,900
 You know, when I read the Bible,

549
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,680
 sometimes I like to insert myself into the stories.

550
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,440
 In this section of Scripture, I always wonder,

551
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,500
 what was Pilate thinking as he looked at Jesus?

552
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,800
 'Cause as he sees this man standing before him, right,

553
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,000
 Jesus at this point probably looking kind of feeble,

554
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,640
 kind of weak, a man whose followers

555
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,280
 have left Him high and dry.

556
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,000
 What possible, in what possible realm of imagination

557
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,300
 could this guy be a king?

558
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,060
 So what Pilate's really asking is this, right?

559
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,780
 Who are you?

560
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,940
 Who are you?

561
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,540
 People say you're this, people say you're that.

562
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,360
 Who are you?

563
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,340
 Are you here to make trouble for me?

564
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,940
 Are you really gonna be a threat to my power?

565
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,780
 Who are you?

566
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,980
 Who is this man that's standing in front of me?

567
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,240
 And in true fashion, Jesus answers his question

568
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,940
 with another question.

569
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,500
 "Is this your own idea?" Jesus says.

570
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,740
 "Or did others tell you to talk about me?"

571
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,860
 You see, Jesus answers this way

572
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,900
 because I think he knows Pilate's heart.

573
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,900
 In other words, as Pilate is asking Jesus, "Who are you?"

574
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,940
 Jesus is asking Pilate, "Do you really want to know?"

575
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,100
 Like, is that question really coming from your heart?

576
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,200
 Do you really want to know who I am?

577
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,300
 Because if you do, if Pilate is genuinely interested,

578
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,120
 like the woman at the well,

579
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,740
 like the woman caught in adultery,

580
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,300
 like the Canaanite woman,

581
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,300
 Jesus was ready to tell him who exactly he was.

582
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,660
 And Pilate is being offered the same opportunity here.

583
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,920
 But let me also turn this question to us this morning.

584
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,500
 Maybe it's a question we have to ask ourselves.

585
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,540
 Do you know who Jesus is?

586
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,460
 Have you really asked that question?

587
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,560
 Jesus, who are you?

588
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,240
 And in your thinking about Jesus,

589
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,160
 maybe you see Jesus as a threat to your lifestyle.

590
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,660
 Maybe it seems like Jesus is here

591
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,000
 to dictate how you live your life, right?

592
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,300
 To derail your plans, to threaten the authority you have

593
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,880
 over your own life right now.

594
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,520
 And I know this is a stumbling block for many,

595
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,700
 to fully give the life to Jesus,

596
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,100
 because maybe you're in a good place.

597
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,320
 Things are going well,

598
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,000
 and to invite Jesus into the equation

599
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,800
 seems like it's gonna be a threat to how you live your life.

600
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,960
 But I'm gonna ask you again,

601
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,560
 because how you answer this question

602
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,200
 will 100% have an effect on how your life turns out,

603
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,280
 how you live your life.

604
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,440
 Do you really want to know who Jesus is?

605
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,200
 Or are you seeking Jesus for some other reason?

606
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,440
 Maybe your parents force you to.

607
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,720
 Maybe your spouse drags you to church every week

608
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,680
 and say, "Come on, let's just go."

609
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,940
 Okay, fine, I'll go.

610
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,680
 Maybe there's someone you're interested in

611
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,320
 that's a Christian, and you're here just to,

612
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,220
 you know, trying to get to know them a little bit better.

613
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,760
 Maybe you come to church 'cause you like the music,

614
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,000
 and we have a good kids program.

615
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,080
 There could be a whole bunch of reasons

616
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,880
 why we come in the name to church and to seek Jesus.

617
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,760
 And we love you, God loves you,

618
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,280
 and we're so glad you're here.

619
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,360
 But you're being challenged here today

620
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,640
 to check your hearts and motives,

621
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,240
 and be honest before God.

622
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,440
 And if you've never seriously asked yourself this question,

623
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,360
 or you're in a place where you need a good reminder,

624
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,880
 then perhaps today is the day you open up yourself to Him.

625
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,640
 Let me ask us again.

626
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,640
 Do you really want to know who Jesus is?

627
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,360
 Well, let me try and help us out a little bit.

628
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,640
 Because knowing the truth to this question,

629
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,120
 like I said, is not only gonna change your life,

630
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,080
 it's gonna have the most amazing impact on your life,

631
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,520
 now and forevermore.

632
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,600
 Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world.

633
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,540
 "If it were, my servants would fight

634
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,060
 "to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders.

635
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,160
 "But now my kingdom is from another place."

636
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,480
 Ah, you are a king then, said Pilate.

637
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,840
 Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king.

638
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,200
 "In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world

639
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,580
 "is to testify to the truth.

640
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,160
 "Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."

641
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,600
 Jesus finally tells Pilate plainly who He is.

642
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,480
 Yes, I am a king.

643
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,720
 I am a king.

644
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,960
 Jesus has a kingdom, but His kingdom

645
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,440
 isn't like the sort of kingdom that He has in mind.

646
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,400
 Jesus' kingdom is not like the kingdoms of this world.

647
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,200
 His kingdom isn't one that's been secured by war,

648
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,040
 violence, political maneuvering, like earthly kingdoms are.

649
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,840
 See, in that time, this is how kingdoms were won, right?

650
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,160
 Through violence, through power, through control,

651
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,240
 through defeating the enemy with your army.

652
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
 But Jesus has always been adamant

653
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,740
 that this is not what I'm about.

654
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,380
 Not that He's not capable to fight.

655
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,440
 We said just now He was very capable of that.

656
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,480
 He could dominate easily in that way if He wanted to,

657
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,880
 but the kingship and kingdom of Jesus

658
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,140
 was gonna be like nothing this world has ever seen.

659
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,040
 So how does this play in our context?

660
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,720
 We don't really live in land ruled by kings and queens,

661
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,440
 but other things do rule our lives and our culture,

662
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,880
 and other forces attempt to exert

663
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,580
 similar control over our lives.

664
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,000
 So what do our kingdoms look like?

665
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,760
 Our kingdoms are ruled by our own comfort,

666
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,460
 love of money and power and popularity.

667
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,940
 Our kingdoms are dictated by our own selfish desires.

668
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,760
 Our kingdoms appeal to our senses and say it's okay

669
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,960
 to follow the lust of your eyes, the desires of your flesh.

670
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,800
 Our kingdoms tell us you only live once,

671
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,960
 so just go and do whatever you want to do.

672
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,000
 Our kingdoms tell us that there are many ways

673
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,360
 to know the truth, that you are the captain of your destiny.

674
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,500
 But Jesus says my kingdom is from a different place.

675
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,040
 My kingdom functions differently

676
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,600
 because it's not of this world, it's for this world.

677
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,520
 And my kingdom is here to show you

678
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,820
 that we don't have to be enslaved

679
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,400
 by these things that we just talked about.

680
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,640
 Jesus says my kingdom is the kingdom of truth.

681
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,600
 And because I am king,

682
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,240
 and because my kingdom is represented by truth,

683
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,400
 if you want to know the truth, listen to me.

684
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,640
 "What is truth?" retorted Pilate.

685
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,440
 With this, he went out.

686
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,320
 Unfortunately, it was only a half-hearted rhetorical question

687
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,000
 and every time I get to this part in passage,

688
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,880
 what is truth, I can't help but to feel

689
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,080
 like a twinge of sorrow for Pilate

690
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,600
 because here he is face to face with Jesus

691
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,520
 with every opportunity to find out the definition

692
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,680
 of what truth was and yet he fails to figure it out.

693
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,920
 He fails to feel it.

694
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,480
 He fails to experience it.

695
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,080
 He fails to understand it.

696
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,320
 He fails to believe in it and he walks away.

697
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,720
 But like I said, today might be the day for you.

698
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,280
 And if today you found yourself asking that question,

699
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,280
 if God's speaking to your heart, do not walk away

700
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,740
 because here's the truth.

701
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,640
 The truth is this.

702
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,920
 The truth is that you were not made for this kingdom,

703
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,480
 the kingdom of this world,

704
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,760
 but you were created for the kingdom of Jesus.

705
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,400
 The truth is that Jesus loves you.

706
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,320
 He doesn't condemn you for the things

707
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,400
 that you yourself are not proud of.

708
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,920
 And the truth is Jesus wants to change your life

709
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,000
 for the better.

710
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,040
 He wants to give you a testimony

711
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,040
 so that you can proclaim what he has done to other people.

712
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,440
 The truth is that everyone, everyone is welcome

713
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,600
 in the family of God and God will never discriminate

714
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,480
 against you no matter who you are.

715
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,920
 The truth is that God is with you.

716
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,600
 Even as you have to go and fight through the most horrible

717
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,840
 and darkest of times, God is with you.

718
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,040
 And the truth is God is also with us

719
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,240
 as we struggle through trials and temptations.

720
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,780
 God is there to lead us and to guide us.

721
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,040
 The truth is that God is with you through it all

722
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,920
 and that he works all things for your good.

723
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,480
 And the truth is that Jesus came into this world

724
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,200
 because he loves you to die for your sins,

725
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,320
 to bear the punishment that we couldn't bear

726
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,160
 so we too can have a place in Jesus' kingdom.

727
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,480
 The truth is church, there's only one way to live

728
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,040
 that will leave you truly fulfilled.

729
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,740
 And that's through listening, obeying, and loving Jesus.

730
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,680
 You see, when we come into a relationship with Jesus,

731
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,480
 you'll find the truth is not some sort

732
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,920
 of far-fetched philosophical concept.

733
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,360
 It's not religious stories made up to scare you

734
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,040
 to behave better.

735
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,840
 It's not the strongest opinion or the loudest voice.

736
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,140
 It's not a method or a scientific formula.

737
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,140
 The truth is Jesus is the way, the truth, and life.

738
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:46,120
 And salvation and freedom are found in him and him alone.

739
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,780
 There's a very precious gift that we have here, church.

740
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,920
 If you know Jesus, you hold the truth within you.

741
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,040
 And this is the truth that everyone is looking for.

742
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,920
 Everyone needs to hear this.

743
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,160
 And since we have it, we've been told to share it,

744
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,280
 to declare it, for conversations of truth

745
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,040
 is what this world truly needs.

746
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,460
 So I pray if you know Jesus and you love Jesus

747
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,920
 and you're following the truth,

748
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,360
 continue to blow water in his name

749
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,980
 and let more people know about who he is.

750
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,000
 But perhaps you're in this room today

751
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,920
 and his truth is something you once held near.

752
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,120
 But for whatever reasons, you've lost sight of it.

753
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,380
 And you started going on your own path.

754
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,360
 And somewhere along the way, you've got a bit lost

755
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,620
 and it's hard for you to know what the truth is anymore.

756
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,080
 Today might be the time for you to find it again,

757
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,680
 to believe again, to come back to the path

758
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,880
 that Jesus has set before you, to talk to Jesus again

759
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,240
 and hear that familiar voice of love calling out your name.

760
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,980
 And maybe for some of us in this room,

761
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,380
 this is the first time you're hearing about this.

762
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,160
 And maybe God's been speaking to you.

763
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,240
 You felt something in your heart, in your mind,

764
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,200
 and you say, yes, actually, this is what

765
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,160
 I've been seeking for.

766
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,400
 This is what I've been longing for.

767
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,280
 This is what I've been needing in my whole life.

768
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,000
 I've never heard it like this

769
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,440
 or I've never understood it like this,

770
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,880
 but I've heard Jesus speak to me

771
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,440
 and your heart is changing, your mind is changing.

772
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,160
 I want you to know that that's not me speaking to you,

773
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,440
 that's Jesus.

774
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,760
 Because he wants you to know the truth.

775
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,960
 And he's been waiting, he's been ready,

776
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,320
 his love has been there for you all this time

777
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,160
 to bring you out of the darkness into the light,

778
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,160
 to truly show you what your life on this earth is about,

779
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,200
 to give meaning and purpose and hope to your life.

780
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,120
 So I wonder, Church, if we could just

781
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,720
 close our eyes for a second and just take a moment

782
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,500
 to think, where are you in this journey?

783
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,260
 You know, there's so many different things

784
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,660
 in this world that distract us

785
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,660
 and it is easy to stop putting our faith in other things.

786
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:36,500
 It is easy to go astray and follow another voice instead.

787
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,740
 And it is a long journey sometimes

788
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,980
 of just seeking and seeking and trying to find the truth

789
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,780
 and the meaning of why am I on this earth?

790
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,180
 And is there a God that really loves me?

791
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,760
 (gentle music)

792
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,320
 Why am I on this earth?

793
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,040
 And is there a God that really loves me?

794
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:12,680
 Wherever we are in this journey,

795
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:20,000
 the true destination for every person

796
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,660
 that's ever walked on this earth,

797
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,880
 what you were created for was a life-giving,

798
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,880
 life-changing relationship with Jesus.

799
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,160
 That's the only true way to live.

800
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:44,080
 And so, Father, wherever our hearts are,

801
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,280
 I pray that you would lead us towards you.

802
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,420
 (gentle music)

803
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,160
 And Jesus, I pray especially for those

804
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,280
 who are maybe making that decision for the first time today

805
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,200
 to lay everything else down,

806
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,680
 to lay down their own plans and things

807
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,440
 which they thought were right and they thought were true,

808
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,720
 that they would respond to your voice,

809
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,280
 they would listen to you and join the side of truth,

810
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,580
 join the side of life, join the side of light,

811
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,880
 join the side of love because that's where you are, Lord.

812
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,080
 So, Jesus, I thank you that you are for us

813
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,320
 and not against us.

814
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:39,240
 Help us to hear, to see, to follow the truth

815
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,100
 and that's you, Lord.

816
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,560
 In your name we pray, amen.

817
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,140
 (gentle music)
