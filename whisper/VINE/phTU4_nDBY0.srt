1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
 That song that Promised Never Have Just sung

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,920
 may not be familiar to you.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,000
 It's called Lift Every Voice and Sing.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,800
 Originally written by James Weldon Johnson,

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,800
 first performed publicly in 1901.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,200
 It's a hymn, a hymn of thanksgiving,

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,200
 a hymn of hope, a song that speaks of the weariness

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,600
 of slavery and the oppression of authority

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,040
 that longs for the moment when the people will know

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,840
 true and lasting freedom.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,720
 It's a hymn, yes, but it is also a protest song.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,360
 A song that screams out for the plight of those

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,720
 that have only known, as the song sings,

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,720
 the chastening rod and the dark days that are upon them.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,440
 A song that looks forward to a God who is able

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,440
 to deliver and redeem, restore and renew a broken people.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,880
 The song was originally written, like I say, in 1901,

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,480
 but it actually found its fame much later

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,520
 in the hands of artists of color

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,440
 through the years of history,

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,920
 as they took that song and began to apply it

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,840
 to their context.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,920
 It's become known, actually, as the Black National Anthem

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,920
 and has been sung over many, many times in our history.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,560
 A song where people are willing to say

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,680
 that what's happening right now is not right,

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,960
 it's not wrong, what's happening right now

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,880
 is the reality of the situation,

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,280
 and that reality is unjust, and that reality needs to change,

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,280
 and yet the change comes because a God comes.

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,560
 Are you with me, church?

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,760
 The change comes not because of some people

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,760
 taking up arms, the change comes because a God comes,

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,520
 because there is advent, the coming of God.

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,200
 You know, when times are hard, when times are tough,

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,080
 humanity has a way of holding on to hope,

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,080
 and that way is found so often in song and music.

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
 Throughout human history, song and music has been used

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,280
 to tell a story, to speak of the reality of the present

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,240
 and the longing of the future,

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,440
 to declare what is happening today,

42
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,800
 and the expectation of what could happen tomorrow.

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,640
 And so throughout our human history, protest song,

44
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,960
 song in the midst of struggle and trial has risen up

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,600
 and given humanity hope.

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,000
 We can think quite recently of the black gospel music

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,400
 that raised up from the plantations in the South

48
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,280
 as the people cried out from their slavery.

49
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,680
 We can think perhaps of the Jews

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,120
 in the concentration camps in Germany,

51
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,360
 using the Psalms as songs that would speak

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,300
 of the liberation they longed for.

53
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,880
 Or even more recently, we could think perhaps

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,640
 of the rattling sound of punk music

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,480
 as it rose out of Europe in rebellion

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,420
 to the industrial revolution that was gripping the place.

57
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,120
 These songs have a grittiness to them, a realness to them,

58
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,400
 a way of shaking the dust off of a weary people

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,040
 and giving them a sense of hope for their future,

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,880
 hope, if you will, for the oppressed.

61
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,840
 Protest songs so often are aimed at those who are in power,

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,440
 either warning them of the things that will come

63
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,000
 or asking, petitioning for them to change,

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,500
 aimed at them, those with power and authority,

65
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,640
 to make changes for those who feel under oppression.

66
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,600
 Much like, for example, this song

67
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,440
 from the 1960s revolution.

68
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,600
 (audience applauding)

69
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,600
 (audience cheering)

70
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,600
, they're like, oh, Bob Dylan, great.

71
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
 (audience laughing)

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:25,040
 They're like, oh, Bob Dylan, greatest ever songwriter.

73
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,200
 The young amongst us are like, that guy sounds creepy.

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,680
 Who is that?

75
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,600
 Are you with me?

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,520
 Dylan writes this incredible song

77
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,120
 and speaks boldly and straight up

78
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
 to those in power in his day,

79
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
 calling them to wake up and change

80
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,720
 or some change might be coming to them.

81
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
 Sometimes protest songs don't speak to power

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,080
 but speaks to cultural moments,

83
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,400
 things that are happening in society around it,

84
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,260
 maybe things that are ethically looked at as being wrong

85
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,120
 and beginning to call out for change.

86
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,520
 Much like this example, for example,

87
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,520
 written in the 1970s and directed at the Vietnam War.

105
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,000
 That's Edwin Starr being blunt as he can be

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,140
 but really, really, really funky.

107
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,840
 War, what is it good for?

108
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
 Absolutely nothing.

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,480
 Songs of process, songs that gather the heart of the people

110
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
 oftentimes can be aimed at power,

111
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,760
 oftentimes can be aimed at the cultural moments around us

112
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,200
 but more often than not,

113
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,520
 they are actually simply telling a story.

114
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,480
 Telling the story of a broken people,

115
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,760
 a story of an oppressed people

116
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,880
 wanting others to know of their plight

117
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,480
 but within that story, weaving a narrative out of it,

118
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,280
 of hope, of freedom, of better times to come,

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,920
 of things changing in the future

120
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,640
 that can change the situation of the present

121
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,200
 much like for example, this song,

122
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,400
 one of my favorite old time songs.

123
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,240

 ♪ Redemption song ♪

137
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,600
 - It's quite beautiful, isn't it?

138
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,800
 A song of a man speaking on behalf of his nation

139
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,360
 trapped in colonization and white slavery

140
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,040
 and wanting to be free, being honest with the journey

141
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,480
 that has brought them to the land that they are in

142
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,980
 and yet saying this, won't you help me sing?

143
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,000
 'Cause all we've ever really longed for is freedom.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,760
 Redemption songs, songs of redemption.

145
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,960
 Songs of a people crying out to be redeemed.

146
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,540
 Think about that for a sec.

147
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,000
 Songs for those that long to be set free.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,680
 As we enter Advent today,

149
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,300
 one of the things we have to be really honest about

150
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,800
 is I think so often we've gotten Christmas wrong.

151
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,680
 If you look at your Christmas cards,

152
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,960
 if you look at the nativity plays that take place,

153
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,200
 it's all about the happiness and the kumbayarness in this.

154
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,560
 Ah, isn't it wonderful?

155
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,320
 But we need to realize that the historical backdrop,

156
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
 the cultural and social and political situation

157
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,300
 of the first century, if you were a Jewish person,

158
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,440
 was dark and dangerous and difficult.

159
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,100
 That that very first Christmas was draped in the shroud,

160
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,460
 if you will, of oppression.

161
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,020
 A group of people who were living oppressed

162
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,420
 within their land, occupiers in their very land.

163
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,880
 People who were longing, crying out for change.

164
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,100
 The Jewish people in the first century

165
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,900
 were in this tension of how do we live

166
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,340
 alongside of the occupiers in our land?

167
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,420
 How do we get on with them?

168
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,020
 How do we make life work here?

169
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,260
 And yet, when will the Messiah come?

170
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,540
 When will God step in and act

171
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,120
 so that we could know true redemption,

172
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,620
 true freedom, and true hope?

173
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,860
 You see, the Jewish people for 400 years

174
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,540
 had been hanging on to songs of redemption,

175
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,500
 hanging on to words that were crying out

176
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,020
 about their situation, longing for God to come,

177
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,700
 and they knew that God would come to free them

178
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,980
 as if it was like the breaking of chains.

179
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,160
 The prophets in the Old Testament spoke

180
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,020
 that when the Messiah comes, he will break those chains.

181
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,780
 And so Daniel and Isaiah and many others

182
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,220
 begin to bring a voice to this reality.

183
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,000
 Have a look at some of these examples here before me

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,940
 on the screen here.

185
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,420
 "Son of man," they cry out.

186
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,260
 They're waiting for one that would come like a human

187
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,660
 to help liberate them from their slavery.

188
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,900
 He'll proclaim freedom for the captives.

189
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,220
 He's gonna bind up the brokenhearted,

190
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,140
 proclaim the year of God's favor,

191
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,660
 release from darkness the prisoners.

192
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,020
 Can you sense the imagery in the language?

193
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,420
 Oh, God will come one day and set us free

194
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,500
 from the things that we are enslaved to.

195
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,780
 And that very first Christmas, this is the backdrop,

196
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,180
 the need for God to act in very dark

197
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,840
 and very difficult times.

198
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,520
 So perhaps it shouldn't surprise us

199
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,020
 that in our Christmas story that we're presented to

200
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,540
 in the Gospel of Luke, that very first Christmas,

201
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,540
 the story is told predominantly through four songs.

202
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,940
 Songs that story tell the reality of the people

203
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,660
 and the longing that they have to be redeemed.

204
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,220
 So the four main characters that weave through that story,

205
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,140
 Mary, Zechariah, a host of angels,

206
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,520
 and Simeon, a man who was living in the temple at the time,

207
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,060
 these four main characters bring a song

208
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,420
 in that first Christmas.

209
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,420
 A song not unlike those of Dylan, of Star, and of Marley.

210
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:24,360
 A song that would say what happening right now is not right,

211
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,740
 but there is a God who can come and make it right.

212
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,300
 The advent, the longing for this God to come

213
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,080
 is captured in the beauty of these songs.

214
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,720
 Songs that don't accept what is happening right now

215
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,460
 as the reality that always needs to happen.

216
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,460
 Songs that root themselves in a idea of coming freedom.

217
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:51,960
 And so Mary sings a song that brings hope for the oppressed.

218
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,580
 Zechariah sings his song about rest for the weary.

219
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,060
 The angels proclaim a beautiful song of peace

220
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,660
 for the troubled.

221
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,560
 And then Simeon comes and speaks about the light

222
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,320
 that there can be for the lost amongst us.

223
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,360
 And in all four of these,

224
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,460
 you have songs from different people within Jewish society.

225
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,000
 You have songs from a different collection of people,

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,820
 songs with a different story and a background,

227
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,660
 but all embedded within the oppression that they're feeling.

228
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,440
 And these are songs for the not so holy,

229
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,680
 for the ones that feel like

230
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,120
 they haven't got it all together.

231
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,800
 Ones that are overwhelmed and fearful,

232
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,480
 ones that are in a place of uncertainty.

233
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,200
 These songs, if you will,

234
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,320
 are songs we need to hear again today.

235
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,440
 As we stand here still in 2021, looking towards 2022

236
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,160
 and trying to find hope in 2022,

237
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,360
 and yet facing the ongoing realities of the virus,

238
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,640
 a new form of the virus now called Omicron.

239
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,600
 Doesn't that sound really scary? Omicron.

240
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,640
 It's like a corporation of evil coming to get you.

241
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,480
 Omicron.

242
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,680
 And then our travel.

243
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,520
 What about our travel?

244
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,920
 Like we don't think we're gonna be able to travel again

245
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,240
 and for a long time,

246
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,640
 the quarantines are still gonna be here.

247
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,640
 We're trying to step into 2022 with a positive foot,

248
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,780
 but the realities are,

249
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,040
 perhaps we need songs of freedom again.

250
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,720
 Songs that could express something

251
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,640
 of the heart of God for this world.

252
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,680
 At Christmas time,

253
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,480
 the first song of Advent comes from the lungs

254
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,640
 of a pregnant teenage girl,

255
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,520
 shamed by her family,

256
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,200
 rejected by her fiance's family,

257
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
 who will eventually need to give birth

258
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 in the cold, damp darkness of a cave filled with animals.

259
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,000
 Songs for the not so holy.

260
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,960
 We know her, of course, of Mary.

261
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,440
 Mary, the mother of Jesus.

262
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,800
 And we look at Mary as this amazing figure of holiness

263
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,880
 and perfection and beauty and wonder.

264
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,920
 And yet when Luke introduces us to Mary

265
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,120
 in the Advent story, she's not like that at all.

266
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,920
 In fact, she's just a Jewish girl

267
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,400
 under the oppression of an empire,

268
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,240
 wondering whether there'll be ever hope

269
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,960
 for her and her family.

270
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,320
 And not only that, but then this angel shows up,

271
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,160
 angel Gabriel, and Luke introduces us to Mary

272
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,120
 with this great fanfare of this lowly girl,

273
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,960
 teenage girl, and this incredible Gabriel angel.

274
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,920
 And Gabriel says to her, "Oh, most highly favored one,

275
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,360
 "guess what?

276
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,480
 "You're pregnant, and you're carrying with you

277
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,520
 "not just any child,

278
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,840
 "but the one who will take the throne of David,

279
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,760
 "the one who will be established for all kingdoms,

280
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,600
 "for all eternity, it's in you."

281
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,960
 And Mary's like crickets.

282
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,560
 She's like, "Really?"

283
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,240
 And not surprisingly, perhaps, she's overwhelmed.

284
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,560
 She's overwhelmed with fear.

285
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,200
 She's wondering how is this going to work?

286
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,160
 She has lots of questions.

287
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,840
 Most of them are about logistics,

288
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,680
 about pregnancy and stuff.

289
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,200
 And so she says to angel Gabriel,

290
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,040
 "How can this happen?

291
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,720
 "Because I'm a virgin."

292
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,640
 Gabriel says, "The Holy Spirit has come upon you,

293
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,440
 "and the child that you're carrying,

294
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,760
 "it's amazing what is about to take place.

295
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,040
 "And even your cousin, Elizabeth, in her old age,

296
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,480
 "even she's pregnant, because nothing is impossible

297
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,640
 "with God."

298
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,840
 So Mary, a couple of months later, getting pretty pregnant,

299
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,720
 shows up at Elizabeth's house for tea and cakes.

300
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,280
 And as she walks into the home,

301
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,600
 Elizabeth is so overcome by the presence

302
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,880
 of the child in the womb of Mary,

303
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,560
 that her child leaps in her womb,

304
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,880
 and she feels the onrush of the Holy Spirit.

305
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,360
 And she's so overwhelmed with the obvious glory

306
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,560
 of the reality that her Messiah,

307
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,320
 this longed for, hoped for, liberator

308
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,520
 for an oppressed people, has walked into her room,

309
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,160
 walked into her house.

310
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,680
 And she's so overwhelmed with this,

311
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,120
 she's filled with the Spirit.

312
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,000
 And Elizabeth begins to prophesy over Mary

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,080
 and prophesy over this child and say,

314
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,520
 "This child is gonna be the changing point of history.

315
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,240
 "This child is gonna bring in a new era,

316
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,640
 "a new time where God has acted again to save His people."

317
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,920
 And in the wonder of this prophetic moment,

318
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,680
 Mary, all the dominoes suddenly fall together.

319
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,520
 All the pieces of the puzzle seem

320
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,320
 to suddenly come together for her.

321
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,440
 And she also is filled with the Holy Spirit.

322
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,080
 I would love to have been at this tea party.

323
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,800
 This would have been great.

324
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,720
 She also is filled with the Holy Spirit.

325
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,880
 And the scripture tells us that she begins

326
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,880
 to sing a song, a song of freedom, redemption songs,

327
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,280
 songs for the not so holy.

328
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
 She sings.

329
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,880
 When I am blessed with the Holy Spirit,

330
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,720
 I don't sing, and you should be very happy about that.

331
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
 But as she is overcome by the work of the Spirit

332
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,080
 in her life, she gives voice to a song.

333
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,200
 She wants to tell a story.

334
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,320
 She wants to exclaim what is about to take place

335
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,680
 'cause she realizes that if she is a part of God's plan,

336
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,200
 then God is saying something prophetically to the world.

337
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,840
 She understands that it is the lowly, the shamed,

338
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,280
 the forgotten, the rejected who can now stand up

339
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,560
 and give a voice to salvation and hope.

340
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,400
 She understands that people just like her,

341
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,320
 not so special, struggling in life,

342
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,280
 actually have a song they can now sing.

343
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,520
 I want you to know in this room,

344
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,080
 no matter how you are feeling,

345
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,680
 no matter what is going on in your life,

346
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,640
 no matter how you're entering into Advent,

347
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,720
 no matter what is taking place,

348
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,040
 you have a song to sing.

349
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,560
 And the question I have for you

350
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,360
 was the question in the video.

351
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,860
 Do you hear it?

352
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,960
 Do you hear the songs?

353
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,400
 Of redemption.

354
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,480
 And he write as he writes about this song of Mary,

355
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,600
 he puts it like this.

356
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,760
 I love how he puts it.

357
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,360
 He says, "It's the gospel before the gospel,

358
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,400
 a fierce, bright shout of triumph,

359
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,080
 30 weeks before Bethlehem,

360
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,200
 30 years before Calvary and Easter.

361
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,600
 It goes with a swing and a clap and a stamp.

362
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,800
 It's all about God and it's all about revolution."

363
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,120
 And he writes, "Capturing the idea of what this song is.

364
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,520
 It's not a (singing)

365
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,640
 It's a, come on,

366
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,280
 change is a coming kind of song."

367
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,160
 I'm gonna read that song to you

368
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,040
 and you better be stamping your feet

369
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,840
 and clapping your hands.

370
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,840
 Otherwise you need more protest songs being played for you.

371
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,280
 Are you ready?

372
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,840
 Everybody okay?

373
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,800
 You guys look a bit in shock.

374
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,680
 It's all right.

375
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,240
 I'm a nice guy.

376
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,960
 Luke one, starting in verse 46, Mary says this,

377
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,120
 "My soul glorifies the Lord

378
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,120
 and my spirit rejoices in God my savior.

379
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,080
 For he has been mindful of the humble state,

380
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,720
 the lowliness of his people and his servant.

381
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,200
 From now on, all generations will call me blessed

382
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,000
 for the mighty one has done great things for me.

383
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,240
 Holy is his name."

384
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,920
 This is where she begins to stamp a little bit.

385
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,120
 "His mercy extends to those who fear him.

386
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,080
 From generation to generation,

387
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,360
 he has performed mighty deeds with his arm.

388
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,240
 He has scattered those who are proud

389
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,480
 in their innermost thoughts.

390
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,240
 Oh, he has brought down rulers from their thrones,

391
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
 but has lifted up the humble.

392
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,920
 Oh, he has filled the hungry with good things,

393
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,760
 but sent away the rich empty.

394
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,000
 He has helped his servant Israel,

395
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,960
 remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants.

396
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,760
 Even as he has said to our fathers,

397
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,000
 can you hear me sing?"

398
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,440
 Now,

399
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,680
 very kind.

400
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,960
 This is a pregnant, unmarried teenage girl

401
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,640
 saying some pretty sociopolitically dangerous things.

402
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,960
 I mean, did you hear the language she uses?

403
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,080
 I mean, she says, "Scattering the proud."

404
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,520
 She says, "Pulling down those who rule and have authority."

405
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,480
 She talks about the idea that the wealthy,

406
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,080
 those that seem to have everything,

407
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,520
 are gonna go away empty.

408
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,360
 And those people that have nothing,

409
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,840
 they're gonna be filled.

410
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:55,040
 But she doesn't say this to try to get Israel

411
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,880
 to pick up arms and fight against the Romans.

412
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,080
 That is not what she's doing.

413
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,680
 'Cause I want you to see the beautiful thing.

414
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,880
 Although she's saying there's bad times,

415
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,760
 and although she's saying

416
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
 there are people that are oppressing us,

417
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,280
 she then flips it and says,

418
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,760
 "The help is not in us, but in God."

419
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,800
 She talks about his mercy.

420
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,120
 She talks that he's holy.

421
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,360
 She says that he has done mighty acts for us.

422
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,720
 In other words, there is one in our corner

423
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,280
 who is more powerful, with more authority,

424
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,920
 with more goodness, with mercy and grace,

425
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,080
 and he's at work.

426
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,040
 And she's like, "I'm literally carrying the one

427
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,840
 "who's gonna usher in a new era for us all."

428
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,280
 And this song is so beautiful

429
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,640
 because it gives us three very succinct,

430
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,200
 but clear and important themes for Advent.

431
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,720
 For anyone who is wanting Christ to come

432
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,240
 to them more and more.

433
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,120
 And that's a question for you

434
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,560
 as we start Advent in 2021.

435
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,880
 Do you long for Christ to come near?

436
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,840
 That the name of Christ at Christmas time,

437
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,800
 Emmanuel, means God with us.

438
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,480
 And the question is, is that true?

439
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,720
 Do you sense him?

440
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,880
 Do you know him?

441
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,120
 Do you feel him?

442
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,880
 Do you want him to come closer to you?

443
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,240
 Are you anticipating Advent?

444
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,320
 Which just means coming.

445
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,760
 Come, Lord Jesus, come.

446
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,480
 I wanna show you the three ways

447
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,160
 that Mary cries out in her song for Jesus to come.

448
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,200
 The first one is this idea of God as savior.

449
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,600
 Let me read the first verse.

450
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,320
 My soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God,

451
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,320
 my savior.

452
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,160
 Now it's really interesting

453
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,240
 because for us as Christians now,

454
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,640
 we hear the word savior all the time when we come to church.

455
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,840
 And it's almost heard so often for us

456
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,760
 that we've become to sort of misunderstand

457
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,640
 I think the weight of it.

458
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,920
 It's a very common word for us in 2021 in the church,

459
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
 but it was not a common word

460
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,680
 that was used very often in the first century

461
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,960
 because the word came with a lot of weight,

462
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,080
 with a lot of baggage.

463
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,240
 If you said that word, you needed to mean it.

464
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,920
 That word was reserved for talk about the Messiah.

465
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,160
 And by the time you get into the first century,

466
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,320
 there's been 400 years of silence for the Jewish people,

467
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,040
 400 years where they're wondering

468
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,800
 if the Messiah will ever come.

469
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,760
 So if you were to use the word savior,

470
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,880
 which links directly to the Messiah,

471
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,080
 well, you better have something to say about him.

472
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,080
 Otherwise keep your lips sealed.

473
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,160
 So this is a dangerous word she uses here.

474
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,400
 Now the word savior in the Hebrew, in the Old Testament,

475
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,200
 simply means to be rescued or delivered.

476
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,320
 In fact, it's sometimes translated rescuing

477
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,600
 or delivering in the Old Testament.

478
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,760
 It's the idea that only God has the ability

479
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,600
 to step in and to save me.

480
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,400
 Not specifically always,

481
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,160
 talking about how we often think about it

482
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,200
 is in like, I need to repent of my sin

483
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,520
 and be reconciled with God.

484
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,920
 Although of course it does mean that.

485
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,040
 But when Mary says it, before Jesus on the cross,

486
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,680
 when Mary uses the word,

487
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,400
 she's talking about liberation and deliverance.

488
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,960
 She's talking about a world-changing event.

489
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,840
 She's saying God is the one who can change everything.

490
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,520
 She's drawing primarily from Isaiah chapter 55 to 63.

491
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,960
 Now, Isaiah 55 to 63 is all talking

492
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,680
 about the coming of this Messiah

493
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,800
 and what's gonna happen when this Messiah comes.

494
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,520
 And the word that's repeated most

495
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,480
 in that section of our scriptures is salvation.

496
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,000
 Let me give you just some examples on the screen here.

497
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,080
 Maintain justice and do what is right,

498
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,640
 for my salvation is close at hand

499
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,920
 and my righteousness will soon be revealed.

500
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,160
 My righteousness draws near speedily.

501
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,400
 My salvation is on the way.

502
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,520
 My arm will bring justice to the nations.

503
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,400
 Can you hear the future hope of this, right?

504
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,200
 My salvation will last forever.

505
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,400
 My righteousness will never fail.

506
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,720
 All the ends of the earth

507
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,400
 will see the salvation of our God.

508
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,760
 Shout it aloud.

509
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,720
 Do not hold back.

510
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,080
 That's almost like sing a song, people.

511
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,600
 Raise your voice like a trumpet.

512
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,720
 Salvation is at hand.

513
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,360
 Loose the chains of injustice.

514
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,000
 Untie the cords of the yoke.

515
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,400
 Set the oppressed free.

516
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,240
 Break every yoke.

517
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,920
 For I will forgive your sin

518
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,960
 and turn away from you no more.

519
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,280
 This is the prophetic idea of what salvation was all about.

520
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,880
 Salvation from our enemies physically,

521
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,120
 but more than that,

522
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,240
 salvation from our sin that holds us captive.

523
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,840
 And in Isaiah, when Isaiah is saying,

524
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,640
 "There is one," God is saying,

525
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,640
 "in the future, coming soon,

526
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,400
 "will be one that will liberate you,

527
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,920
 "save you from both your enemies and from your sin,

528
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,560
 "which is the ultimate enemy,

529
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,760
 "that one you call Messiah."

530
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,200
 So she starts the song with that word

531
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,720
 just to stir up a bit of controversy amongst her people.

532
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,800
 That Messiah, he's coming.

533
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,840
 'Cause God indeed is about to prove

534
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,200
 he's a deliverer of his people.

535
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,120
 I wonder if that's how you think of Jesus

536
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,720
 as you end 2021.

537
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,160
 I wonder if that's been your experience this year.

538
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,400
 I wonder if that's been your prayer.

539
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,040
 I wonder if that's been the song that's been on your lips.

540
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,280
 God is my deliverer.

541
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,960
 I think so often when times are hard, when times are dark,

542
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,720
 we often end up a little bit like Israel.

543
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,760
 Israel, who for 400 years were wondering

544
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,160
 if this Messiah would ever come

545
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,480
 and have begun to distance themselves

546
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,800
 a little bit from hope,

547
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,440
 begun to distance themselves a little bit

548
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,880
 from the reality that God could be a savior.

549
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,080
 And this is Mary essentially going,

550
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,560
 "This is a wake up call, Israel,

551
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,400
 "a wake up call that he has not given up on us.

552
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,000
 "He is indeed this deliverer.

553
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,160
 "And just because we've had to wait so long

554
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,720
 "does not diminish the power of his character.

555
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,680
 "He will deliver and set us free."

556
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,560
 I think this is interesting because for us

557
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,920
 in cold, dark, uncertain, fearful, overwhelmed times,

558
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,880
 I think so often the last thing we remember

559
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,640
 is God is our deliverer.

560
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,480
 And we begin to look for other things that deliver us,

561
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,480
 alcohol, sex, money, internet, squid game,

562
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,360
 whatever it is, are you with me?

563
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,360
 We look for other things, don't we, to be our deliverer

564
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,080
 because we forget that actually it's God

565
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,960
 who is the true deliverer.

566
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,920
 This is why, and this is powerful,

567
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,920
 when we forget to be mindful of God in our hard times,

568
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,520
 God is always mindful of us.

569
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,960
 This is why she says here,

570
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,240
 "For he has been mindful of the state,

571
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,360
 "the humble state of me."

572
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,600
 She talks about the reality that God has been mindful of her

573
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
 even though she may have given up on him,

574
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,640
 even though she didn't really fully understand

575
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,440
 what was going on, God had not given up on his people.

576
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,160
 God had not forgotten his people.

577
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,000
 He's ever mindful.

578
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,120
 Mary is drawing from Exodus.

579
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,080
 Is this okay, everybody's all right?

580
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,320
 Am I going too quickly?

581
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,440
 I feel like I'm speeding up a bit.

582
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,880
 All right.

583
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,200
 This is Mary going back to Exodus chapter two

584
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,880
 where God pulls back the curtain.

585
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,680
 He sees the slavery of his people.

586
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,000
 He comes down and he says, "In my compassion,

587
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,520
 "I have compassion because I have seen my people

588
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,960
 "crying out in their slavery."

589
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,240
 In other words, I've been mindful of my people.

590
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,320
 This is Mary many years later saying the same thing.

591
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,520
 We're still in slavery, but God is mindful of those

592
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,040
 who are in a humble state.

593
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,160
 Some of you in this room need to know

594
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,960
 that God is mindful of you right now.

595
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,320
 Whatever is going on in your life,

596
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,720
 whatever it is that you're struggling with,

597
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,040
 whatever you're finding hard,

598
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,800
 you've perhaps distanced yourself from him.

599
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,640
 He has not distanced himself from you.

600
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,480
 He's mindful of those who are in a humble state,

601
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,960
 who are lowly, which is wonderful

602
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,080
 because so often as Christians,

603
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,480
 we think we have to get perfect

604
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,120
 before God takes notice of us.

605
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,040
 We think we have to brush up all of our sin

606
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,720
 before God's going to be doing something for us.

607
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,280
 We think if we want God's blessing,

608
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,040
 then we have to act or be or do in a certain way.

609
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,200
 The great story of Christmas, the message of Christmas

610
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,880
 is that Jesus was born into a dark, damp cave

611
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,360
 to tell us that he can be born

612
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,680
 into the darkness of our hearts.

613
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,120
 Before we're all cleaned up and nice and shiny,

614
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,240
 he's been mindful of the lowly state of his people

615
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,200
 and he has not left us in that lowly state.

616
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,280
 I want you to know today,

617
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,840
 no matter what's going on in your life,

618
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,400
 no matter what sin you're struggling with,

619
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,840
 no matter what mistakes you've made,

620
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,200
 whatever regrets that you carry,

621
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,320
 whatever baggage the enemy would try to lay upon you,

622
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
 God is mindful of you.

623
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,160
 He loves you.

624
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,200
 This is the message of Christmas and Advent.

625
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,480
 He's come for you even when you were still a sinner

626
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,980
 to set you free.

627
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,440
 Ah, thank God that he's been mindful

628
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,200
 of the lowly state of his servant

629
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,140
 so I can sing of a redemption song.

630
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,280
 The second thing she does is she talks here

631
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,640
 about God having the power of transformation.

632
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,920
 Let me read this to you from verse 50.

633
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,560
 It says, "His mercy extends to those who fear him

634
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,220
 "from generation to generation."

635
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,400
 She says this beautiful thing.

636
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,620
 She says there's mercy in God, mercy in his heart.

637
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,940
 The mercy here, the Hebrew is basically,

638
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,100
 from the Hebrew, the Old Testament,

639
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,560
 which is where she's drawing from.

640
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,640
 The word literally means loving faithfulness.

641
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,340
 There's a faithful love of God for you,

642
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,060
 a faithful love of God that is unlike anything for you.

643
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,460
 And that loving faithfulness of God

644
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,320
 extends to those who fear him.

645
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,500
 Again, another Old Testament reference.

646
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,740
 Fearing him just basically means

647
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,540
 to humble ourselves before God,

648
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,580
 to recognize that he's in control, we're not,

649
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,460
 to recognize that he's the power, we're not.

650
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,900
 Fearing God is this humble submission

651
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,860
 to his authority in our lives.

652
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,660
 She says when we do that,

653
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,780
 we have one whose loving faithfulness never gives up on us.

654
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,860
 This is a wonderful thing.

655
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,140
 But Mary is also willing,

656
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,320
 as an unmarried, pregnant teenage girl,

657
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,700
 to also say to everybody, not just a note of goodness,

658
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,900
 oh, he's been mindful of those who fear him,

659
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,400
 but also a note of warning,

660
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,760
 'cause if you don't fear him, there's trouble.

661
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,400
 And she gives these examples.

662
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,460
 She says, you know what he does to the proud?

663
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,540
 Oh, the proud gets scattered.

664
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,080
 You know what he does to the rulers,

665
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,240
 the ones who lorded over everybody?

666
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,320
 They are brought down.

667
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,580
 You wanna know what happens to the wealthy

668
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,280
 that don't look after the poor around them,

669
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,160
 the wealthy that hoard it all for themselves

670
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,420
 and are selfish?

671
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,040
 They will go away empty,

672
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,360
 but those that are hungry right now will be fed.

673
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,800
 That's our God.

674
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,760
 Merciful to those who fear him,

675
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,220
 but those who are unjust,

676
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,780
 those who don't hold his character,

677
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,880
 those that don't live in the ways that would please him,

678
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,280
 these ones,

679
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,280
 watch God come to set the oppressed free.

680
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,520
 This power of transformation,

681
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,820
 this reversal is quite powerful

682
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,040
 because this is the first time in the New Testament

683
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,800
 where we begin to see a picture of Jesus's ministry.

684
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,620
 We know that Jesus will come and live a ministry

685
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,360
 of inaugurating the kingdom of God,

686
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
 a kingdom that turns everything upside down,

687
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,200
 a kingdom that changes everything that happens.

688
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,200
 And Christ would preach himself on the Sermon on the Mount.

689
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,920
 I've come so that these reversals,

690
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,400
 these changes can take place.

691
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,920
 The mourning amongst you will rejoice.

692
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,720
 The poor in spirit will know the kingdom of God.

693
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,300
 And he begins to lay out the beatitudes,

694
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,060
 this beautiful idea that in God's hands,

695
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,260
 reversal takes place, change and transformation happens.

696
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,660
 Those that were first will be last,

697
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,920
 but the last will be first.

698
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,080
 And before any of that takes place,

699
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,440
 Mary carrying the very one that would do it,

700
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,780
 sings a song of what he will do.

701
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,960
 Change and transform.

702
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,540
 Now, as a faithful Jewish person in the first century,

703
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,980
 you would hear this song and immediately you'd be like,

704
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,800
 woo-hoo, God's gonna act to tear down

705
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,600
 those rulers in front of us, woo-hoo.

706
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,300
 We've longed for that moment,

707
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,640
 but they would have completely missed

708
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,600
 what she's saying here, because what she's saying is this.

709
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:45,140
 We have to be really careful that those that were oppressed

710
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,400
 when they gained their freedom don't become the oppressor.

711
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,340
 And we shouldn't think that this is all about

712
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,460
 the nasty Gentiles and the wonderful Jews.

713
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,020
 We need to realize that this warning is for all of us,

714
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,140
 that we might be in a position of power one day,

715
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,420
 how are we going to lead?

716
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,780
 We might be the ones that actually end up enslaving others,

717
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,460
 that we gotta be really careful to fear the Lord

718
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,380
 or the reversal will also happen to us.

719
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:17,700
 This is a song of triumph, but it is also a sober warning

720
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,340
 to a people that have been longing to be free,

721
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,880
 to not abuse the freedom they're about to receive.

722
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,240
 Stay fearing Him is what she's singing.

723
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,920
 And if you do that, you can know that it'll always

724
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,640
 be loving and faithful to the humble of heart.

725
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,360
 Third thing he says is this, that God is in control.

726
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,600
 Look at the last few verses here.

727
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,320
 She says in verse 54, "He has helped His servant Israel,

728
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,920
 "remembering to be merciful to Abraham

729
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,960
 "and his descendants forever."

730
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,880
 This is really important.

731
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,960
 She doesn't basically say, look, this whole idea

732
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,760
 of God coming and saving us, delivering us

733
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,120
 from both our enemies and sin and redeeming us,

734
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,520
 all of this is not a new idea for God.

735
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,520
 She very importantly links us all the way back to Abraham,

736
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,560
 back to the very founding father of the Jewish people,

737
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
 all the way back to that moment in Genesis 12,

738
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,880
 where God shows up and says,

739
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,760
 "Your descendants will be like the many stars

740
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,240
 "and you'll be a blessing to all nations."

741
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,220
 She goes right back to there and she says,

742
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,280
 "From that very moment, God has been planning this moment."

743
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,000
 It's not a new idea, but it is a new season.

744
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,080
 It's not a new idea, but it is a new covenant.

745
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,520
 It's not a new idea, but it is new wine

746
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,260
 about to get poured in the new wine skin.

747
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,280
 There's a whole history of redemption

748
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,760
 that God has been working His way towards.

749
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,280
 And she's basically saying to her people,

750
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,440
 isn't it amazing that we get to live in this moment

751
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,780
 where that actual longing for Messiah breaks in?

752
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,780
 Oh, would we sing a song of those who are not so holy,

753
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:02,160
 but have hope in a future not so distant.

754
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:09,580
 How much more then, when we think about these three ideas

755
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:14,440
 of salvation and transformation and sovereignty,

756
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,120
 how much more then should we here in 2021 sing this song?

757
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,220
 How much more us who have seen the life and the death

758
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,700
 and the resurrection of Jesus,

759
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,100
 us who have this story written down for us in words,

760
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,860
 but the story also encountered in us by the Spirit of God,

761
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:36,180
 how much more for us who have had 2,000 years

762
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,460
 of church history where the Spirit has been at work

763
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,980
 in the church declaring the song of freedom and liberation,

764
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,720
 how much more then for us should we now sing?

765
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,360
 Hear and sing well.

766
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,500
 Jesus would say these words to those that would follow Him,

767
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,460
 those that have ears, let them hear.

768
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,780
 And there's this song that sings out at Christmas time,

769
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,300
 a melody that goes forth to the world of a King

770
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,180
 who has come to save us and save and deliver us,

771
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,740
 not by saying, hey, some insurrection needs to happen,

772
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,020
 but by simply saying this, I'm willing to die

773
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,240
 so that you can know life.

774
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,120
 One who's willing to lay down his life

775
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,340
 for the sin of this world

776
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,380
 so that we might know forgiveness and reconciliation.

777
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,660
 One who raises from death to show us

778
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,200
 that death doesn't have the final say.

779
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,440
 One who sends his Spirit to fill the church

780
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,620
 so the church would know the power of resurrection,

781
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,320
 not just on the pages of a book,

782
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,560
 but on the beating hearts of their lives.

783
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,760
 Ones who can then go into their society, their context,

784
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,680
 and begin to live out that hope like never before.

785
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,280
 As we go from 2021 to 2022,

786
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,760
 as we prepare over the next four weeks to arrive in Advent,

787
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,240
 this arrival of Jesus coming to the world,

788
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,960
 how much more should we stamp our feet,

789
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,960
 clap our hands, and declare a song for the redeemed?

790
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,760
 A redemption song.

791
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,800
 Maybe not like Bob Marley's,

792
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,320
 looking in the ways that he did,

793
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,320
 but like Mary's, declaring a God who saves,

794
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,000
 transforms, and is in control,

795
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,720
 even in Hong Kong in 2021.

796
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,760
 Can we sing a song of redemption?

797
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,100
 Let's close our eyes and let's pray.

798
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:41,760
 Father, we are just so grateful,

799
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,760
 so grateful for the coming of your Spirit,

800
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,160
 the coming of Jesus,

801
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,640
 for that Christmas and the stable and the songs.

802
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,660
 And Lord, we now come to you as your people,

803
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:02,080
 grateful for Mary, the mother of Jesus,

804
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,400
 who faces a crisis pregnancy

805
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,520
 that's not understood by those around her,

806
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,840
 and yet by the power of the Holy Spirit

807
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,480
 is able to declare before all her people

808
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,300
 that salvation has come, will come, and is coming.

809
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,940
 And Lord, as I stand before these incredible people,

810
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,160
 both online right now, watching this, wherever they are,

811
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,400
 and those in this room,

812
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,680
 Lord, I declare over them as well

813
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,640
 that that coming Jesus is here.

814
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,920
 And perhaps you've come in today and you didn't know Jesus,

815
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,960
 and maybe you've been invited by a friend,

816
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,520
 or you're curious about spirituality in this time.

817
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,200
 I want you to know that there is a Savior

818
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,600
 who has been mindful of you,

819
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,520
 who knows you better than you know yourself,

820
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,320
 knows all the good you've done,

821
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,120
 the bad you've done, the ugly you've done,

822
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,320
 and a God who says, "None of that truly matters

823
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,680
 'cause my son, Jesus, has paid already for it all."

824
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,320
 A God who now extends his mighty arm as Mary sings about.

825
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,640
 He's done great things for you.

826
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:26,240
 And so if you're here this morning and that's your reality,

827
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,680
 I want you to know that this God is available for you

828
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,180
 to meet, to be in relationship with.

829
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,860
 And he extends an invitation to you.

830
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,380
 And that invitation is simple.

831
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:43,380
 It's just you to say, "Jesus, I need you, I want you."

832
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,780
 And it's really a simple prayer to pray,

833
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,940
 just, "Jesus, would you come into my life?

834
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,660
 "I'm sorry for the things that I've done

835
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,260
 "that have hurt you and hurt me and hurt others around me.

836
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,860
 "Would you forgive me, Lord?

837
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,260
 "And would you help with the power of your Spirit

838
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,620
 "for me to get to know you?"

839
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,940
 So just three things, acknowledgement of God,

840
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,820
 asking for his forgiveness, asking for his Spirit

841
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,660
 to help in your relationship with him.

842
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,860
 And we'd be happy to pray that prayer with you

843
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,380
 after this service if that's you,

844
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,980
 if you'd like to make that prayer.

845
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,140
 You can make it on your own in this moment.

846
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,020
 You can make that standing with us in a moment as well.

847
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,140
 We wanna help you in your journey if that's you.

848
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,060
 And for the rest of us that are already Christian

849
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,060
 in this room, may Mary's song shake the dust off of you

850
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,500
 and cause you to walk out of this room

851
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,700
 with your head held a bit higher,

852
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,700
 knowing that there is a song to be sung,

853
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,860
 regardless of your situation or circumstance,

854
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,180
 a Savior, a transformer, one in control,

855
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,700
 and you can find your hope always in him.

856
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,700
 Father, we just thank you for this

857
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,980
 and give you glory for it.

858
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:05,280
 for it in Jesus name everyone says
