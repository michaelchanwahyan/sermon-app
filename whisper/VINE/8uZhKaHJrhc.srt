1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 In Jesus' name, everyone says, Amen.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Amen.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,560
 Why don't you have a seat.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,920
 If you're new to the Vine, my name is Andrew.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,040
 I'm one of the pastors here.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,360
 We're so glad you're with us.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,680
 And you know, oftentimes when I get into the pulpit, I'll share with you that I'm super

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,080
 excited about what I'm going to share today.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,240
 But it actually is really true today.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,200
 I'm really super excited about what we're going to be doing today and in the weeks ahead.

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,120
 We start a brand new sermon series today, and it's really one that I feel like I've

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,600
 been carrying for some time.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,960
 And so it's always a joy for me to be able to carry something in my spirit on behalf

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,640
 of us for a season and then be able to come in and just bring what it is that the Lord

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
 wants to say to us.

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,960
 And so I'm excited to do that here this afternoon.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,040
 I want to teach over the next four weeks on the topic of personal transformation.

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
 Personal transformation.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,440
 And I don't know how you felt as you've come into church this afternoon.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,120
 Perhaps some of you come in here full of life, full of excitement, full of joy.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,640
 Perhaps some of you come in and things are hard at the moment.

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,040
 You've been wrestling with stuff.

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,920
 There's things going on that are quite serious for you, whether you're full of life right

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,280
 now or whether you feel like you're sort of on the edge at the moment.

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,020
 The weight of Scripture would say this.

26
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,640
 The weight of Scripture would say that one of the primary purposes of the ministry of

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,180
 Jesus is to meet us where we're at and to move us towards becoming more like him.

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,740
 This is really the heart of personal transformation.

29
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,700
 The Lord is not interested in trying to help you to, I don't know, just be a nicer person

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,660
 or to help you to be the best person at workplace that you can be.

31
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,900
 What the Lord wants to do in your life is transform it so that you'd become more and

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,780
 more like him, so that you'd reflect more and more of his nature and his heart so that

33
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,100
 you would be his hands and feet to a broken world around you.

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,100
 The transformation that the Lord is looking to do in your life is not just to kind of

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,660
 polish up some of your rough edges.

36
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:05,820
 It is to transform us into his people, his people that are released by this great commission

37
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,620
 to go into all the world with this hope that we can disciple the nations, that we can see

38
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:16,260
 people baptized, immersed, the Greek word immersed in the name of the Father, the Son

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,260
 and the Holy Spirit.

40
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,220
 And that people would know that he is with them now until the ends of the age.

41
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,020
 So however you come in today, you come in because the heart of the Father and the purpose

42
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:36,060
 of the Spirit and the primary focus of Jesus is that you would become more like Christ,

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,380
 that you would mature to come as Paul would write in Ephesians 4, to the wholeness of

44
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,620
 the wholeness of Christ.

45
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,140
 What a glorious picture it is that we get to grow in Christ Jesus together.

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,540
 And so what that means is that you have not come to church this afternoon for an event.

47
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,260
 You haven't come here just to connect to something.

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,860
 You've come here because there's something in your life that the Lord wants to touch,

49
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,940
 wants to liberate, wants to maybe heal in you, wants to restore.

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,780
 That's his heart to meet you where you are right now in whatever is going on and to bring

51
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,580
 you to that person that he longs you to be.

52
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:25,100
 In many ways, this is really the very heart of the season that we're in here as a church.

53
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,220
 Back in the first Sunday of March on Vision Sunday, I released to us what we sense as

54
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,380
 the senior leadership here is the whole heart of God for us as a community this year.

55
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,100
 And it's this idea of being moved into uncharted territory.

56
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,540
 That's the phrase that we've been using a lot over this year.

57
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,060
 And really the heart of the uncharted territory that God has for us as the bind is to take

58
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,220
 us from a place that we know to a place that we don't know.

59
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,900
 The whole definition of something that is uncharted means that we've never been there

60
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,580
 before, that there is no map or strategy or resource available to understand that place.

61
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,660
 We've never been there.

62
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,740
 We've never gone there.

63
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,760
 There's nothing we can rely on in that place other than God, because it's completely out

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,820
 of our comfort zone.

65
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,580
 And when the Lord brings to a church community that I'm going to move you into a place where

66
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,940
 I'm going to take you out of your comfort zone and place you in a place where you've

67
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,940
 never been before, that has something to say with the people that we are.

68
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,900
 That is something to say about the transformation that he longs to do inside of us.

69
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,820
 And as we head into the second half of our year here, and as we kind of unpack a little

70
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,260
 bit deeper what this uncharted season is all about, I believe it's got something to say

71
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,300
 about what's going on in your life right now.

72
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,380
 Something to say about this uncharted place that the Lord wants to take you.

73
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,620
 I believe that if you open your heart over the next four weeks, as we teach around this

74
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,700
 topic, there are going to be some keys for you that will bring you into a place where

75
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,500
 you have never been in your relationship with Jesus before.

76
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,220
 A place where you have never been in the relationships around you before.

77
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,300
 A place where you've never been in the operation of your gifts before.

78
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,940
 That's what the Lord wants to do.

79
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,820
 Take you to a place where you have never been before so you can shine for his glory in the

80
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,100
 world like never before.

81
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,220
 Is everybody okay?

82
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,340
 Is everybody okay?

83
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,620
 Well on Vision Sunday, I read to us a word that I sensed that the Lord had given me as

84
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,900
 I was on the Camino de Santiago last year, the walk across Spain during my sabbatical.

85
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,900
 And during that time I was praying for us as a church one day and I felt this kind of

86
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,060
 download of God's heart for us.

87
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,420
 And I read this to us back on that Sunday but I wanted to read it again to us.

88
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,220
 I wrote it down as I was walking on this very piece of paper here.

89
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,700
 And I want to read this because this really captures the heart of the uncharted season

90
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:59,140
 we're in but also captures the heart of every person on a journey of personal transformation.

91
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,460
 It says this, "I'm about to move," this is God speaking to us, "I'm about to move the

92
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,020
 vine into uncharted territory.

93
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,840
 For I desire to take you to places that you have never been to stretch you beyond what

94
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,220
 you're currently comfortable with.

95
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,540
 These are uncharted territories and they're necessary for your faith and my work.

96
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:26,740
 You do not have the strategy, resources, gift or wisdom for what is coming but that is not

97
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,140
 the issue.

98
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,420
 All you need to begin is faith and courage."

99
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,580
 I believe that the greatest moments of your personal transformation are just ahead of

100
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,020
 you and all you need, you don't need the road map, you don't need all the resources, you

101
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,820
 don't even know what the Lord is about to do.

102
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,380
 All you need right at the start is faith and courage.

103
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,060
 And I want to just before anything just pray that into us as a church.

104
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,980
 I've been doing this at each of our services, I want to do it to you.

105
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,020
 Lord, I want to pray over each person in this room that you are seeking and longing to make

106
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,900
 into the very people that you long for them to be.

107
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,320
 I want to pray faith and courage in the name of Jesus.

108
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,100
 Faith to maybe look at some things in their lives that they are desperately in need of

109
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,780
 changing.

110
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,720
 Courage to trust that you have their best interest at heart.

111
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,980
 Faith and courage to do the work that you might be calling them to do to bring their

112
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,540
 life more aligned with your kingdom.

113
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,900
 Lord, I pray that you would seep this faith and courage inside of us by your spirit this

114
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,660
 afternoon and may it be for your glory in Jesus name.

115
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,880
 Amen.

116
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
 Let me carry on.

117
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,220
 This is about complete trust in me.

118
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,860
 What I will give you though is a burden.

119
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,300
 I will give you a new heart.

120
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,100
 I will make you understand or sorry, make you unsatisfied for the here and now.

121
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,180
 I will place my hand upon you and stir up the joy of the pursuit of me.

122
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,100
 I am not calling you to a vision with knowledge of all that is ahead.

123
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,380
 No, this is uncharted territory.

124
00:07:53,380 --> 00:08:01,260
 What I'm calling you to is a value, the value of complete and total surrender, a holy dissatisfaction

125
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,980
 in the way things have been and a passionate longing for the discovery of more.

126
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,300
 And then I wrote in brackets on the piece of paper, "Preach this sometime."

127
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,220
 But that really is a summary of the heart of personal transformation.

128
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,760
 This holy dissatisfaction for how things are and a longing for the discovery of more.

129
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,500
 The recognition that what we need is not a road map and some strategies and programs,

130
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,380
 but a greater trust and faith and courage in the Lord so that we might receive a new

131
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,900
 heart, that He would place a burden inside of us that we're not satisfied for the here

132
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,900
 and now.

133
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,380
 We're not satisfied for how we've always been.

134
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,460
 We're not satisfied for the way in which it seems that the Lord is at work in our city,

135
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,580
 but we're pressing in.

136
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,920
 We're calling out.

137
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,620
 We want to be in the uncharted.

138
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,980
 We want to be in a place where we've never been before with a burden to say a holy dissatisfaction

139
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:04,260
 in what is happening here and a longing for the pursuit of more in my life.

140
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,660
 I've been praying this exact passion for us as a church since Vision Sunday over the last

141
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,660
 six months.

142
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,140
 I've been kind of praying and just bringing this in my spirit for you.

143
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,100
 And as I've been doing so, I was led by the Lord about four months ago to the book of

144
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,460
 Ezra in the Old Testament.

145
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,100
 Now, I don't know if you've ever read the book of Ezra before.

146
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,460
 I'm not sure if you've ever heard anyone preach from the book of Ezra before, but the book

147
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,580
 of Ezra sits in one of the most critical turning points of Israel's history.

148
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,220
 In fact, it's one of the books that chronicles one of the most uncharted moments of their

149
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,300
 history.

150
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,380
 It talks about the time where God releases his people from their 70 years of captivity

151
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:51,700
 in Babylon and brings them back to Jerusalem, a city that has been destroyed and desolated

152
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,020
 by the Babylonians some 70 years before.

153
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:01,300
 The book of Ezra chronicles that time of that movement between the exile in Babylon back

154
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,900
 to Jerusalem.

155
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:09,740
 And as I was reading this sense of what the Lord has on his heart for us, there were so

156
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,500
 many things that were kind of moving inside of me as I was seeing this picture of God's

157
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:22,340
 people in an uncharted time doing something fresh and new out of the rubble of the old.

158
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,380
 Now to help you to understand this, I need to give you a bit of history and context to

159
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,880
 the book of Ezra.

160
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,740
 So why don't we just start there briefly.

161
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:36,260
 So about 800 years before the birth of Jesus, Israel at that time was a confederacy of 12

162
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,260
 tribes.

163
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,140
 And those 12 tribes were united around judges who were their leaders.

164
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,900
 So around about 800 years before Christ, one of the judges at the time, the elders of the

165
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:53,060
 12 tribes came to that judge Samuel and said, "We don't want other judges to lead us in

166
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,060
 the future.

167
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,660
 We want to become a kingdom.

168
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,380
 We want to become a monarchy.

169
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,580
 We want you to establish a king to rule us."

170
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,420
 And the reason why Israel wanted that is they looked at the other nations around them and

171
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,380
 they saw all these nations that had kings and queens and they decided that that was

172
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,420
 the best thing for them.

173
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,460
 Now God in his mercy and in his grace and compassion agreed to do that.

174
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,540
 And so the first king was established Saul and then after Saul, the next king, David.

175
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,820
 But what the Jewish people didn't understand, what the Israelites did not understand at

176
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:29,220
 that time is when they were 12 tribe confederacy, the judges could come from any of those 12

177
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,220
 tribes.

178
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,940
 But as soon as they became a kingship with a monarchy, that was then about the bloodline

179
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,500
 of the family who were the monarchs.

180
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,420
 So David as the archetype king, his bloodline was now going to be who the king would be

181
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,940
 to rise up.

182
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,220
 Not surprisingly, even though they didn't realize this at the time, they soon discovered

183
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,340
 the people of Israel that not everybody liked the fact that it would be David's bloodline

184
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,380
 that would bring the next king and they rebelled against it.

185
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,380
 About 800 years before Christ's birth, the kingdom split into two.

186
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,060
 Ten of the tribes went up north to the area that we kind of understand as the West Bank

187
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,300
 all the way up to southern Lebanon today.

188
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,780
 In that area, the ten tribes settled themselves there.

189
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,660
 They left Jerusalem, they went up north and annoyingly and confusingly when you're reading

190
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,060
 the Old Testament, they renamed themselves Israel.

191
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,860
 So there was Israel before the 12 tribes, then they split, ten up top, two in the south.

192
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,140
 The ten at the top renamed themselves Israel and that becomes who they are.

193
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,420
 So when you're reading the books of Ezra and Nehemiah and Zechariah and Jeremiah and the

194
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,340
 latter half of Isaiah, when they mention Israel, they're not talking about all 12 tribes, they're

195
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,780
 talking about those ten tribes that are north.

196
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,780
 The two tribes that remain in Jerusalem, that's Benjamin and Judah, they take on the name

197
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,940
 Judah.

198
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,100
 So when you read in the Old Testament about Judah as a nation, those were the two tribes

199
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,540
 that remained in Jerusalem.

200
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,820
 Now here's what happened.

201
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:02,200
 In 722 BC, Assyria attacks from the north and attacks the ten tribes that had gone up

202
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,340
 north and they basically desecrate those ten tribes.

203
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,220
 They kill most of the men in those tribes and then they intermarry with most of the

204
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:18,260
 women, creating a kind of new sort of race of people that were half Assyrian, half Jewish.

205
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,460
 And fascinatingly, later on in the biblical story in the New Testament when Jesus is doing

206
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,580
 his ministry, if you remember the Jewish people really hated the Samaritans who were up north,

207
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:33,000
 the Samaritans was the result of the half Assyrian, half Jewish creation.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,020
 This is why in those New Testament passages they say, "Oh, the half breeds, those Samaritans."

209
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,360
 That's where it comes from.

210
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,380
 So in 722, that Lego army, can you see on the screen, of Assyria came and attacked those

211
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,380
 ten tribes.

212
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:53,400
 Now, at about 605 BC, another nation, Babylon, comes from the east and attacks the two tribes

213
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,760
 in Jerusalem.

214
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,540
 And they do some significant things, they break down the walls of Jerusalem, they break

215
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,940
 down the temple, they destroy the temple of Jerusalem, literally make it into rubble.

216
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,920
 And then they take a remnant of the Jewish people back into captivity in Babylon, which

217
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,660
 is where they are for 70 years.

218
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,200
 Well fast forward just a little bit later and another nation is raised up.

219
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,920
 This is the nation Persia.

220
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,640
 And Persia comes and attacks Babylon now.

221
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,820
 They come from the east of Babylon, they attack Babylon, and when they do that, they realize

222
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,640
 that there is this remnant of Jewish people in Babylon.

223
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,940
 And they realize that these people have a home back in Jerusalem, and so King Cyrus

224
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:39,700
 of Persia, he actually gives permission for the Jewish people after 70 years to finally

225
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:46,660
 go back and reestablish themselves in Jerusalem, and the book of Ezra tells that story.

226
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,780
 Now, there are three waves of Jewish returnees back to Jerusalem.

227
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,780
 They did it in three waves under the leadership of a particular person with a particular purpose.

228
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:03,800
 Zerubbabel led the first wave, and Zerubbabel's permission and objective was to reestablish

229
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,180
 and rebuild the temple.

230
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,140
 The second wave was done by Nehemiah, and Nehemiah was to rebuild the walls.

231
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:17,220
 The third was Ezra, and Ezra led the third wave to reestablish the law.

232
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,460
 So these three things, reestablishing and rebuilding the temple, reestablishing and

233
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,860
 rebuilding the walls around Jerusalem, and then placing the law back in the hearts of

234
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,180
 the Jewish people was the focus of the return of the Israelites at this time.

235
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,420
 And Ezra was responsible for instituting the law back in everyone's hearts.

236
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,860
 Now, here's the really confusing thing, stay with me.

237
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,940
 Here's the really confusing thing.

238
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,580
 The book of Ezra actually doesn't talk about Ezra reestablishing the law.

239
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,580
 That actually is taught to us in Nehemiah, the book of Nehemiah.

240
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,380
 In Ezra, what we see is a picture of the rebuilding of the temple.

241
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:56,780
 Ezra tells the story of Zerubbabel and Zerubbabel's efforts in rebuilding the temple, particularly

242
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,220
 in chapter three.

243
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,420
 And what you see in chapter three is this profound picture.

244
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:08,260
 There's Ezra describing the moment where him and all the other elders of Israel are standing

245
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:16,060
 with their feet in the ruins of the old temple, in literally the rubble of the old temple,

246
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:22,420
 as they watch the builders begin to construct the foundations for the new temple out of

247
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,100
 the rubble of the old.

248
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:30,860
 I wonder if you could imagine being there on that day, standing in the ruins of a temple

249
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:39,740
 before and out of those very rubbles and ruins begin to see a new temple being built.

250
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,380
 As I read this, something really shifted in my spirit, shifted for me personally, but

251
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,740
 I think also for us as a church community, because I don't know about you, but I can

252
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,260
 recognize that there are still some things in my life that lie in ruin.

253
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:01,880
 I know that there are still some things of rubble within me, some things of my past that

254
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,860
 maybe I haven't fully dealt with, some words that have been spoken that still seem to have

255
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,260
 an impact on me.

256
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,860
 I've talked a lot here about the insecurities that I struggle with in life, and I can still

257
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,660
 see the ruins and the rubble of those insecurities at work in me.

258
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,100
 Maybe some sin that I know has been there and I've struggled and wrestled to try to

259
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,700
 release myself from it.

260
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,460
 I can see and feel the ruins and the rubble of some of myself that is still in my life.

261
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:34,940
 And so when I read this passage of Ezra and his people standing in the rubble of the old,

262
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,620
 as God begins to build the new, something begins to lift and hope in me.

263
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,560
 Perhaps that resonates with you here this afternoon as well.

264
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,500
 Perhaps if you're honest with yourself, you would recognize that there are some things

265
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,140
 that lay in ruin within you too.

266
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,500
 Maybe each one of us could share a story of some of the rubble that seems to still be

267
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 there.

268
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,480
 Again, maybe for some of you it's an old relationship.

269
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,980
 Maybe a marriage that didn't work out, a relationship that didn't work out that still seems to be

270
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,420
 like rubble within you.

271
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,540
 Maybe it was a hope or a prayer or you put all your trust in something and it didn't

272
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
 work out.

273
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,960
 Maybe a relationship broke or someone betrayed you or a word was spoken that really hurt

274
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,120
 you deeply and there's been a traumatic event that you've not been able to let go of and

275
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,460
 you recognize that there's still some of that rubble there.

276
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,700
 There's still some of that ruin within yourself and you know that you're not fully the person

277
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,660
 that you long to be.

278
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,980
 Sometimes we have to recognize that we're still standing in a bit of rubble.

279
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,260
 And if that resonates with you, within the next four weeks is an exciting season for

280
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,300
 you because we're going to look through this passage in Ezra and we're going to unpack

281
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,580
 a number of things through that passage that I think is going to help you to begin to recognize

282
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:56,340
 the rubble and begin to release and remove and basically transform into that person that

283
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,340
 he longed you to be.

284
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,060
 I want to use the analogy, if you will, of the rebuilding of the second temple to be

285
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,660
 an analogy of what the Holy Spirit wants to do in your life.

286
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,660
 Remember what Paul would say, that you are a temple of the Holy Spirit.

287
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,060
 And I think what we see happening in this passage about the rebuilding of the second

288
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,300
 temple has so much to say about how the Spirit wants to rebuild us.

289
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,660
 So I want to read you this passage that we're going to be digging into over these four weeks

290
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
 together.

291
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,060
 And then we're just going to look at the first couple of verses here this afternoon.

292
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,060
 Is this okay, everyone?

293
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,060
 You're right?

294
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,060
 All right.

295
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,980
 Ezra 3, starting in verse 10.

296
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,860
 When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, the priests in their vestments

297
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,860
 and with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Aspha, with cymbals, took their places

298
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,620
 to praise the Lord as prescribed by David, king of Israel.

299
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,460
 With praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the Lord, "He is good.

300
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,620
 His love to Israel endures forever."

301
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,320
 And all of the people gave a great shout of praise to the Lord, because the foundation

302
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,120
 of the house of the Lord was laid.

303
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,700
 But many of the others who had seen the former temple wept out loud when they saw the foundation

304
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,860
 of this temple being laid.

305
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,800
 While many others shouted for joy, no one could distinguish the sound of the shouts

306
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:18,620
 of joy from the sound of weeping, because the people made so much noise and the sound

307
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,600
 was heard from far away.

308
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,540
 When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for

309
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,180
 the Lord, the God of Israel, they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the family

310
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,420
 and they said, "Let us help you build, because like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing

311
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,780
 to him since the time of Esheron, king of Assyria, who brought us here."

312
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,940
 But Zerubbabel, and I think you could insert here, filled with the passion of the Holy

313
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,380
 Spirit, Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the family of Israel answered him this, "You

314
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,940
 have no part with us in building a temple to our God.

315
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,500
 We alone will build it, for the Lord, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of

316
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,700
 Persia, has commanded us."

317
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:09,020
 And the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to

318
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,020
 go on building.

319
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,300
 They hired counselors to work against them and frustrated their plans during the entire

320
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:20,700
 reign of Cyrus, king of Persia, down to the reign of Darius, king of Persia.

321
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,860
 Father, as we open up this passage over the next four weeks, I want to pray that you would

322
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,300
 bring something alive within each person here.

323
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,180
 I want to pray that you would do some rebuilding, Lord.

324
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,460
 And I want to pray that people here would feel like they're becoming more the person

325
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,040
 that you've designed them to be.

326
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,060
 And I want to pray for the wind of the Spirit, with faith and courage, to rise up here at

327
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,280
 the vine.

328
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,980
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

329
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,820
 Let me read the first part of the first verse again.

330
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,260
 "When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord."

331
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,580
 Ezra begins this amazing moment in Israel's history by simply saying, "We're standing

332
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,540
 there in the rubble, in the ruins."

333
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,620
 And the builders come out and they begin the work of laying the foundations right where

334
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,300
 we were standing in the rubble.

335
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:14,980
 I love how the fact that Ezra doesn't try to paint a prettier picture than the reality

336
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,260
 of what it was.

337
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,700
 Jerusalem in those days was a desolate place.

338
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,020
 It used to be one of the most beautiful cities in all of the world.

339
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,860
 And at this point, it literally lay in ruins.

340
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,860
 We don't see a full picture of that in Ezra 3, but you can go to other books like Nehemiah

341
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,500
 that shows us the same moment and look at how they describe it.

342
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,940
 So let me show you Nehemiah chapter 4, starting in verse 2.

343
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,860
 It says, "In the presence of his associates in the army of Samaria, he said, 'What are

344
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,260
 these feeble Jews doing?

345
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,060
 Will they restore their wall?

346
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,860
 Will they offer sacrifices in the temple?

347
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,660
 Will they finish in a day?

348
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:59,620
 Can they bring the stones back to life from these heaps of rubble, burned as they are?'"

349
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,940
 Have you ever had anybody in your life where you're kind of thinking, "Man, I can't wait

350
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
 for the future.

351
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,220
 I'm excited about what's ahead."

352
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,660
 And they're like the naysayer that's around you saying, "Really?

353
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,260
 You really think that's going to happen to you?

354
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,340
 That's not going to happen to you."

355
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,260
 Anybody had anybody like that in their lives?

356
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,540
 Yeah, okay.

357
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,460
 Either you have or you're lying.

358
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,860
 But the reality is we all have those people, right?

359
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,980
 When we say, "Hey, you know, I want to step out, entrepreneur.

360
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,140
 I'm going to start my own business."

361
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,460
 Oh, really?

362
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,260
 Have you seen the last business you ran?

363
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,780
 Do you see how terrible you are running businesses?

364
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
 So here's Ezra and Nehemiah.

365
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,340
 They're going to rebuild the wall.

366
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,500
 They're going to rebuild the temple.

367
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,740
 And here's all the naysayers around them, the enemies of God's people, and they're taunting

368
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,740
 them.

369
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,860
 And they're saying, "Have you seen the stones?

370
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,600
 Have you seen the rubble?

371
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,660
 Have you seen how burnt it is?

372
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:54,220
 I mean, there is nothing good that could ever come from this rubble."

373
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,780
 That's the taunts that are coming against God's people as they're planning to rebuild.

374
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,980
 And I love the fact that Nehemiah and Ezra do not shirk from that.

375
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
 They do not hide it.

376
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,420
 They put it right out there for thousands of years for people to read.

377
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,700
 Yeah, it was bad, they're saying.

378
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,340
 I mean, literally those stones were burnt up and thrown aside.

379
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,180
 What the Babylonians had did to our wall and did to our temple.

380
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,460
 I mean, it's disgusting.

381
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,580
 I mean, it was an absolute shambles.

382
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,940
 They're not trying to sweep it under the rug.

383
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,260
 They're not trying to pretend like things aren't good.

384
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,980
 They're not trying to like kind of, you know, put a wool over our eyes.

385
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,600
 They're actually saying, "No, it was really bad.

386
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,460
 We used to have this glorious temple, and now it was like the stones were all burnt

387
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,420
 and ruined and desolate."

388
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:44,540
 Nehemiah and Ezra want you to see how bad things are because they know that that's the

389
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,700
 starting place from which God is going to do something.

390
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,860
 They know that God's going to get even more glory in the future if you can understand

391
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,100
 just how terrible it is to begin.

392
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:02,900
 And you need to understand, any journey in personal transformation will not happen unless

393
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,440
 you recognize in your life what needs to change.

394
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,360
 You will resist the Spirit's work in transforming you if you're constantly sweeping under the

395
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,940
 rug all of the ugliness within your life.

396
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,700
 If you're constantly trying to pretend to everybody and come into church on a Sunday,

397
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
 "Hey, praise Jesus.

398
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,700
 Everything's great," when you know that there are stuff lying in ruins within you and rubble

399
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:35,420
 around you, the starting point of every transformation is the honesty and the sober reflection, "There's

400
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,060
 rubble within me."

401
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:46,340
 A holy dissatisfaction that there is some stuff that's laying in ruins inside of me

402
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,940
 and I'm tired of covering it up.

403
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,980
 Need to understand that you will never become the person that God longs you to be without

404
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:02,520
 first understanding and owning the person you are today.

405
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:08,500
 Without first understanding and owning the reality that there are some broken pieces,

406
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,240
 that there is some burnt out stones, that it's not looking the way that you were longing

407
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
 it to look.

408
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,300
 And just in the soberness and the honesty, it's saying, "I see it.

409
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,860
 I know it.

410
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,340
 I own it.

411
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:29,000
 I don't want it, but it starts here."

412
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,420
 And once we get ourselves to the point where we know where we begin, then here's the most

413
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,780
 important thing for you to hold on to.

414
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,820
 God's work of renewal always begins in the rubble.

415
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,460
 God's work of renewal always begins in that place of rubble.

416
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,740
 What's amazing to me is Ezra and Nehemiah, they're like, "Yeah, the place is really bad.

417
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,740
 Yes, the stones, they're burnt out."

418
00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:00,500
 But what they don't do is remove all the burnt out stones and then bring in stones from somewhere

419
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,340
 else to start the foundations of the temple.

420
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:09,300
 What they do is they take those burnt out stones and they begin to lay the foundation

421
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,860
 for the new temple.

422
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,900
 Something that causes the older people to weep, something that causes the young people

423
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
 to cheer.

424
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:20,080
 But notice this, they don't get rid of the old stones, they restore and reuse those stones

425
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,860
 in the new temple.

426
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,780
 And this is exactly what the Holy Spirit does in the personal transformation of us.

427
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:31,020
 When there's things that lie in ruin within you, that's not the area where the Lord says,

428
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,580
 "Ew, let's get rid of that."

429
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,820
 That's the area where He gets excited and says, "We're going to do something with that

430
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
 rubble."

431
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,700
 You see, the enemies are going, "Have you seen the stones?

432
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,300
 Nothing good can come of that."

433
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,540
 And some of you, you're in a season of your life where you see the rubble within you and

434
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,900
 that's what you're thinking too.

435
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,220
 You're like, "Man, there's this brokenness, there's this sin, there's this trauma, there's

436
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,540
 these mistakes I've made, there's this stuff that somebody else did to me that's really

437
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
 hurt me deeply.

438
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,420
 I mean, nothing good could ever come from that.

439
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,620
 Well, I guess I'm on plan B or plan C or plan F in my life."

440
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,740
 And the Lord stands over you and says, "Don't you realize that the rubble within you is

441
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,660
 my playground?

442
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:17,380
 Don't you realize that the rubble with inside of you is the very place where I do my greatest

443
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,380
 miracles?

444
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,780
 Don't you recognize that that's where I want to restore and renew you?

445
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,340
 It's not like I'm going to wipe that away and we're going to start afresh.

446
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:29,620
 I'm going to take the very things that the enemy has used for him and I'm going to restore

447
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,100
 the years that the locusts have eaten.

448
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:37,420
 I'm going to give back to you out of the very place of your greatest brokenness, your greatest

449
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,420
 future."

450
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,980
 You see, you need to understand that when the Lord sees the rubble of your life, he's

451
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,180
 not repulsed and repelled.

452
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,020
 He rejoices and rolls up his sleeves.

453
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,540
 He's like, "We're going to get going."

454
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,260
 He's like, "You want to see some personal transformation?

455
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,140
 Bring me that.

456
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,900
 Bring me the burnt out stones.

457
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,900
 Bring the worst ones and we're going to have a party.

458
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,020
 We're going to do something.

459
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
 We're going to move something.

460
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,540
 We're going to trans...

461
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,020
 I'm rolling my sleeves up.

462
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,640
 I'm excited for what's about to happen in your life."

463
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,460
 And so often we see the rubble and we think nothing good can come with this.

464
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,260
 We decide with the taunts of the enemy, "I don't think anything good can come for this."

465
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:27,340
 And God's like, "If you could only see through my eyes."

466
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,580
 See Ezra and Nehemiah, they realized they had a decision to make.

467
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,980
 They didn't shy away from the desolate place that they were standing in.

468
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,500
 They didn't try to ignore the reality of the burnt out stones, but they had a decision

469
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
 to make.

470
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,980
 Were they going to agree with the taunts of the enemy and say, "I don't think anything

471
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,660
 could ever happen with these stones."

472
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:56,420
 Or were they going to say, "This is the very place in which the Lord is going to begin."

473
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,420
 And I believe that all of us here are going to be faced with that decision.

474
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,840
 That's the starting point of a season of personal transformation.

475
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,060
 To recognize what it is that needs to be transformed, to be sober about it, to be honest about it,

476
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,480
 to recognize it, own it, see it.

477
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,580
 But then to decide, "You know what?

478
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,320
 Even though that rubble is telling me I'm never going to amount to anything, I'm going

479
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,380
 to trust and have faith and courage and I'm going to trust in the Lord that this is actually

480
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,300
 the place where He begins."

481
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:31,180
 See, what you currently see as the rubble of your past, the Lord sees as the building

482
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,380
 blocks of your future.

483
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,380
 Come on church.

484
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,300
 I know it's the afternoon on a Sunday, but come on.

485
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,300
 You guys okay?

486
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,740
 Too many dim sums for lunch?

487
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,740
 I mean that's serious preaching behind me right there.

488
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,740
 Come on.

489
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,660
 Like, this is it, right?

490
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,580
 What we see as the rubble of our past and we therefore will amount to nothing, God sees

491
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,860
 that and He says, "I'm going to make that the building block."

492
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:02,900
 Psalms say it this way, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone."

493
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,460
 The one that everybody threw away, the one that nobody thought anything good.

494
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,740
 How could anything good ever come from Nazareth was the cry.

495
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,500
 "I'm going to take the one thing that everybody's going to reject and that's going to be the

496
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,780
 thing that I'm going to build my whole kingdom on.

497
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,940
 That's going to be the thing that's going to be the cornerstone of every salvation in

498
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
 this world ever.

499
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,420
 I'm going to take what is rejected, hung on the cross, beaten, bled and killed and I'm

500
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,380
 going to raise it in three days time and it's going to have the fullness of life and the

501
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,660
 same spirit that did that will then be placed in you."

502
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,140
 And so you stand before the rubble of your life and you can either go, "Nothing great

503
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,300
 is ever going to happen now because of that."

504
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,700
 Or you can go, "It hurts.

505
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,460
 It's hard.

506
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,460
 There's trauma.

507
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
 It's difficult."

508
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:54,060
 I'm not downplaying the reality of the rubble but I have a decision to make.

509
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:59,660
 Either I align myself with the enemy and the conversation on death or I align myself in

510
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,940
 faith and courage with the Lord and the conversation of life.

511
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:12,940
 But me and my household, we choose life.

512
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,460
 The question is how do we do it?

513
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,740
 How do we actually make that shift?

514
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,300
 Because the trauma is difficult.

515
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,580
 The rubble is tough.

516
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,960
 The burnt out stones have a strong story.

517
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:32,580
 How do we even begin the process of personal transformation when the rubble seems so loud?

518
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,580
 Well notice what it says here in verses 10 and 11.

519
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,820
 "When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, the priests in their

520
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,340
 vestments with their trumpets, and the Levites, the son of Aspar with the symbols, took their

521
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,220
 place to praise the Lord as prescribed by David the king of Israel.

522
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,460
 With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the Lord, 'He is good.

523
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,060
 His love to Israel endures forever.'

524
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:58,100
 And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the Lord because the foundations of the

525
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,060
 house of the Lord was laid."

526
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,100
 I do not understand this part.

527
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,180
 Follow with me.

528
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:10,560
 Here's the people with their feet in the ruins of the old temple, set in the rubble of those

529
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:17,460
 burnt out stones, knowing and seeing the long journey ahead, wondering if Jerusalem could

530
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,860
 ever be the place that it used to be.

531
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,300
 And here's what they're doing.

532
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,700
 They're wallowing in self-pity.

533
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,140
 No, that's not what they're doing.

534
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,380
 Here's what they're doing.

535
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,780
 They're shouting praise.

536
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,900
 They're getting symbols and smashing them together.

537
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,020
 You can imagine there were drums going.

538
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,740
 There were shouts of praise from all the people.

539
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,020
 "Worthy is He.

540
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,340
 Hallelujah to Him."

541
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:45,140
 They're having a massive dance-off worship party whilst the builders are laying the first

542
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,060
 stones of the new building of the temple.

543
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,020
 There's a praise party going on in the rubble.

544
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,400
 I don't know about you, but that doesn't make any sense to me.

545
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,260
 Because when I'm aware of the rubble and what's been broken down in my life, the last thing

546
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,460
 I want is someone smashing symbols around me.

547
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,340
 The last thing I want is somebody singing some happy praise song.

548
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,060
 The last thing I want is some cheesy Christian bumper slicker slapped on my face.

549
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:17,860
 The last thing I want is someone to say, "Hallelujah, praise Jesus," when I'm wallowing in my rubble.

550
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,940
 In fact, when I'm aware of the brokenness and everything, here's what I naturally want

551
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,940
 to do.

552
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,580
 I want to run away from the world.

553
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,300
 I want to run away from Christians.

554
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,700
 I want to hide in a cave and escape it all.

555
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:35,700
 My natural tendency when the rubble is speaking loud is not to praise Jesus.

556
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,260
 It is to turn away.

557
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,460
 But Israel, right at the start, have decided to start praising the Lord.

558
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,660
 Because they understand that the only way the rubble is going to get transformed is

559
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:51,860
 if they make space for the Spirit of God to come.

560
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,820
 And the only way they can make space for the Spirit of God to fall is by praising the burnt

561
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,820
 stone.

562
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,820
 Well, they're not praising the stone.

563
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,820
 They're praising Him.

564
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,020
 But they're praising Him in the burnt stones.

565
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,700
 Are you with me?

566
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,420
 They're praising Him, giving Him glory, and they're worshiping Him amongst the stones

567
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,940
 that are burnt, not knowing what's going to happen, but making a decision.

568
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:15,260
 If we don't praise Him at the beginning, we shouldn't praise Him at the end.

569
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,260
 Come on.

570
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,540
 Like, I think we get this so wrong as Christians.

571
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:24,660
 So often our praise is founded at the end when God's done something great.

572
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,380
 Let me tell you, it's easy to worship Jesus when your prayer's answered.

573
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,380
 Come on.

574
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,420
 It's easy to worship Jesus when everything falls into place, when the prayer gets answered,

575
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,460
 when the miracle happens, when the healing takes place.

576
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:43,300
 Of course we say hallelujah when God has done something incredible for us, and we should.

577
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,560
 That is worship.

578
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,700
 You should when your prayer is answered, when that job comes through, when the miracle takes

579
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,700
 place.

580
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,380
 Of course you should praise and honor and worship Him.

581
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,660
 That's absolutely right.

582
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:57,780
 But the majority of the worship that happens in church happens because people have had

583
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,620
 an outcome they were liked in God.

584
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,660
 I liked what God did, therefore I praise.

585
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:11,540
 Which means when we don't like what God did, guess what happens to our praise?

586
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,580
 What happens is that our praise becomes like a wish list of all of our prayer requests

587
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,580
 put to music.

588
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,340
 Have you ever found yourself drawn to the worship songs that tell God exactly what you

589
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,620
 want Him to do for you?

590
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:29,940
 Those are the songs that we like to sing as the ones that actually tell God what to do.

591
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,860
 Here's Israel and they're praising God in the middle of this moment.

592
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,220
 And they're making this decision because they're creating space for it.

593
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,700
 And we so often praise God at the end, praise God because of an outcome.

594
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:49,300
 Israel is praising God at the start before any prayer is answered, before any temple

595
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,420
 is built, before anything that happens.

596
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,180
 They have no idea what's going to take place.

597
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,740
 They don't know if the temple is going to be as beautiful as the old one.

598
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,420
 They don't know if the city is going to look as grand and as great as the old one, but

599
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,580
 that doesn't matter to them.

600
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:06,260
 They're saying the only way this is happening is if we praise at the beginning, not just

601
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,340
 praising at the end.

602
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,420
 That's a dangerous kind of worship.

603
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,020
 My friends, that's worship that's a weapon.

604
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,900
 Most of the worship that we do, like I say, is coming at the end.

605
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,340
 The worship that really is a weapon, that really shifts stuff, is not a worship that

606
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,620
 comes at the end that's retrospective.

607
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,940
 It's the worship that happens at the beginning that's prophetic.

608
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:37,420
 The worship that is not reactive to something, but the worship that is proactively calling

609
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:41,780
 in the kingdom of God to do something in a dry and desolate land.

610
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,580
 That worship moves the hand of God.

611
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:49,020
 That's the kind of worship that actually tears down the walls of Jericho and moves those

612
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,100
 bricks to rubble and then takes the rubble in Jerusalem and creates another glorious

613
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,060
 city.

614
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,100
 That's that kind of worship.

615
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,220
 That's the kind of worship that I think the Lord wants to release here at the Vine.

616
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,940
 I think we have much of that kind of worship.

617
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,660
 I think one of the things I'm so enjoyed about here in our community, that I do believe we

618
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:13,300
 do worship at the beginning, but your personal transformation journey will only start when

619
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,760
 you shift your worship away from being retrospective to being prophetic.

620
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,880
 Away from looking back to looking forward.

621
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,860
 That's the key to the start of your personal transformation journey.

622
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:30,260
 And I want you to see, because this is so powerful, I want you to see the content of

623
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,260
 Israel's worship.

624
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,100
 Not only are they worshipping at the start, but the question we should ask is, what are

625
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
 they worshipping?

626
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
 Listen to this.

627
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:42,820
 They say, "He is good, his love to Israel endures forever."

628
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,300
 I love this because this is not the worship that I would have brought in that moment.

629
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:52,180
 If I was Ezra and Zerubbabel and the family head elders of Israel and we're standing in

630
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,540
 the rubble, our worship would probably sound a little bit more, if I was leading, it would

631
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,060
 probably sound a little bit more like this, "Lord, we worship you today because you're

632
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,620
 going to build a glorious temple.

633
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,300
 We worship you today because you're going to make Israel's name great in all the nations

634
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,300
 again.

635
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,420
 We worship you today because you're going to make Jerusalem an incredible city."

636
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:16,860
 In other words, my worship would be based on some sort of circumstance that I'm hoping

637
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,220
 that the Lord will bring.

638
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,620
 So often our worship is based on a circumstance we're looking for.

639
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:28,140
 Israel, they start the journey not by saying, "God, would you come and do this for our temple?"

640
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,620
 They start simply by this, "This is how I worship you.

641
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,780
 Not on some circumstance that I want, but on a God that I know.

642
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,260
 He is good."

643
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:42,740
 In other words, I'm going to focus on character over circumstance, over the nature of God

644
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,820
 than the narrative of the world.

645
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,420
 And sure, I see those burnt out stones and I see the rubble and I'm not shy from it.

646
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,260
 I'm honest about it and I'm sober about it.

647
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,940
 I realize our starting point.

648
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,660
 But that starting point is not asking God to do something that I want Him to do.

649
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:00,880
 I'm just literally saying, "Because He is good, I can put my trust in Him.

650
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,260
 Because He is good in a season of uncharted personal transformation, I can trust that

651
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,180
 whatever happens is going to be in His will and ultimately is going to be good, even if

652
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,860
 it's not what I want.

653
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:18,620
 If I can say He is good, everything around me changes in light of that declaration."

654
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:25,260
 Church, you have to understand that in the Christian life, the journey of personal transformation

655
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:30,060
 begins not with a shift in circumstance, but with a shift in perspective.

656
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,780
 Not your perspective about the world, but the perspective about God.

657
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:37,940
 See, as soon as you start thinking about Him differently, everything else begins to fall

658
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,940
 in place.

659
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:46,660
 When our divine perspective shifts, your temporal reality will be reframed.

660
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,900
 I'm not saying the circumstance is suddenly going to be how you want it to be.

661
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,340
 I'm not saying that you're suddenly going to get all the things that you've been praying

662
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,340
 and asking for.

663
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,820
 What I'm saying is when you understand that He is good, you will look at your circumstance,

664
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,780
 no matter whether it's good or bad, differently.

665
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:07,020
 Your temporal reality will be reframed out of the declaration that He is good.

666
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:12,780
 In other words, when I'm trying to change and be more like Christ Jesus, if I start

667
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,620
 with my circumstance, "Oh, I'm just going to change me.

668
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,380
 I might change a little bit, but I'm going to fall back again."

669
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:26,560
 Whereas instead, if I change in how I see God, He is good, He is mighty, He is powerful,

670
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,680
 He is faithful, He never gives up on His promises.

671
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,660
 When I declare His nature, it begins to reframe the way in which I see the here and now.

672
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:43,500
 And those rubbles can come to life because He's good.

673
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,500
 You see, I don't know if He's going to heal me of these insecurities that I've battled

674
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:55,380
 with for many years in my life, but I do know that He is good.

675
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,940
 I don't know if He's going to answer the prayers that I've been praying for many different

676
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:04,660
 areas of my life the way I want Him to answer them, but I do know He is good.

677
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,460
 I don't know if He's going to heal your cancer, but I do know He is good.

678
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,740
 I don't know if He's suddenly going to change and magically restore your marriage, but I

679
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,500
 do know that He is good.

680
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,840
 I don't know if He's going to provide that job you need or that spouse you want or whatever

681
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,300
 it might be, but I do know He is good.

682
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:25,100
 And when we know that He is good, everything else around us begins to take on a new way

683
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,100
 of looking.

684
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:31,900
 And we stand in the rubble and we see that it's burnt out, but because He is good and

685
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,780
 our starting place is worship, not because of what's going to happen, but simply because

686
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:45,180
 of His nature and His character, we suddenly find ourselves believing that the future is

687
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,220
 going to be better than the past.

688
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:55,140
 That's the burden, this holy dissatisfaction in what currently is and this longing for

689
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:00,800
 what could be abundantly more, because He is good.

690
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:07,980
 So it begins recognizing the rubble, not sweeping it under the carpet, confessing it, owning

691
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,300
 it, seeing it, sharing it with those around you if you're called to do that, bringing

692
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,200
 it to Him.

693
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,460
 It then begins understanding that God's greatest work is done in the rubble, that it's His

694
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,460
 playground.

695
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,660
 He rolls up His sleeves and gets excited and digs in.

696
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:25,580
 And then because of that, we start in worship.

697
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:30,220
 We start in declaring that He is good no matter what might happen, no matter how long it might

698
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,960
 take, no matter what transformation might be there, but we say He is good.

699
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,900
 And that reframes the way we see the rubble, it reframes the way we see ourselves, it reframes

700
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,160
 everything around us.

701
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,180
 It doesn't naturally make everything perfect, but it does enable us to have the faith and

702
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,340
 the courage to begin.

703
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,740
 It would end up taking 20 years for the temple to be rebuilt.

704
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:58,500
 Listen to this, most of the eternally significant things that the Lord wants to do in your life

705
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,620
 will not be done in a moment or a single day.

706
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:08,420
 Most of the most underlying, worthy and valuable things that the Lord will do in your life

707
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:14,820
 will happen when you on a faithful, obedient level, just every day do a small, maybe even

708
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:20,420
 sent feeling to you mundane little thing where you're obedient to Him and you move a rubble

709
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:25,260
 maybe two inches this way and then move another piece two inches that way.

710
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,980
 And then over a long period of time, suddenly 20 years later, you are not the person you

711
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,880
 used to be.

712
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:41,100
 It starts in the rubble, it starts with praise and it starts with reframing everything around

713
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,460
 us because He is good and His love endures forever.

714
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,460
 Amen.

715
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:50,700
 Can we stand together?

716
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:56,500
 I would love to pray for you and pray over you and in you and through you and all the

717
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,620
 other things that we can do in prayer.

718
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,940
 Father just, we are so, so grateful.

719
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,900
 Lord, we want to thank you for the start of this series and these next four weeks that

720
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,140
 are on your heart for the people in this room.

721
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:17,740
 Thank you that each person here has some area of their life that you want to restore, rebuild

722
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,780
 and renew.

723
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:28,180
 I want to just pray pastorally first of all just for anyone in this room where the rubble

724
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,220
 is really difficult right now.

725
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,460
 You know, just like Ezra and Nehemiah, we do not play down the rubble.

726
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:41,200
 For some of you, you are in a really difficult time.

727
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,300
 Maybe some of you in this room, you really are struggling with trauma.

728
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,100
 You are struggling with some big issues that are not a quick and easy fix and it can feel

729
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:55,660
 overwhelming and painful and hurtful and perhaps you are not even sure if you are going to

730
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,020
 survive.

731
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,740
 We just want to pastorally as a church community pray over anyone in this room where that is

732
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:06,820
 their reality right now.

733
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:15,460
 The Lord will bring his strength to you, to hold you in a time of unprecedented struggle.

734
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,300
 So Lord, if there is anybody in this room where the rubble seems to be far too overwhelming

735
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:25,100
 right now, Lord we want to pray that just step one is that they would find you right

736
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,100
 now.

737
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:31,380
 That they would feel you strengthening them and holding them, walking with them.

738
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:37,300
 Father, I want to pray for these people in the room that need to make a decision today.

739
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,340
 I feel like this is important for this service, maybe more than the others.

740
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,420
 There's some of you here that it's a long time since you've done this, but you need

741
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,860
 to make a decision.

742
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,900
 Are you going to listen to the taunts of the enemy, take a look at the rubble in your life

743
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,260
 and say, "Well, I guess nothing ever good is going to come from that."

744
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:01,100
 Or are you going to draw a line in the sand and in faith and courage say, "I believe

745
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:06,660
 that the Lord can renew from the burnt out stones something glorious and great."

746
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,260
 Some of you in the stream, you need to make a decision here today that you're not going

747
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:16,780
 to allow the voice of the rubble to be louder to you than the voice of the Spirit.

748
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:20,340
 And so it's standing strong today and saying, "I'm making that decision.

749
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,340
 I'm going to choose life.

750
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,180
 I don't know how it's going to work out.

751
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,220
 I don't know exactly what the Lord's going to do.

752
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,000
 It's uncharted.

753
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,200
 But I will trust in Him and I will believe that the Spirit's bringing of life is greater

754
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,800
 than the rubble's voice of death."

755
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:41,040
 Some of you need to make that decision here this afternoon in response.

756
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:46,840
 And finally, perhaps for some of you, worship needs to shift in your life.

757
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,240
 Maybe you recognize that worship often is an outcome for you.

758
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,480
 It often is only a response to what the Lord has done.

759
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,680
 What would it look like for you to start worshiping at the beginning?

760
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,920
 What would it look like for you to shift your worship away from a circumstantial change

761
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,520
 to a declaration of the nature of God?

762
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:14,520
 What would it look like for you to get a fresh divine perspective that could change your

763
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,520
 temporal framing of your situation right now?

764
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,920
 So for some of you, it's a shift in how you worship, a shift in the way you think about

765
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:30,200
 worship from retroactive to proactive, from retrospective to prophetic, to saying right

766
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:36,400
 here and right now, even in the rubble, "Long before I have seen an answer, I have seen

767
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,640
 an outcome.

768
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:42,360
 I will praise Him for He is good.

769
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,040
 His love endures forever."

770
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,200
 So Lord, as we worship you now, would you just come for those that need your touch and

771
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:55,080
 your strength pastorally, would you come for those that need to make a decision, would

772
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,320
 you enable them to do so in their heart?

773
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:01,400
 For those that want to shift their worship, would you release, Lord, a fresh voice and

774
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,720
 a fresh sound from each life and each person to be able to worship you as you've always

775
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,720
 mean it?

776
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,720
 We just thank you for this.

777
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:08,720
 In Jesus' name.

778
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,220
 Amen.

779
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,200
 In Jesus' name.

780
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,700
 Amen.
