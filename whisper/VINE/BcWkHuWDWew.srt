1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
 I am neither an extrovert or introvert, I'm kind of like a coffee-fert.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,880
 So before coffee, I'm like a cat, but she can do that whenever.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,080
 And the conferences, both conferences that you mentioned, sounds amazing.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,160
 I'd love to sign up.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,160
 Thank you.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
 Yes.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,760
 Right, so I, first of all, like in today's prayer meeting, we came up with this phrase

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,600
 that, oh, we're here as a family.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,340
 It was mentioned a few times in the prayer meeting before both services, and it was also

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,800
 mentioned when we led the Cantonese service as well.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,640
 And I remember, wow, family, that's a really good term to, you know, describe how we are

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,040
 all together.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,880
 And as a family, I just want to share something with you that is a little bit embarrassing.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,280
 Okay, I don't know if you've experienced this kind of embarrassment at home before, it's

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,720
 when you have to take out the trash.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,200
 Whenever you take out the trash, you don't wear your outfit, you just wear your pajamas,

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
 right?

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,880
 You wear pajamas, you put your, in a messy bun, and you don't fully wear your shoes.

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,280
 You tiptoe in your shoes, and then you just take out your trash and you walk out of the

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,040
 door and then right as you do it, the door slams behind you.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,680
 And you're left with pajamas and a messy bun and two bags of trash.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,680
 And have any one of you been in that position?

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,920
 I haven't, I just want to say I haven't, but then there's a hand raised up.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,920
 I haven't, I always take my, you have too?

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
 Oh, that's beautiful.

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,080
 I want to see you in a messy bun as well.

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,440
 And it was kind of like an embarrassing moment with locked doors and I can't, and sometimes

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,760
 door just close when you're not expected to, right?

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,820
 But then there are moments when I close the door on my own.

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,040
 So I remember a few years ago, I was serving at K4C in Wan Chai.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,620
 So they have this annual party for K4C volunteers, and they send out the email, they invite everyone.

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,560
 And at that time I was, you know, in a big church and I was a tiny person.

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,880
 I go, Oh, I need to make some friends.

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,200
 So I go in and I, I try to go to the party.

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,120
 So after the service, I plucked up my courage.

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,320
 I walked to the mini hall, I opened the door and it was so lively.

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
 Everyone was so friendly.

38
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,000
 And so I closed the door behind me and I just left.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,480
 I couldn't, I couldn't go and go into a room where there are so many people.

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,080
 The atmosphere is so warm.

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,760
 I need people that are like quiet and not talk and let me just slip in without noticing.

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,920
 And so I closed the door behind me.

43
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,680
 And I feel like if I have to make, put a metaphor to describe what relationships are like, I

44
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,720
 would use the door.

45
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
 I would use the door.

46
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,160
 You know, sometimes how you would close a relationship and just close the door.

47
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,160
 And sometimes you want to open a relationship.

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,520
 But then have you ever put yourself in a situation where you're met with locked doors?

49
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,120
 Like you try to open it, but it's locked.

50
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,920
 You try to talk to that family member, but it's not responding.

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,840
 You feel like, Oh, I need to, I want to text that person, but go, Oh no, I shouldn't.

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,220
 I haven't talked to that person for a long time.

53
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,200
 And it's Christmas and everyone is gathering, but that person is not there anymore.

54
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,240
 Or maybe it's a friend that there will be so many misunderstanding or conflict between

55
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
 you two.

56
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,920
 He just stopped reaching out.

57
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,280
 Perhaps you've been betrayed or hurt by them.

58
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,680
 And so you had to freeze that relationship and set it aside while you heal yourself.

59
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,000
 And maybe the door is locked between you and your partner.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,900
 You might still eat with each other and you have conversation about daily necessities

61
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,760
 and things like that.

62
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,920
 But you know that the relationship is locked and you rarely let each other understand your

63
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,960
 thoughts and feelings anymore.

64
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,960
 It's a, in a temporary state of suspension.

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,960
 But some relationships aren't just locked.

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,880
 It's kind of dead.

67
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,200
 It's like a, when it's a locked situation, you can still find a key and you open it and

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,920
 you create that channel of communication again.

69
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:16,000
 But when you're in a dead relationship, you can't really seem to move on in that relationship.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,240
 When a relationship dies, it's the trust between the two people is gone.

71
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,000
 And you sat and you think about it and you go, what happened?

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,840
 How did I get there?

73
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,200
 A minute ago, I was still talking to that person.

74
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,040
 I was still having jokes and we were in each other's lives.

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,680
 But then suddenly, suddenly, it seems like it happened so quickly that this relationship

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,320
 is gone.

77
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,680
 And I've read some books to describe how relationship end up in that situation.

78
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,600
 Maybe maybe it's because of fear.

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,880
 There are lots of fear in relationships.

80
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,360
 Fear of rejections.

81
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,720
 Like you you were left unread with two blue takes and it was never got back to you.

82
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,240
 Or maybe we fear the conflict that we might have.

83
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,720
 Well, there are conflicts in all situations and in all relationships.

84
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,640
 But the fear of conflict just made me wonder, I don't want to reach out to that person anymore.

85
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,040
 I don't want to be with this person anymore.

86
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,520
 And maybe we're fear of the emotional outburst that might come.

87
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,680
 Can I handle when the other person have an emotional outburst?

88
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,400
 And what if I have big emotions that I couldn't handle?

89
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,960
 What if there are accusations between the both of us?

90
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,220
 And because of the fear of conflict, of accusations and everything, it worsened into isolation.

91
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,280
 We might stop sending messages to each other and avoid attending events that we might both

92
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
 be in.

93
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,680
 And we tell ourselves that if I don't see that person, if I don't reach out, it's okay.

94
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,760
 You know, a service level piece will be there.

95
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,880
 But this piece just stop us from communicating with each other.

96
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,600
 And with this mixture of fear and isolation and suspicious, it becomes a vicious cycle

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,400
 where every little detail becomes a trigger point for you.

98
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,040
 Like you see this person's phone face down and you go, is he lying to me again?

99
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,600
 Was she lying to me again?

100
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,540
 We see that that person is just chatting so happily with the other person.

101
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,200
 And you think about why is she so cold to me?

102
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,800
 And all of that just became a vicious cycle.

103
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:37,000
 And we store, or I store, all the wounds in my heart and let it ferment.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,880
 And it was not even about forgiveness anymore.

105
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:47,480
 It's about how I process my feelings and my doubts and my hurt and how do I, you know,

106
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,160
 move forward.

107
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:57,160
 When relationships end between one person, it never just stopped affecting that relationship.

108
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,800
 Oftentimes it affects how I feel about myself or how I treat or how I see other parts of

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
 my relationship.

110
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
 And things like this might happen.

111
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,600
 You might hear yourself saying, if I can't even handle my relationship with my parents,

112
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,120
 how can I cherish those around me?

113
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,720
 If even the closest people hurt me, it's hard to trust others again.

114
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,240
 If relationships are this fragile, I better be more careful.

115
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,920
 And all these things accumulated and it fermented.

116
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,960
 And so I might have a problem with one of my friends, but then it turned out that myself,

117
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,640
 my worth, and how I see myself with other people are actually getting fractures.

118
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,840
 And so this affects not just how we see that specific failed relationship, it shapes how

119
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,480
 I approach all relationships.

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:02,300
 I was listening and watching the Joseph series and it just came to me that I go, I'm not

121
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,040
 angry with anyone, but I am fearful.

122
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,400
 I don't know how to move on with a particular relationship, not because I'm angry, but I'm

123
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,600
 so scared that I don't know how to react or respond to that person anymore.

124
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:24,120
 And so after that series, I had a little retreat for myself and I walked in the wetland park

125
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:33,260
 and I began to think about, I asked God, actually, I asked God, why is relationship so difficult?

126
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:40,320
 My relationship with God is fine, but why is the relationship between me and other people

127
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,200
 so difficult?

128
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,920
 And I seem to hear God telling me that he gave me an image of broken glasses and he

129
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,960
 said, when you use the broken glasses to look at the world, how can your world appear whole?

130
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:06,000
 If you see things out of a broken lens, how can your world be complete and in the right

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,480
 proportion?

132
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,720
 When your perspective is already broken and distorted, how can you see your own flaws

133
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,840
 and sin from the right proportion?

134
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,240
 And this is a powerful image, just as broken glasses distort everything we see, our past

135
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,720
 hurt and fears can distort how we view all our relationships.

136
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,500
 We might see potential betrayals when there is none.

137
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:39,860
 We might interpret neutral actions as hostile or expect the worst from people because that's

138
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,760
 what our broken lenses show us.

139
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,440
 In this series, we are talking about resurrection hope.

140
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,920
 Last week, we discussed the resurrection of the body and Pastor Chapman talked about how

141
00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:00,160
 Jesus' resurrection means sin was defeated and death's power is no longer the final story.

142
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,640
 And what Jesus can resurrect isn't just our bodies, but also our relationship.

143
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:14,520
 This resurrected Jesus doesn't just leave the tomb, he enters into our locked rooms,

144
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,880
 resurrecting relationships we've sealed off with fear and failure.

145
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,960
 And today we're looking at scriptures from John 20, the scene where Jesus appears to

146
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,680
 his disciples.

147
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,900
 In verse 19 it says, "On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples

148
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:39,920
 were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders."

149
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,080
 At this point, Jesus has already risen.

150
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,480
 At this point, the woman has already gone to the tomb, saw the empty grave, ran back

151
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,300
 to tell Peter and John, and Peter and John ran to the tomb and they saw the empty tomb.

152
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,520
 They know that Jesus has risen.

153
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,680
 But what did they do?

154
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,880
 They ran back to the room and locked themselves in for fear of the Jewish leaders.

155
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,840
 And I wonder if you can imagine what are some of the other emotions that might be in the

156
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:18,780
 disciples' heart or mind.

157
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,640
 Could anyone guess disappointment?

158
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,560
 What were they disappointed about?

159
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,520
 They were likely to be disappointed about themselves.

160
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,240
 Some of, some, if you remember who has boldly said, "If I have to die with you, I will

161
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,080
 never disown you.

162
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,840
 Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you."

163
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:45,800
 But that person denied Jesus three times before the crow, before the rooster crow, and probably

164
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:52,020
 also faced identity crisis as their own identity comes from following Jesus.

165
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,180
 Most disciples have left everything behind.

166
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,520
 They left their livelihood behind, they left their families behind to follow Jesus.

167
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,060
 Being the follower of Jesus is their identity.

168
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:09,340
 But they're scattered when Jesus went to the cross.

169
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,900
 And now with Jesus risen, who are they anymore?

170
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,860
 Can they still call themselves the follower of Jesus?

171
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,580
 They might feel unworthy.

172
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:27,300
 Many theologians pointed out that disciples probably felt unworthy of the good news of

173
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,740
 the resurrection because they had completely failed.

174
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,580
 How could they face the risen Lord?

175
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,500
 The sense of shame made them prefer to hide.

176
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,300
 Fear, guilt, and shame made them hide themselves.

177
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:52,380
 Just like us, when we face with dead relationships, we have the same feelings as well.

178
00:12:52,380 --> 00:13:02,220
 And at that moment, as the disciples hide behind locked doors, verse 19 continues, "Jesus

179
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,660
 came and stood among them and said, 'Peace be with you.'"

180
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,600
 Jesus didn't wait outside.

181
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,580
 He didn't demand the disciples to be brave and open the doors, "It's me, Jesus.

182
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,300
 You need to step out of your comfort zone."

183
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,820
 He didn't say that, but he directly entered that closed space, entering their most vulnerable

184
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,960
 situation.

185
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,660
 And what's more touching is that his first word wasn't accusations like, "Why did you

186
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,660
 run away?"

187
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,540
 Or questioning, "Where is your faith?"

188
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,000
 Or scold them to say, "Why are you so cowardly?"

189
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,300
 But instead, with deep acceptance, he said, "Peace be with you."

190
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,820
 And I connect with that so much.

191
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,820
 There were times when I have to go to spiritual healing sessions and prayer sessions, and

192
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,620
 the images that I have is often myself.

193
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,100
 I locked myself in a room with really heavy locks and doors.

194
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,180
 And that wasn't the first time I had that experience.

195
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:12,900
 Especially when I was young, whenever I feel frustrated or sad or angry, this is what I

196
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
 do.

197
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:20,420
 I lock myself in the bathroom and I just scream, an inaudible scream that I wouldn't let anyone

198
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,380
 know how I'm feeling.

199
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,660
 I wouldn't let people know that I'm frustrated or I'm sad.

200
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,020
 They don't know anything on the outside, but I locked myself in the bathroom.

201
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,380
 I cry, I scribble angrily.

202
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:39,180
 I just let my emotion out, but I would not let other people in.

203
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:47,460
 I wonder if Jesus was in that room with me at that time.

204
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,700
 Jesus didn't force the disciples to open the doors.

205
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:59,340
 He just directly entered in, saying that, "Peace be with you."

206
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,260
 This peace wasn't just a simple greeting.

207
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:09,780
 It was a direct response to the disciples' inner fear, a healing for their shame, a release

208
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,860
 from their confined space, and restoration of their broken spirit.

209
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:22,860
 This shows us that when we close ourselves off in fear, God doesn't knock with condemnation,

210
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,540
 but enters a situation bringing peace.

211
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:35,140
 He completely understands our weaknesses and why we need to lock ourselves in the door.

212
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,260
 This teaches us one important lesson.

213
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,020
 Resurrection.

214
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,380
 Resurrection hope doesn't wait for us to fix ourselves first.

215
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:51,260
 It begins the moment Jesus actively breaks through our walls of fear.

216
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,180
 It doesn't wait for us to fix ourselves.

217
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:59,940
 We don't have to do that, but it begins the moment that Jesus actively breaks in.

218
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,540
 I need to recognize my situation, that in the face of death, I cannot do anything.

219
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,980
 Why do I keep mentioning death in today's message?

220
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,820
 It's because if I feel like the door is just locked, I could still find the key to open

221
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,820
 in.

222
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,540
 If I think that my relationship with that person is just sickness, I could start to

223
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,940
 heal that sickness.

224
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,460
 Or if I think I am okay, I just feel a little off, I can help myself to feel better.

225
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,940
 But actually, I need to recognize that there is something dying in me.

226
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,900
 There's some death in me.

227
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,620
 There's nothing I can do in the face of death.

228
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,460
 And because of that, I cannot change myself.

229
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:51,220
 Jesus appearing in the locked room today tells us that He understands why we are hiding in

230
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,640
 locked rooms.

231
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,520
 He doesn't need us to be brave or outgoing to take the first step.

232
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:05,740
 When we cannot change ourselves, He's willing to enter into our hearts to bring us peace.

233
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,100
 And verse 20 continues.

234
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,220
 After He said this, He showed them His hands and side.

235
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,340
 The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.

236
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:23,520
 I believe that when Jesus on His journey to the cross, He has many injuries on His body.

237
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,300
 He was beaten and whipped by the soldiers.

238
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,300
 He has a thorny crown on His head, dug deep inside His head.

239
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,140
 There were many scars and wounds on His body.

240
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,020
 His resurrection power could absolutely heal everything.

241
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:44,200
 But He deliberately withheld the wounds on His hands and His side.

242
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:51,420
 This wasn't just to prove that He was the crucified Jesus, not just to confirm to the

243
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:56,260
 disciples that everything really had happened, that He has resurrected.

244
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,380
 But this is the reason, showing them the wound on His hands, tells them that this is the

245
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,360
 reason why He came.

246
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,500
 He came not to condemn us, but He came to tell us that I died for your sin, for your

247
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,300
 shame and for your guilt.

248
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,820
 I have come here to show you my wounds.

249
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,100
 I've come here also to show you my pierced side, to tell you that there's resurrection

250
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,660
 in me as well.

251
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,720
 That whatever death you have in your body, in your mind, that you cannot fix yourself,

252
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,900
 I am here bringing the resurrection power to you.

253
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,840
 But in me there is life, in me there is hope, in me there is peace.

254
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,680
 When the disciples saw the scars, they were overjoyed.

255
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,900
 This joy came from an amazing discovery, that those once pierced hands now show forgiveness

256
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:52,440
 and acceptance, that those spear-pierced sides now spoke of resurrection power.

257
00:18:52,440 --> 00:19:00,280
 Those scars were no longer marks of death, but had become the sign of victory.

258
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,960
 These disciples had abandoned Jesus when He needed them most.

259
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,720
 Peter denied Him three times, but now the risen Lord appeared to them with these scars,

260
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,760
 offering not condemnation, but peace.

261
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,960
 And today, when we think of relationships we have locked away, or that have died, we

262
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,120
 don't need to live in endless self-condemnation, constantly beating ourselves up for not taking

263
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,600
 more steps, or feel guilty that, "Oh, the Bible tells us that I must forgive and I could

264
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
 not do that."

265
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,320
 No, we cannot do that.

266
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,080
 No, there are things that we can't do it on our own, but we need to accept that Jesus

267
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:46,560
 is now in our lives, bringing peace, bringing resurrection.

268
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,400
 What you cannot do becomes possible through Jesus' resurrection power.

269
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,560
 And when we truly understand this, we discover that restoring relationship doesn't start

270
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:06,280
 with what we can do, but with accepting what Jesus has already done for us.

271
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,540
 Restoring resolution doesn't start with, "I need to do now, I need to pray harder, I need

272
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,440
 to read the Bible more, I need to stop texting that person."

273
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,840
 No, actually, we need to accept that Jesus has brought healing in myself.

274
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,760
 Jesus is going to fix or mend or heal something that was once broken in myself.

275
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,700
 Broken relationship is not just about the relationship, it's about breaking something

276
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,320
 in your spirit as well.

277
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,400
 Whenever you meet with another person, that interaction did a little something in your

278
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,240
 life, and when the relationship is broken, you feel it in yourself.

279
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,560
 And so the healing doesn't just begin at the relationship, it begins in you.

280
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:57,840
 And by accepting what Jesus has done for you, restoration begins.

281
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,200
 It doesn't mean that our transgression doesn't matter or broken relationship doesn't need

282
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,600
 to be fixed, but rather we are filled with God's love and acceptance.

283
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,840
 When Jesus accepts sinful and limited me, I can finally remove the broken glasses and

284
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,680
 see myself clearly.

285
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,560
 We no longer rely on our strength to repair, but on the Lord who experienced the deepest

286
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,200
 brokenness and yet still choose to love.

287
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,680
 His resurrection power does not only heal and wipe our tears, but as we embrace the

288
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:41,320
 tears, as we embrace our little kids, that we are able to find that our life has been

289
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:47,080
 repaired and we can extend that to other people.

290
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:54,560
 When I was a teacher a few years ago, I was not a naggy person, but I became one because

291
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,520
 you know when all the clothes are on the floor and people say, "Oh, there's a funny story

292
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,120
 about clothes on the floor."

293
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,280
 So you know how lunchtime we need to bring curry?

294
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,760
 They have lunch, and there's one lunch they are having curry.

295
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,520
 And so this little kid, they brought the curry and they're so happy, "I'm having curry beef

296
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
 today."

297
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,720
 They walked over to the school bag and tripped and fell into the school bag.

298
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,040
 Well I haven't been a teacher and I understand that kids need to grow up and they need to

299
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,520
 start hanging their clothes.

300
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,520
 But I also learned that I can never nag a person to change.

301
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,920
 There's no amount of nagging that I can go and go, "You need to fix this.

302
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
 You need to improve.

303
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,280
 You need to do this and that."

304
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,740
 They can't do that.

305
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,220
 But what makes them change is that they feel that they're deeply loved.

306
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,880
 When the kids feel that they're so loved, they know that they're able to fail, but are

307
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
 still loved.

308
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,600
 When they're so loved, they know that I'm able to change, not because of the nagging,

309
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,640
 but because I'm loved and I want to show up for the person who loves me.

310
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,400
 When I'm so loved, I know that even if I fail, even if I have my limits, I am still loved.

311
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,840
 The love for me isn't depending on how well I do, but depend on that person who loves

312
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,560
 me regardless.

313
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,180
 And this is what Jesus is doing for the disciples in that locked room.

314
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,720
 He isn't telling them, "Oh, you're not following me good enough.

315
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
 You abandoned me.

316
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,320
 Now I don't love you anymore."

317
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,200
 No, He entered into the room telling them of His full acceptance and His full love for

318
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:32,220
 the disciples so that they can have the healing and courage to follow again.

319
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,600
 And today in our situation, maybe we feel like we have fallen short and we don't know

320
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,180
 how to pick ourselves up again.

321
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:49,940
 And today Jesus wants to show up in your room and tell you that, "I know that's why I come.

322
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,940
 I know we will fail.

323
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,780
 I know we have sins and limitations.

324
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,820
 That's why I come.

325
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:04,240
 Accept what I've done for you and let me love you so much that you know you can fail, but

326
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:12,180
 you can pick yourself back up again because I love you regardless."

327
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,200
 As mentioned earlier, the healing of our hearts in relationship isn't something we can achieve

328
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,340
 on our own, only in Jesus' resurrection power.

329
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:28,820
 And so in verse 22 to 23 it says, "And with that, Jesus breathed on them and said, 'Receive

330
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,880
 the Holy Spirit.

331
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,800
 If you forgive someone's sin, their sins are forgiven.

332
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,020
 If you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.'"

333
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,960
 If you've read Acts 2, you might wonder, is it too early in the story?

334
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,480
 Weren't they supposed to wait for, you know, everyone wait in the room and the whole Holy

335
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,820
 Spirit came onto them and this whole spirit filling up in the upper room story?

336
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:59,080
 But theologians point out that this was the preparatory giving, preparing them for what

337
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:06,880
 was going to come, especially for the mission of relationship, restoration, and forgiveness.

338
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:14,200
 As described in Ezekiel chapter 37, 9 to 10, God's spirit blows on dry bones, connecting

339
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:21,320
 those dry, broken, scattered bones, rebuilding to rebuild broken fellowship.

340
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,520
 It is not just an individual thing.

341
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:31,160
 When the Holy Spirit come and give you life in yourself, it's not just individual, but

342
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:38,720
 actually in community, bringing you life, giving you fresh life through the Holy Spirit.

343
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,320
 And Jesus continues, "If you forgive anyone's sin, their sins are forgiven."

344
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:52,860
 This isn't calling the disciples to be judges, but channels of forgiveness, channels of forgiveness.

345
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:59,800
 That means if you have experienced Jesus' forgiveness, then you're able to forgive others.

346
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,640
 So in the K4C room, the purpose is not to teach good kids.

347
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:12,240
 The purpose of the kids ministry is not to tell them to follow rules, but actually tell

348
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,800
 them about God's love, tell them about God's forgiveness.

349
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:21,000
 They experience it so that they're able to channel it to the people around them.

350
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,400
 K4C isn't a space for them to learn to good behavior.

351
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,080
 It is a space for them to connect to God.

352
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,740
 And so are we here.

353
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,340
 This is just a bigger K4C room, right?

354
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:38,120
 This is just us learning to be kids before God, learning how to receive this unconditional

355
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,780
 love, learning to receive forgiveness so that we can do what we've experienced.

356
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,860
 If you've never received forgiveness before, how do you know the weight that's been lifted

357
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,240
 off your shoulders?

358
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,680
 If you haven't understood how you have been, you know, how you've been understood your

359
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,360
 limits and your sin, how can you do that to other people?

360
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:05,180
 I still encourage you to try to think about it, but come to church and worship and sermon

361
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,700
 and fellowship.

362
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,720
 Let us learn to receive the love and the forgiveness and this acceptance so that when we go out

363
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,740
 of the room, that room, that world that you're in becomes the bigger K4C room that we're

364
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:24,660
 able to channel that forgiveness and that love to other people.

365
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,820
 And today I would like to encourage you to take practical steps towards this resurrection

366
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,640
 in our relationship.

367
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:38,140
 Just as Jesus entered that locked room gradually, first bringing peace, then showing his scars

368
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:44,200
 and then breathing his spirit, we too can take gradual steps.

369
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:53,820
 And that is not a list of things to do list, but I want you to this week, go to a room

370
00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:01,000
 and just think about and work with God, work with Jesus to show you the locked rooms that

371
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,100
 you're in.

372
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:09,380
 Maybe that relationship has locked you into a space where you felt shame and hurt.

373
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:15,200
 Maybe that relationship has locked you in a room where you condemn yourself of unforgiveness

374
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,220
 or other burdens.

375
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:24,980
 Talk to God, spend time with God to show you what locked relationship you might be in and

376
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:32,980
 then feel his presence in that relationship or in that hurt.

377
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:39,300
 You don't have to force yourself to do anything other than being aware that Jesus is with

378
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,740
 you in that room.

379
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,500
 He is with you.

380
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,820
 He is with you to bring you peace, to bring you healing.

381
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:57,140
 So before you go texting that person, before you go and ask that person out for a coffee,

382
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,180
 spend time with Jesus.

383
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,660
 Let him show you his scars.

384
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:12,060
 Let him show you his wounds on his side to let you experience that acceptance and the

385
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,740
 love that he has for you.

386
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:21,380
 And certainly when you're ready, take small acts of faith guided by the Holy Spirit for

387
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,380
 some relationship.

388
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,460
 It could be a simple message that I've been thinking of you or for others, it might be

389
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:33,340
 writing a longer letter or ask them to go out for a coffee.

390
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,420
 However, I do need to add this important note.

391
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:41,580
 For relationships that has been toxic or dangerous, your resurrection step could look a little

392
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,740
 different.

393
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:48,180
 It might mean just praying for that person from a distance or working on forgiveness

394
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:55,500
 without reconciliation or seeking counseling process to process your feelings.

395
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:05,860
 Setting healthy boundaries can be just as much of an act of resurrection as reconciliation.

396
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,180
 Remember that resurrection is an instant.

397
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,980
 Even Jesus' disciples took time to understand what is happening and you don't have to force

398
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,220
 yourself to respond immediately.

399
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:25,820
 But I do want to make space for us today to think about what God has been opening up in

400
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,020
 your heart and mind as well.

401
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,940
 So can I invite the worship team to come up.

402
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:36,980
 As I was preparing for this topic, the sermon, I do have a person in mind.

403
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:44,100
 A few years ago when I was in Australia, I would often talk to this person and every

404
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,380
 time I talked to that person, I would cry.

405
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,900
 The conversation is okay, it's nothing.

406
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:58,740
 But when I put my phone down, a wave of condemnation or manipulation just hit me and I couldn't

407
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,820
 enjoy the relationship I have with that person.

408
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,020
 And so in one of the worship session at church, I cry out to God.

409
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,380
 I worship and I go, "How can I fix this?

410
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,380
 What can I do?

411
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,300
 Is it something that's wrong in me that I'm not loving enough?"

412
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:23,740
 And that in that moment, I saw this person lying lifeless in front of me.

413
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,340
 Lifeless.

414
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:31,660
 And I picked that person up and I put it on the altar.

415
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,900
 And I go, "This person is dead.

416
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
 There's no life."

417
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,700
 But I surrender this person to God.

418
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,340
 Only Jesus, you have the power to resurrect.

419
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,340
 Only you can do what I cannot do.

420
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:59,660
 So I put this person on the altar and I believe that you will do this for me.

421
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,700
 And so I'd like you to pray.

422
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,100
 Close your eyes.

423
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:17,300
 I pray for those that are going through difficult relationships right now.

424
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:35,380
 That in your confined spaces, that you feel the presence of Jesus with you.

425
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:49,140
 That you will feel Him showing you His wounds on His hands and side.

426
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:57,580
 I pray for those that has a lot of self-condemnation.

427
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,340
 For those that are beating themselves up.

428
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:12,060
 That I pray for you to experience God, experiencing Jesus with you in that moment.

429
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:26,300
 That when He is not condemning you, why are you doing that to yourself?

430
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:37,020
 I pray for the breath of the Holy Spirit to come onto this room right now.

431
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:42,220
 Minister to us, Holy Spirit.

432
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:52,180
 That we recognize that there are things dying and there's nothing we can do about it.

433
00:33:52,180 --> 00:34:00,900
 And we need you, Holy Spirit.

434
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:10,900
 I pray that everyone is able to step into next week knowing that you are fully known

435
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,620
 and deeply loved.

436
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:23,860
 I pray that as you finish the service today, stepping into your home, your office, your

437
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:33,060
 family, your workplace, that you feel this protection around you.

438
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,860
 Our message is not a message of fixing something.

439
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:52,140
 It is about accepting, accepting our Jesus, dying for us, giving us life and loving us.

440
00:34:52,140 --> 00:35:09,260
 So I give you a time to pray, to pray for yourself, to talk to Jesus.

441
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,340
 Thank you, Holy Spirit.

442
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,340
 Thank you, Holy Spirit.

443
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:36,020
 We receive you, Holy Spirit.

444
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:44,500
 Thank you, Lord, for your protection, your love and your understanding.

445
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,740
 Thank you that you're with us.

446
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,180
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

447
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,540
