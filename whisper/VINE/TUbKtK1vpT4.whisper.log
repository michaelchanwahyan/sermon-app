[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   Yes, it is so good to see you.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.560]   Last night was a good night.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.400]   Does anyone know why?
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.000]   Because Germany won 2-0 on the Euros.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.160]   Now, of course, I couldn't stay up.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720]   I'm preaching today, but I'm excited.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.480]   Well, for my senior year,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.440]   I moved from Germany to the US and I lived with
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.320]   a host family that were raisin farmers.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.280]   Now, of course, you don't grow raisins, you grow grapes.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.680]   So I lived on actually in
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.680]   the middle of a vineyard for my senior year of high school.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.280]   Now, if you know anything about farming communities,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.280]   farming people, they work incredibly hard.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.800]   They're hardworking people.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.040]   Now, I was 17 years old,
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.200]   little self-focused, absorbed with myself at that time.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.000]   I didn't always know how to pick up after myself.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.600]   I also came from a different family,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.080]   different families do things differently.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.160]   I wasn't always aware of how I could be helpful.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.200]   I helped out in the house,
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.680]   I helped out in the yard,
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.120]   I helped out on the farm,
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.400]   even got to drive a tractor every once in a while if they let me,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.280]   got to drive a forklift.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.360]   Only was allowed to do that once.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.440]   But looking back,
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.760]   I really often really missed those opportunities to be helpful
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.560]   and to pick up on how I could
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.880]   contribute to what was going on that family and on that farm.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.240]   I'm so thankful for the host parents
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.120]   because they were so graceful and so patient with me.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.280]   Here I am totally oblivious,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.960]   maybe I put dishes in the dishwasher but never take them out,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.040]   they magically appear in the cupboards,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.680]   that type of thing.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.280]   But they were patient with me,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.600]   and of course they also told me how I could be helpful,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.960]   they helped me with that.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.960]   But all of that made my senior year
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.640]   one of the highlights really of my life.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.880]   It really was a turning point,
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.440]   an incredible year and it was because of their
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.160]   just love and patience that they showed me.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.720]   Now, I did not deserve this patience,
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.000]   but all of this makes me think about,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.400]   isn't it interesting how often we run out of patience,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.360]   how often there's so little patience in our lives.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.640]   Sometimes people don't have patience with us,
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.680]   we need a lot of grace and a lot of patience,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.760]   but then other times we lack
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.360]   or we run out of patience and grace for other people.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.880]   Now I want to share some examples,
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.480]   and I'm curious to see if you resonate with them.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.960]   The first one is walking.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.280]   When I walk and somebody is slow in front of me
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.920]   and I need to get somewhere, I get impatient.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.920]   Anyone with me on that?
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.240]   Few people, okay.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.560]   So you have some power walkers here, good.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.240]   There's other things that make me impatient.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.920]   Maybe I hear I don't drive, but I drove in other countries,
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.720]   when people don't use their signals.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.440]   It's like, "Hey, I can't read your mind
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.440]   that you are changing the lane, and I'm behind you,
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.920]   and you suddenly cut in front of me."
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.960]   So there was impatience with that.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.120]   But if we're honest, there's also a lot of impatience
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.200]   and lack of grace in our friendships,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.320]   and with family members, maybe with our parents,
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.480]   maybe with our brothers and sisters,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.240]   maybe with our children.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.000]   And there's also a lot of lack of patience
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.560]   when people hold different political views than we hold.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.720]   Like, "Why don't they get it?
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.040]   Why can't they see this?"
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.360]   You know, like, "Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk."
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.000]   You know, "Forget that."
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.480]   And so there's a lot of lack of grace, but you know what?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.200]   There's also lack of patience and grace
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.520]   a lot of times in the church.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.040]   Now, I was thinking about this.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.520]   I actually have this idea.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.320]   It's called patient church.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.080]   Now, for me, that's not what I always put together,
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.800]   but actually it should be put together,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.760]   that the church is a place where there's patience
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.480]   and where there's grace for each other,
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.920]   where we give that, but also where we receive that.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.640]   But often, often we lack that.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.640]   Now, obviously, patience and grace is something
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.240]   that every Christian, that God wants to work into our lives.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.640]   So I have a little statement here.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.000]   Patience is one of God's characteristics
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.680]   that he wants to grow and bring about in our lives.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.320]   Now, that's not always the most exciting thing.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.640]   "Yay, we're gonna grow in patience.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.400]   "We're gonna be able to put up with things."
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.920]   Is anyone excited with me?
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.240]   No, I don't really sense it.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.800]   "Yay."
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.320]   I have a little daughter, so I go into the clapping mode.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.880]   "Yay," you know?
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.880]   But really, God desires to bring that into our lives,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.160]   to grow that into our lives.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.160]   And the Bible talks about,
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.560]   actually the book that we're in, in the series,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.320]   Galatians, talks about the fruit of the spirit.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.240]   And one of them is patience.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.560]   And God wants to bring about patience in our lives.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.600]   He wants to see that unfold.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.360]   And so we're continuing our sermon series
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.920]   through the book of Galatians.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.040]   We're gonna see how Paul is just incredibly patient
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.160]   with the Galatians church that has gotten off track,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.480]   that's not treating him very nicely.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.160]   And then we're also, of course, gonna see
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.920]   how God wants to speak to us about being patient
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.560]   and being full of grace.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.800]   So let's go to Galatians 4.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.000]   We're starting in verse eight.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.240]   It says this, "Formerly, when you did not know God,
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.040]   "you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.520]   "But now that you know God, or rather are known by God,
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.960]   "how is it that you are turning back
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.120]   "to those weak and miserable forces?
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.040]   "Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.400]   "You are observing special days and months
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.460]   "and seasons and years.
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.260]   "I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.760]   "my efforts on you."
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.160]   So what's going on here?
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.520]   So Paul is saying,
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.480]   talking about a time when they didn't know God.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.000]   That's basically when they were idol worshipers.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.160]   Then there is a time where they've come to know God,
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.040]   where they have a personal relationship with him.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.280]   But he's saying like now they're going back
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.240]   to basically this idol worship.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.160]   He's like, "Why?
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.340]   "Why would you enslave yourself all over again?
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.020]   "Why in the world would you do that?"
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.680]   Now, this sounds like the Galatians are going back
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.760]   to the former way of life,
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.040]   like they're deconverting from their faith.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.960]   But that's actually not what's going on.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.320]   What they're doing is they're starting to observe
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.040]   the Mosaic Law.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.960]   You know, there's these days and these months
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.880]   and these special years.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.760]   And Paul is equating this religious observing
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.020]   and striving and paganism,
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.600]   where you're trying to manipulate God somehow
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.360]   to do something to give you favor.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.720]   He's equating that or drawing an analogy
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.920]   between that and the Galatians starting
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.680]   to observe the Mosaic Law and trying to gain
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.480]   right relationship with God.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.940]   He's like, "Why would you do that?
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.120]   "You already know God."
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.460]   So that's what's going on here.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:49.480]   Now, Paul, one of the big things he's emphasizing here
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.720]   is this whole thing about knowing God.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.240]   Not knowing, you know, you didn't know God.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.560]   So actually let's pull that up.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.600]   So it says there, "Formerly when you did not know God,"
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.040]   and then he talks about, "But now that you know God
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.840]   "or rather are known by God."
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.560]   So this is, whenever you see in the Bible
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.840]   something repeated, there's always something
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.700]   that God wants to especially highlight there.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.700]   Now, knowing is not just intellectually knowing
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.120]   or knowing something about someone.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.800]   It's actually also experientially knowing.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.320]   And so Paul is saying when he said that they know God,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.600]   that when they became a Christian,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.440]   they started to experientially experience
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   the Father God in their lives,
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.160]   that they actually experienced this relationship,
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.660]   experienced Him to be real.
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.760]   And he's taking them back to that experience
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.860]   that they've had.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.840]   And so that's why he's asking like,
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.800]   why would you wanna go back to anything else?
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.880]   You already have a relationship with God, the Father.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.240]   But then what's interesting is
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.940]   he actually almost mid-sentence
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.000]   kind of corrects him or changes his direction
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.200]   instead of talking about you know God.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.600]   He says, "Or rather are known by God."
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.320]   Now, what's the difference with that?
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.360]   Why does he make that shift?
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.700]   Well, I'm gonna try to explain this
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.160]   with a little bit of a silly analogy,
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.600]   and this is not a true story.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.000]   So I'll just put that out there.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.100]   I try to choose a person
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.240]   that I thought most people would be familiar with.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.840]   The person's name is Taylor Swift.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.080]   All right, so okay, most people are nodding.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.000]   Most people are familiar.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.720]   Okay, good, I chose the right person then.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   So let's say I tell you, I know Taylor Swift.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.400]   I've met her once and I talked to her for 20 seconds.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.000]   You're like, well, that's pretty cool.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.320]   You met her for 20 seconds.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.640]   You know, some people would be excited about that,
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.720]   but it's really, it doesn't mean that much.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.680]   It means something, but it doesn't mean that much.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.680]   But what if Taylor Swift in an interview says,
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.040]   "I know Tim Brixel.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.320]   "I know this guy.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.440]   "You know, he's known to me."
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.060]   And that would be quite different, right,
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.240]   if I say, "She knows me," right?
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.320]   So what Paul is saying,
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.520]   actually what's a lot more important than us knowing God
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.480]   is that we are known by God, that he knows us.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:33.080]   You are known by God, the creator of the universe
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.360]   who holds everything in his hands, who knows, he knows you.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.200]   You are his beloved child.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.460]   And again, Paul is trying to take the Galatians
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.000]   to reminding them of this incredible truth
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.080]   about their identity.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.320]   They are known by God.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.680]   They are children of God.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.840]   He knows their name.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.960]   He knows what's going on in their lives.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.420]   He knows everything.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.280]   That's amazing.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.680]   That's incredible.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.520]   And again, the question is,
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   why would you go back to something else?
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.760]   Now, I have shared here before
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.480]   about going through a difficult personal relationship,
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.280]   and there was a break, and I'm not gonna go into details.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.240]   If you are interested, you can listen
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.880]   to the Longing for Healing sermon series.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.000]   But so I was abandoned, I was left,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.120]   and I was living with somebody that was an acquaintance
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.840]   that later on became a friend,
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.280]   and this was the first time of me going back to church
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.480]   after all that happened.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.780]   And so I step into this church.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.400]   The pastor is, you know, I don't know anything about them.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.980]   They don't know me, and he is preaching about Psalm 139,
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.960]   and then they sing a song by Tommy something.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.120]   It's not something, it's Tommy Walker, there we go.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.520]   And it's "He Knows My Name."
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.000]   So I wanna share with you some of the lyrics from that song.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.600]   It's old school, I love it,
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.760]   but you should go listen to it.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.800]   But, you know, it's my, or even earlier generation.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.480]   It goes like this.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.960]   "I have a maker, he formed my heart.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.400]   "Before even time began, my life was in his hands.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.920]   "He knows my name.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.360]   "He knows my every thought.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   "He sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.980]   "I have a father, he calls me his own.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.920]   "He'll never leave me no matter where I go."
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.600]   Now, as I was stepping into this church,
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.640]   I felt abandoned.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.920]   I felt left.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.480]   God was not, even though I went to church,
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.520]   you know, that he knows me was not on my radar.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.700]   And so as we're singing a song,
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.440]   I'm just reminded of that God knows me.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.240]   That I'm not alone, that he is with me.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.880]   That I'm not abandoned, that he sees each tear
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.720]   that I was crying in that time.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.160]   And that was so comforting.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.520]   I'm already known by God.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.900]   It's not about my life being perfect
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.640]   or my circumstances being good or bad.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.800]   God knows me.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.240]   That's incredible.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.800]   And that brings so much comfort
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.400]   when we realize the truth about our identity.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.940]   But we constantly or regularly forget that.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.160]   We forget our identity.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.480]   That's why Paul, as he's writing to the Galatians,
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.280]   he's like trying to take them back
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.840]   to this basic understanding.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.640]   You are known by God.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.720]   He knows you.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.120]   He knows your name.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.120]   He knows every tear that has been falling down your face.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.640]   Every single one.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.040]   He has not missed it.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.040]   And he is with you.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.960]   He is for you.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.640]   He is not against you.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:06.440]   'Cause he's trying to bring them back to this truth.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.280]   You do not have to go back to somehow try
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.860]   to earn this relationship with God the Father.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.680]   You already have it.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.040]   He already has adopted you as his sons, as his daughters.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.320]   He already loves you.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.640]   He is already with you.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:34.000]   And so Paul, it doesn't make any sense
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.040]   to go from not knowing God to knowing God
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.560]   to now pretending like we don't know him
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.520]   and trying to somehow gain right standing with him.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.400]   These human efforts, this religiosity,
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.240]   it is always a dead end.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.480]   It never delivers.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.860]   You cannot save yourself.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.340]   You cannot make yourself feel good.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:59.400]   Only the power of God, his love, his care, his presence,
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.800]   this Holy Spirit inside of you
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.900]   can start bringing about this wholeness and restoration,
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.060]   give you salvation, make you part of his family.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.720]   So that's why Paul is taking him back.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.180]   And he's being so patient.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.100]   He's actually been doing this all throughout the letter.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.500]   And he pleads with the Galatians
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.420]   in all these different ways.
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.780]   And he is trying to win them back
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.300]   to the basic gospel message, the basic truth.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:32.620]   So let's continue.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.820]   (clears throat)
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.180]   In Galatians 4, verse 12, it says this.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.420]   I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.340]   For I became like you.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.180]   You did me no wrong.
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.580]   As you know, it was because of an illness
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.820]   that I first preached the gospel to you.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.500]   Even though my illness was a trial to you,
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.180]   you did not treat me with contempt or scorn.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.900]   Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.340]   as if I were Christ Jesus himself.
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.780]   Where then is your blessing for me now?
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.780]   I can testify that if you could have done so,
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.820]   you would have torn out your eye and given them to me.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:21.300]   Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:26.700]   So this is again a heart-to-heart moment.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.340]   Actually, in the letter before, Paul is doing
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.300]   a bunch of theology and going back in the history of Israel.
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.060]   But here he's really getting to this heart-to-heart talk.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.420]   He's reminding them of when they first met.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.980]   It's like when two, actually, in the first service,
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.900]   Pastor Ivan was talking about how him and Michi
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.820]   first met and their relationship.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.940]   He's like taking him back to that sweet moment
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.860]   of first meeting.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.740]   And he was ill at the time.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.860]   Scholars don't know what exactly was going on.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.020]   Was it a sickness?
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.380]   Was he ill because he was persecuted, beaten,
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.220]   and was disfigured and someone needing recovering
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.060]   from all of that?
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.420]   We don't know.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.180]   But he must have been in quite a horrible shape.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.540]   And so they take him in and he preaches the gospel,
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.260]   being apparently extremely sick to them.
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:19.020]   They come to faith, they experience God the Father.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:25.380]   And even though his illness is actually a trial,
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.780]   there is so much needing to care for him.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.980]   It's really not convenient.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.100]   But they treat him, because he preaches gospel message
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.340]   about Jesus, he's the messenger,
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.460]   but they treat him as if he was Jesus himself
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.860]   with so much love, 'cause they experienced
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.980]   just God's goodness in their lives.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.100]   And that was absolutely incredible.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.380]   But then in verse 15, Paul says, "But what happened?"
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.100]   Like we had this amazing experience.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.340]   It was so powerful, you loved me.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.580]   You were willing to tear out your eye.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.060]   You would do anything for me.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.220]   That's what that means, tearing out your eye,
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.340]   not literally tearing out your eye.
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.980]   You would do anything for me.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.380]   But why are you treating me now as an enemy?
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.620]   What's going on here?
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.580]   Now it's tough when people suddenly that we loved,
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:33.860]   that we cared for, that we had a good relationship with,
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.740]   suddenly see us as their enemies,
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.740]   and suddenly don't have good feelings towards us.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.100]   Now I don't know if you've experienced that.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.260]   I think if you're older, you probably have.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.100]   You know, we experience it at different degrees,
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.140]   but it happens.
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:53.380]   And Paul, he's remaining graceful and patient
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.820]   and leaning in, even though they're treating him
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.020]   as an enemy.
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.700]   You know, that's incredible.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.580]   Like, I don't know about you,
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.060]   if somebody treats you like an enemy that,
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.380]   you know, maybe for a little bit,
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.020]   you're able to have some patience, have some grace,
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.940]   but then you run out of it.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.660]   And you're like, I'm gonna cut my losses,
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.420]   you know, peace out, see you later.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.860]   Like, I just can't deal with that anymore.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.220]   But Paul keeps leaning in, he keeps showing grace,
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.260]   he keeps showing love.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.860]   But Paul is also making the point,
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.020]   you know, I have not changed.
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.060]   I've remained the same.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.860]   I've preached the same gospel I preached then
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.100]   that I'm preaching now, that I'm telling you now about.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.020]   But your feelings towards me have changed
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.620]   because the Galatians are starting to buy
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.980]   into a different gospel.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.940]   And so now their feelings towards Paul have been changing
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.220]   and they treat him as an enemy.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.380]   And I mean, that is just tough.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.380]   That's tough.
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:56.780]   He keeps fighting for them, even though they keep fighting him.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.820]   I really like that line.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.660]   I'll say it again.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.500]   He keeps fighting for them,
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.300]   even though they keep fighting him.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.100]   Just think about that.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.700]   Somebody's fighting you,
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.620]   but then that, but you keep fighting for them,
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.580]   their well-being.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.020]   It's amazing, right?
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.380]   Talking about grace, patience, love.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.460]   So let's continue in Galatians verse 17.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:27.380]   It says this, "Those people are zealous to win you over."
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.460]   So by those people, he's talking about agitators,
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.940]   a group of agitators, a rival missionaries
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.500]   that came in after Paul into the church
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.260]   that were saying, "Hey, this guy only taught you
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.620]   half the truth.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.980]   You know, here's the other half."
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.020]   So it's about them.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.460]   So those people are zealous to win you over,
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.340]   but for no good.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.220]   What they want is to alienate you from us
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.020]   so that you may have zeal for them.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.500]   It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good,
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.740]   and to be so always, not just when I'm with you.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.740]   My dear children, for whom I'm again
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.740]   in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.740]   how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.020]   because I'm perplexed about you.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:23.460]   So first, he's talking about the motives, really,
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.460]   of the agitators, the group of people that came in
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.940]   and that are stirring up things with the Galatians.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.060]   And he's saying, "Hey, they're trying to separate us."
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.100]   And really what they want is for you to be zealous for them,
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:42.100]   for you to honor them, for you to put them on a pedestal.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.940]   That's what they want.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.260]   That's really what they're after.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.780]   They're talking all spiritual,
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.420]   but that's really what matters to them.
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.060]   And what an incredible contrast it is
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.340]   that that's not what Paul is about.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:01.380]   Paul, he truly cares about them.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.300]   He is for them.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.980]   And like I said, he's fighting for them,
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.660]   even though they're fighting him.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.260]   And now he expresses his heart in verse 19.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.380]   So let me read this again.
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.300]   It says, "My dear children,
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.100]   for whom I'm again in the pains of childbirth
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.780]   until Christ is formed in you."
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:24.660]   So Paul is concerned for the Galatians' maturity,
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.060]   their spiritual well-being.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:32.060]   That's why he wants God's goodness to unfold in their lives.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.620]   That's why he's not giving up on them.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.140]   I'm gonna fight for them.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.260]   I'm gonna fight for their well-being
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.860]   because God loves them.
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.700]   They're worth it.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.180]   I wanna see the goodness of God unfold
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.460]   in this group of people's lives,
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.980]   even though they're treating me right now as an enemy.
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:51.980]   And he uses the metaphor of giving birth for a second time.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.060]   Now, I've never given birth,
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.700]   but I know that this is painful.
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.620]   And then just imagine the ancient times
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.140]   without any of the anesthetics and epidurals
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.300]   and all of that, you know,
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.340]   and then doing it a second time.
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.660]   So Paul is saying this is taking like some extra effort,
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.940]   double effort, you know, to see Christ fully formed
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.620]   and then see the life of Jesus unfold in their lives.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:24.500]   But that's his desire, so he doesn't give up on them.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.260]   He doesn't treat them like a lost cause.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.620]   But here's a question.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.980]   How is Paul able to do that?
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.020]   How is Paul able to be patient and graceful
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.460]   with people who are treating him as an enemy
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.420]   and seeking their well-being?
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.820]   Yeah, how do you do that?
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:52.140]   How do you do that when somebody's hating on you?
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:56.740]   Well, Paul, he writes a letter to one of his people
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.900]   he was mentoring and also co-laborers, co-ministers,
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:05.900]   Timothy, 1 Timothy 2, 15 and 16 says this.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.780]   "Here's a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.300]   "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.380]   "of whom I am the worst.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.620]   "But for that very reason, I was shown mercy
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.340]   "so that in me, the worst of sinners,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:27.340]   "Christ Jesus might display his immense patience
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.700]   "as an example for those who would believe in him
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.180]   "and receive eternal life."
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:40.340]   So Christ has shown Paul immense patience.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.060]   That means a lot of patience.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.060]   Now, earlier in the letter to the Galatians in chapter one,
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.860]   Paul talks about that he used to persecute the church.
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:55.060]   He proved Christians being murdered.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.500]   Paul was approving of that.
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.860]   He even talks about an act that he was breathing
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.860]   murderous threats as he was trying to go
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.660]   after the Christians.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.060]   And then Jesus meets him, he appears to him,
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.140]   there's a revelation on the road to Damascus.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.780]   And then through this whole experience,
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.820]   Paul ends up becoming a Christian.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:22.180]   But it's just by this sheer grace and mercy of God,
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.380]   he didn't deserve it.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.500]   None of us ever deserve Jesus healing,
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.220]   saving work in our lives.
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:34.140]   But he's able to be patient and show grace
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.300]   because Jesus has been patient with him
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.140]   and has shown him grace.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.540]   And he just lives out of this mercy and grace
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.660]   and out of his identity as someone who's loved,
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.860]   who is forgiven.
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.860]   So now he can turn around and as he relies
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.540]   on the Holy Spirit, start showing mercy and grace
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.420]   to other people, start fighting for people
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.780]   who are hating on him because he desires,
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.540]   just like God desired for his life,
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.460]   the good to unfold in his life,
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.540]   he now turns around and desires that goodness of God
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.540]   to unfold in somebody else's life.
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:14.020]   So what about us?
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.540]   Like Paul, Jesus has shown us grace and patience
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.820]   so we can become people who show grace
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.300]   and patience to others.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.780]   You know, we also, if you're a Christian,
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.860]   if you're a Jesus follower, you also are known by God.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.020]   He knows your name.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.580]   He loves you.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.060]   He is for you, not against you.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.820]   He is unfolding good things in your life.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:45.620]   And when we live in that identity as being known by God,
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:51.660]   you know, it frees us up to start loving and serving
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:56.060]   and caring and fighting and wrestling
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.980]   and doing whatever it takes to see the goodness of God
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.780]   unfold in other people's lives.
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:09.460]   Now, when I was a teenager, my parents,
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:13.580]   this is very fitting for today, made me go to youth group.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:18.300]   So I was, my parents were Christians.
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.660]   I was not a Christian at the time.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.100]   They're like, you have to go one year to youth group.
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.060]   And then after that, you can make up your mind.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.340]   So one year, that's a long time,
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.540]   especially if you don't feel like going.
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.420]   So, but what I had no choice, so I went.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.980]   And, you know, after some time,
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.980]   the youth pastor, he labeled me as a troublemaker.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:48.220]   And he actually asked me not to come back to youth group.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.300]   Now, I didn't want to tell my parents.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.780]   So I just kept coming, just kept coming back.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.340]   But you know what made the difference for me?
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.700]   Was that why, you know, it was not just him,
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:09.180]   was other people that sort of had given up on me,
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.540]   that had cut me off, cut the cost, you know,
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.060]   I don't want to deal with him.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.220]   But there was one guy named Wolfram, awesome German name.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:24.140]   And he, you know, he started caring for me,
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.580]   hanging out with me, going bowling with me,
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.820]   my friends before youth group,
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.220]   there was like a bowling center right next to that church.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:35.740]   And, but also starting to speak some truth into my life,
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.260]   you know, calling me out on some things that weren't good.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.260]   But it was because of his love and his acceptance
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.980]   that after the year was up,
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.300]   I decided to continue going to youth group.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.260]   And I know that God worked through this man
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.580]   because he, instead of seeing,
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.500]   running out of patience and not showing me grace,
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.260]   he saw what God wanted to do in my life,
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.660]   and he fought for me, he didn't give up on me
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.660]   when others had given up on me,
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.900]   so that the life of Christ could unfold in my life.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.140]   Amen, that's right.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:18.540]   And I just wonder, where could we show grace and patience
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.300]   and make a big difference in someone else's life?
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:33.860]   Who is God calling you to fight for and not give up on?
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.220]   We show grace and patience,
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.740]   not just to put up with other people.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.140]   A lot of times when you talk about patience,
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.460]   like God give me patience
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.020]   so I can put up with this other person,
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.900]   make it through the day.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.300]   You know, that's like a lot of times
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.300]   how as Christians we think about patience,
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.060]   so I can just put up with somebody
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.340]   and move on with my life.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.740]   It's not that, not that I say it loud,
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.100]   it's kind of, that's true, right?
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.820]   Yes, yes, yes, okay, good.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.900]   But God doesn't just want us to put up with people.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.020]   He wants us to fight for people,
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.940]   for the life of Christ to unfold in their lives.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.220]   He wants us to be people who show patience and grace,
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.780]   you know, so that others can know Jesus,
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.100]   that they can know his love,
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.420]   that they're not written off and forgotten.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.060]   That's what he calls us to do.
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:36.020]   So, but how do we actually have this patience?
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.380]   Well, it's all great, you know,
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.220]   you're talking about his patience,
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.260]   but I don't have any patience, pastor.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.140]   What do I do?
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:47.260]   Well, there's a few things that we can do,
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.860]   but ultimately, and I'll share those in a second,
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.060]   but ultimately it is the Holy Spirit works on our life.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.860]   This is a supernatural work of God in your life.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.140]   You know, you're not gonna love somebody
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.820]   who doesn't feel great about you
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.500]   unless the power of God,
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.860]   the love of God is at work in your life.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.500]   And that's where Christians are called to be different
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.700]   than other people.
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.780]   We're not showing patience to people we like,
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.820]   we show patience to all kinds of people,
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.500]   even when sometimes it's hard for us,
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.540]   and we're gonna seek their wellbeing,
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.820]   we're gonna seek what's good for them,
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.780]   'cause we wanna see God's goodness unfold in their lives.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.420]   But, so what are some things that we do?
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.980]   Well, the first one, there's three things.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:30.060]   The first one is we can pray to God
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.100]   and ask him to give us patience.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.620]   Now, this for me is actually like an ongoing dialogue.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.660]   It's not like, you know, one time at night I pray,
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.100]   five weeks ago, it forgot to give me patience.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.780]   This is like every day, Jesus, give me patience.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.340]   Forgive me for not being patient for other persons.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.500]   Jesus, help me to seek the goodness of this person's life,
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.780]   even though I don't feel like it right now.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.660]   Jesus, you know, give me grace.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.540]   Jesus, forgive me for my attitude, blah, blah, blah.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.940]   So this ongoing dialogue
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.940]   and relationship with God the Father.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.980]   And when we do that, we give the Holy Spirit space
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.220]   'cause we're surrendering to God.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.180]   Our Lord, here, here I am.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.780]   You know, change me, transform me,
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.180]   make me a different person.
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.700]   And then the Holy Spirit works.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.980]   Now, it's a very incremental change most of the time,
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.140]   meaning it's a slow process.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.300]   But he really transforms who we are
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.700]   so that we can fight for people, for their well-being,
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.700]   be patient, be graceful, even in a different way
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.900]   because the Spirit of God is at work on us.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.260]   So that's the first thing is praying.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.500]   The second is we can practice being patient
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.100]   with others in our daily lives.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.380]   Now, a lot of times you wanna do the big hero moment
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:41.300]   like Wolfram, who stepped up and showed patience to me.
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.220]   You know, it's like, I'm gonna be a hero.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.060]   I'm gonna step up.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:49.060]   I'm gonna show, you know, this very problematic youth child,
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.900]   you know, patience and grace.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.860]   But actually, the way we become patient people
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.180]   is we practice daily in the little things in our lives.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.500]   You know, patience with our spouses,
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.780]   patience with our friends, patience with our parents,
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.980]   patience with the people walking slowly in front of us,
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.220]   patience, you know, this is the training ground
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.020]   where we surrender and submit to God
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.780]   and ask him to give us patience.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:21.140]   And then thirdly, we can meditate on God's patience,
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.980]   grace, and forgiveness he has shown us.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.660]   A lot of times I find when I lack grace and patience
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.140]   for someone, I actually have forgotten
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.860]   what Jesus has done for me.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.900]   And so when I go back to what Jesus has done for me,
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.140]   when I start not just quickly thinking about it,
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.620]   but actually taking time, saying, thank you, Jesus,
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.620]   you know, that you died for my sins on the cross,
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:47.020]   that you're so patient to even go to the cross for me,
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.300]   so graceful to do that for me, you know,
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.260]   with all my sin, all my junk,
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.860]   but you were willing to do that.
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.980]   So then suddenly as I meditate and pray over that
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.540]   and read that and give God thanks for that,
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.620]   then it puts this other little thing
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.940]   where I'm lacking grace, where I'm lacking patience,
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.660]   it puts that into perspective.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.820]   And it's like, oh yeah, that's right.
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.060]   Sorry, Lord, that you showed me so much grace and patience,
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.780]   and I can't even show in this little instance
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.780]   grace and patience to this other person.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.820]   And so those are three ways that we can invite
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.860]   the Holy Spirit to work and to bear
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.060]   the fruit of patience in our lives,
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:31.260]   and to become people who start fighting
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.740]   for the well-being, the flourishing of others,
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.740]   and that we can show this patience and grace
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:42.020]   so that can unfold in their lives.
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.380]   Now I wanna invite the worship team to come up,
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:50.100]   and I have some reflection questions for you.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.380]   Where is your patience being tested right now?
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:59.820]   This past week, past month, this morning,
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:00.980]   on the way to church.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:06.100]   Who are you struggling to be patient with?
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:10.740]   I found that I sometimes have certain personality types
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.780]   that I struggle with.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:15.320]   You know, who are you struggling to be patient with?
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:21.100]   And then thirdly, who is God calling you to fight for,
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.580]   show grace and patience to, and not give up on?
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:31.660]   So I just wanna invite right now just a time of prayer.
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.340]   We're gonna take two minutes just for you and yourself,
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.940]   between you and God, just come before and just pray to Him,
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.820]   and ask Him to meet you in whatever is going on,
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.820]   wherever you need that patience and grace,
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.820]   or maybe He's highlighting somebody
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.300]   He wants you to fight for.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.100]   And I just want to invite you to connect with God
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.900]   and to connect with the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.020]   And so then two minutes time, I'll close us in a prayer.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.380]   So let's do that right now.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:01.280]   (gentle music)
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.860]   (gentle music)
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.140]   (gentle music)
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.720]   (gentle music)
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.300]   (gentle music)
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.880]   (gentle music)
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.460]   (gentle music)
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.040]   (gentle music)
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.620]   (gentle music)
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:32.080]   (gentle music)
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   (gentle music)
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:43.620]   (gentle music)
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.200]   (gentle music)
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   (gentle music)
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:59.200]   (gentle music)
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:05.200]   (gentle music)
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:10.200]   (gentle music)
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.780]   (gentle music)
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:38.900]   I wanna invite everyone to stand.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.980]   (gentle music)
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:47.940]   And just as a pastor, just wanting to receive from God,
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.740]   I wanna invite you to stretch out your hands
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.240]   in front of you.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.200]   It's like a posture of surrender, like, "Lord, here I am.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.360]   "Just meet me.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.560]   "Let me pray over you."
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:03.620]   Jesus, I thank you first and foremost
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.740]   that you have grace and patience for us.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.620]   And maybe as some of us right now,
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.580]   we're reflecting, maybe we just felt bad
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.080]   about something that happened.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.160]   But I thank you that you love forgiving us,
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.660]   that you love showing us grace,
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.580]   that you love showing us patience.
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:23.500]   So I pray right now that you show your love and grace
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.240]   and patience to those where that was what was going on.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.780]   But Lord, I also thank you that we're a work in progress,
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.060]   that you are not finished with us,
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:38.540]   that you are shaping and molding us into patient people,
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:42.500]   graceful people that reflect your character
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.980]   in our everyday lives to the people around us.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.340]   And Lord, I pray that as a church and as people,
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.620]   you would strengthen us, you would grow us,
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.480]   the Holy Spirit, that you would bear that fruit
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.860]   of patience in our lives,
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.060]   that we would be a patient church,
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.020]   that we would be patient with each other
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.500]   and graceful with each other,
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.520]   that we can be patient and graceful with those around us.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.440]   And Lord, I pray that you strengthen us right now
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.240]   where we need that patience and grace,
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.400]   where we don't have it, where we're empty,
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.480]   but that you will give it.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.600]   Lord, will you release your grace
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.320]   and your patience on us right now?
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.400]   Will you renew us?
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.040]   Will you strengthen us?
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.720]   And will you allow us to be people who for one,
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.080]   fight for one another here in this church,
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.040]   that we love each other,
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.400]   that we fight for each other's wellbeing,
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.120]   'cause we wanna see Christ fully formed in each other.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:42.000]   But I also pray that you just put individuals
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.200]   on our hearts and minds,
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.560]   where we're the right person to fight for them.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.600]   Whether today or later in the week,
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.400]   you just highlight someone,
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.880]   Tim, I want you to fight for this person.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.680]   I want you to fight for that person.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.960]   And Lord, will you give us the grace
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.360]   and the strength to do that?
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.660]   So Lord, we thank you for your love,
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.760]   your patience, your grace, for your work in our lives.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.280]   And we give you all the praise and glory.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.000]   And pray this in your name, Jesus, amen.
