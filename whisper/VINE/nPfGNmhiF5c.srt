1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Amen. Isn't God good? Amen.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 Hey, can we thank our worship team for these guys?

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,000
 So good every week.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 And have a seat, have a seat.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 I'm really excited we got Pastor Ellison with us this morning,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 continuing our series on Philippians called "An Alternative Society."

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Can we put our hands together as we welcome Ellison to be here?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Let's stretch out our hands and let's pray for him.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Father, we're grateful for this young man, for Brittany, for Izzy, for this family.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Lord, thank you for just so many years, Lord, of faithful stewardship to your church in Hong Kong.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Lord, thank you for Ellison's heart, for his people, for this people of Hong Kong.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And Lord, as we open up this topic of unity this morning, Lord, our hearts cry out to you.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Lord, we need your heart, we need your word, we need your spirit.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 We recognize, Lord, that it's hard for us to find ourselves united.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And so, Lord, as Ellison, having done the deep work of prayer and study and research,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 infused by your spirit, and now does the important prophetic word of speaking into our spirits.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Lord, would you just fill him.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And Lord, we're grateful that it's not just his words, Lord, but it's your word, most importantly,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 that opens our hearts to change and renewal.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And so we pray for that word, Lord, for each one of us.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 And we thank you for this, in Jesus' name.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Everyone says?

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Amen.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Amen.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Thank you, Andrew.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Good morning, everyone.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Good morning, those of you joining us online, wherever you're joining us from.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 It's good to be on your screens, but it's also good to be here with everyone, my family, this morning.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 All right, imagine with me for a moment that you didn't know who I was at all.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I was a stranger we just met on the street, and we're starting to make small talk.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Okay, I know, but it's small talk, okay?

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 We're making small talk, and we're chatting, and you know nothing about me,

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 so you ask one of the most common questions you might ask.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 What do you do for a living?

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Where I live, there's a lot of aunties always around, and they love talking to me because of my son.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 When I play with my son, they see a cute baby, so they approach the baby,

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 and then inevitably they have to talk to me, right?

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 So it's just part of the deal.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 So anyway, we talk, and they ask me, "Oh, so what do you do?

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 How long have you lived here?"

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 All that sort of boring stuff.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 So whenever I tell them I'm a pastor, their reaction is always,

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 "My, my, you are a pastor?"

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 It's like, "What? You are a pastor? No way, I don't believe it."

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Actually, this is quite often the reaction I get when I tell people I'm a pastor.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 They think things like, "But you look so young," right?

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Thank you very much, of course, right?

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 "You don't look like a pastor. You don't sound like a pastor.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 You don't act like a pastor.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I would have thought you were a male model or something like that, right?

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But not a pastor."

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 All right, I understand. It's okay.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 In our local Hong Kong context, right,

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 there's a certain expectation of what a pastor is supposed to look like.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I'm going to try to say this respectfully, okay?

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 There are normally men of a certain vintage, okay?

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 They wear these old-school suits, and they act kind of boring.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 They're rather sensible people, right?

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I, on the other hand, am still sometimes mistaken for a university student.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 No offense to university students out there.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 I'm prone to say slightly cheeky and act in slightly cheeky ways sometimes.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 That's just who I am.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But it just goes to show, right, for better or worse,

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 there is some sort of expectation as to what a pastor is supposed to be like.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 But why don't we zoom out for a minute?

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 What about just being a Christian in general?

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 What expectations are there?

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 What reactions have you faced when you've told people,

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 "Yeah, I'm a Christian. I'm a follower of Jesus."

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Maybe hopefully most of us, it's been, "Yeah, I can see that.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 You know, I can see that you're a Christian."

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 But maybe perhaps also there's been times, "What? No way.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 You're a Christian?"

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 We're continuing our series through Paul's letter to the Philippians,

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 and we reach a very challenging passage in the letter today.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 But it's also a challenge, I hope, that we can rise up as this church,

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 but just as Christians in general, together.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I mean, after all, we've named this series an alternative society,

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 so it would be pretty pointless for us to keep speaking on this topic

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 week in and week out for how many--

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I think we end this for the next few more weeks at least

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 if it doesn't actually have an effect on how we live,

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 if it doesn't shape us to be the society that God has called us to be.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And so understanding this passage today is going to be key part of that.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And as we look especially as our society, in our city, in our church.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I mean, this is my home. Hong Kong is my home, born and raised here.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Often we, Hong Kongers, even refer to this place that we love so much

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 as "Home-Kong," right?

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 It's got the best food, it's got the best views, it's got the best everything.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 We love our city.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 But all of us have at the same time also experienced

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 what it's been like to live here in this place.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And one of the most heartbreaking things that we have seen

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 is the disunity that's happened amongst our citizens.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Over the past years, as I've been talking to people on the street,

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 as I talk to the person that's serving me food at the restaurant,

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 the taxi driver, the person sitting next to me on the minibus,

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 whoever it is, all the uncles and aunties,

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 what I really sense and what I hear is a deep sadness.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 The reaction is always like, "Hong Kong never used to be like this."

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 "Our city has changed so much."

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 They say things like, "I never used to lock my door."

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 "But now I'm even afraid to go out at night."

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 "People have become so rude and selfish."

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 "Don't you think so? Everyone on the street right now only cares about themselves."

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 "It never used to be like this."

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Or within families, I've heard so many stories about people,

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 "My children, my son, my daughter, they won't even talk to me anymore."

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 "I don't even know what I've done wrong."

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And these sentiments of disunity have even crept into the Christian communities,

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 into the churches, and yes, let's not be naive, church,

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 even right here at the Vine.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And it's definitely had an effect on us.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 The church in Philippi, who Paul's writing to,

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 was also facing similar challenges of disunity.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 As persecution and uncertainty rose up in the city,

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 the church began to be divided as to how they were supposed to navigate through this challenge.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 And within the church, there became attitudes of distrust, of self-seeking,

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 and as to wondering whether or not God was really going to help them through this tough time.

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 In fact, in Philippians chapter 4, we see two church leaders,

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 two women church leaders, Iodia and Synthicae,

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 they had such a big argument with each other that it threatened to tear the church apart.

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And Paul, having seen the destructive power of disunity at work in the church in Rome,

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 that he also loved very much,

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 was trying to encourage the church in Philippi not to go down the same path.

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 So why is this passage important to us?

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Well, we as a Christian community, we as a church,

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 are at a point in this city that sits at the crossroads of history.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Like I said, we're a church that has seen the destructive power of disunity

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 rip through our communities, and we have a choice to make.

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 We can either let this disunity run rampant in our church and in our society,

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 or we can take this opportunity to demonstrate that there is a different way to live.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 There is an opportunity for us to demonstrate who we are as Christians,

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 not just through our individual conduct, as important as that is,

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 but rather through how we remain united through the toughest of times.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And if we can do this, when people look at us, there will be no doubt in their mind who we are.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 We are Christians.

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 We are followers of Jesus.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 So we're going to read today's passage in a moment.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It might sound familiar because Pastor Andrew spoke about this passage in the introduction to this series.

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 If you remember, his focus back in that week one was to look at us as citizens of heaven.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 We're going to talk about that a little bit today, but like I said,

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 our main focus of today is going to be on the topic of unity.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And so in the spirit of unity, I want to invite someone from our congregation to come and read this passage.

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 This is Hayden, ladies and gentlemen.

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Hayden is one of our leaders at 180.

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And in the spirit of unity, actually, Hayden has just really started a really cool project.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Him and a group of friends have started a gym in Kuntong,

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 and it's being renovated right now, but it's a small gym.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 But their heart is really to bring citizens in that area together,

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 have a place for them to work out, and use it as a platform for the gospel.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So that's a really amazing thing Hayden is doing.

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 If you want to know more, I'm sure you can ask him about that at the end of the sermon.

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Is that okay, dude? Yeah, okay.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 I just threw that on you.

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 But anyway, Hayden is going to read this passage for us.

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Chapter 4, verse 27.

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 "Whatever happens, conduct yourself in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Then whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence,

160
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I will know that you stand firm in one spirit,

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 striving together as one for the faith of the gospel,

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you.

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed,

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 but that you will be saved, and that by God.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ,

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had,

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 and now hear that I still have."

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Thank you, Hayden.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 So as Pastor Andrew has already explained to us,

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 the city of Philippi was a Roman colony,

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 which meant that the church in Philippi was a church living in an environment

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 that was extremely hostile to their faith.

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And as Paul once again finds himself locked up in prison,

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 he writes to this church, these group of Christians,

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 not to ask for help, but rather to thank them and to encourage them

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 and to remind them about the importance of unity

178
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 in the midst of the challenges they're facing.

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 This is a community that Paul loves deeply,

180
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 and he really wants to go and visit them someday.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 He talks later on about, you know, "One day, really soon,

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I hope, and I come, and I'm going to see you face to face."

183
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 But he doesn't know for sure that that's going to be able to happen.

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 There's a whole bunch of stuff that could happen to him right now,

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 since he is in prison.

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I mean, he might continue to be in prison.

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 He might be sent away somewhere else.

188
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 There's a chance that he might even be executed.

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And so one of the first things that stood out to me

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 as I read this passage were the words right at the beginning,

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 where it says, "Whatever happens."

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Whatever happens.

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 One thing clear over the past few years is that we literally, right,

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 we have no idea what's going to happen in the future.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 The events we've seen unfold in Hong Kong and around the world

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 would have been so hard, even for the most perceptive of people,

197
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 to be able to predict.

198
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 And that's just on the macro level, right?

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 I'm sure that in your personal lives, and in the lives of your friends

200
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 and the families and the people around you,

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 there have been things, events that have occurred

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 that have left you thinking, "What in the world?

203
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 How did this even happen?

204
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 I never expected my life to take this turn.

205
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 I never expected my life to look like the way it does now."

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 But this is why Paul says exactly, "Whatever happens."

207
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And I think the encouragement here is this.

208
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Whatever happens, it shouldn't change our faith in Jesus.

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 It shouldn't change the fact that we should live lives worthy of the gospel.

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Whatever happens, it shouldn't threaten to tear our unity apart.

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 You see, there's a real danger we often fall into.

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 When things get tough, right, we begin to give ourselves excuses.

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 We begin to say things like, "Man, you know,

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 things are just kind of busy and crazy in Hong Kong right now.

215
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And I'm kind of busy.

216
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 I'm just going to wait until things calm down a bit

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 until I get serious about my relationship with Jesus."

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Or perhaps it might be like, "There is no way I'm ever going to talk

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 to this person or that person ever again.

220
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Have you heard what they said?

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Do you see what they post on social media?

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 I'm never talking to that person again."

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 We begin to say things like that.

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 But what is Paul teaching here?

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Paul is teaching us that we must try hard not to conduct our lives

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 based upon situations and circumstances, but rather as followers of Jesus,

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 our goal is to be shaped by the kingdom of God.

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Whatever happens, listen, conduct yourselves in a manner

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 worthy of the gospel of Christ.

230
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 This little phrase, "conduct yourselves," also, as Andrew told us in introduction,

231
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 is an unusual phrase, but it's packed with meaning.

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Its meaning is actually, "Act as citizens."

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 As citizens.

234
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 We are followers of Jesus, and we have high obligations as citizens.

235
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Citizens of what?

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Paul tells us straight up, Philippians 3:20, that our citizenship is in heaven.

237
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Ultimately, that's where we belong.

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 That's going to be our eternal home when someday this earth is restored

239
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 and renewed by God.

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And so, as we live right now in 2021, not knowing what's going to come

241
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 in the future with lots of uncertainty, maybe a bit of anxiety,

242
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 as we go about our lives filled with work, relationships, engagements,

243
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 children, marriage, birthday, death, migration, whatever happens,

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 we cannot forget, first and foremost, who we are.

245
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And we are citizens of heaven, which means there's a certain way

246
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 we have been called to act, to treat each other, to conduct ourselves.

247
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 A way that looks far different from the rest of this world.

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 All right, that sounds like a lot of pressure, right?

249
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 How are we supposed to do this?

250
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Well, here's the thing.

251
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 If you try and do this by yourself, it's not going to work.

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 You can't do this by yourself.

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And maybe more importantly, you're not supposed to do this by yourself.

254
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 This is why Paul goes on to say, listen, "Stand firm in one spirit,

255
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 striving together as one for the faith of the gospel."

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Now, a curious thing about human beings is often we are much braver

257
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 and more courageous when we are with other people.

258
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 And of course, many times this works itself out in bad ways.

259
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 I remember when I was at school by myself, and maybe other school teachers

260
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 will attest to this as well, by myself I was generally quite a well-behaved,

261
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 believe it or not, student, right?

262
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Generally quite well-behaved.

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 But if you brought a group of us boys together,

264
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 there was no telling what kind of trouble we could get into.

265
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 But this is a theory of crowd mentality where people collectively

266
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 begin to adapt the same ideas, which at times,

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 when they lose their minds together, leads to great destruction.

268
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 However, this can also work for the good.

269
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 For example, don't you feel a lot more courageous when we know

270
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 the people around us are willing to walk with us through the storms of life?

271
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 We get inspired to be better, don't we, when we see others acting

272
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 in noble, virtuous, and courageous ways.

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 A great example of this within our own community is how Branches of Hope

274
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 and the Chinese community have been working so well together,

275
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 two groups from very different walks of life coming together on the weekends

276
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 to go out and feed the hungry right here in Wan Chai.

277
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 This is exactly the kind of thing that Paul is encouraging the church

278
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 in Philippi to do and encouraging us to do today.

279
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Stand firm in one spirit.

280
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 It means to have the same heart and to be of the same mind.

281
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And the metaphor Paul is going for here is like a great sports team,

282
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 everyone working together to win the game.

283
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Well, maybe let me put it this way.

284
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 The Christian journey, church, your discipleship, your path to becoming

285
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 more like Jesus was never meant to be an individualistic exercise.

286
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 This is why the Scriptures refers to us as one body.

287
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 This is why we rejoice with those who rejoice and we mourn with those who mourn.

288
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 This is why the Bible says when one part hurts, every single part hurts.

289
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Think about this.

290
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 A few weeks ago when Bonner and his family, Colette and his sons from Africa,

291
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 are now going to be finally reunited in Canada together after 16 years of prayer,

292
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 16 years of praying and God finally answered the prayer.

293
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Now they're reunited in Canada.

294
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Even though it didn't happen directly to us, didn't it bring joy to this community?

295
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 This room was filled with joy and celebration when we found out that news.

296
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And didn't it inspire you and encourage you to have a deeper faith in God to knowing,

297
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 "Hey, maybe if God can do that for Bonner and his family,

298
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 he is such a faithful God, such a powerful God,

299
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 maybe he can do that too for the impossible things in my life."

300
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And we bless them as they go.

301
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Church, this is supposed to be a community, a family, a society

302
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 from where we can draw strength with each other.

303
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 This is how we stand firm together and it's an amazing thing.

304
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Psalm 133, verse 1 says this, "Behold how good and how pleasant it is

305
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 for God's people to dwell together in unity."

306
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 But what happens when we're not unified, if we're not standing firm together?

307
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 If we're not unified and if we're not standing firm, even when God does amazing things,

308
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 instead of leading us to rejoice together, it might lead us to be angry and jealous and bitter.

309
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And we look at situations like Bonner and think, "Man, why did he deserve that?

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 I've been praying for many years too. How come God didn't do that for me?"

311
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 And we get angry and bitter and jealous instead of rejoicing together

312
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 as Scriptures have called us to do.

313
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I think this is what Paul means when he says later on in the book of Philippians,

314
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 chapter 2, verses 3 and 4, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit.

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Rather, in humility, value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interest,

316
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 but each of you to the interest of others."

317
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 But not only, church, do we stand firm. Yes, this is calling us to stand firm together.

318
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 But it's not just to stand firm.

319
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 But also, it tells us in this next part of the verse to strive together as one for faith of the gospel.

320
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Other translations use the word "contend together as one for faith of the gospel."

321
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 So you see, standing firm together doesn't mean just standing in one place,

322
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 not doing anything, building a big cocoon, protecting ourselves.

323
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 But if we continue the sports team analogy that Paul gives us,

324
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 we're also to move forward and advance together as one team.

325
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And this team is not one that contends with titles and championships and rings or records or anything like that.

326
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 This is a team contending for the gospel of Jesus Christ.

327
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 This is a team that's advancing the good news.

328
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And the unity in this team is what's truly going to demonstrate the truth of the gospel.

329
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 The gospel message that Jesus, who loved the world, gave His life up for us on the cross.

330
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 That His blood reconciles us with the Father, opening up a new and radical way to live.

331
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 That on the third day, Jesus rose again and He's alive and reigning on His throne.

332
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Jesus, who told us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us.

333
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Jesus, who said a house divided against itself would not stand.

334
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Jesus, who said, "Jesus, who lived a life, lived by grace and love and mercy."

335
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And because of this, we owe everything, our entire lives, to Him.

336
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 This is the message of the gospel that we're contending for.

337
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 So, church, let me ask you this again.

338
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Do you see yourself as part of a team much bigger than yourself?

339
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Do you see that even as you come to Sunday service or as you tune in online,

340
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 other people who are joining us online right now, the people sitting next to you,

341
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 these aren't just random people.

342
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 These are teammates together with the same desire as you to advance this message of the gospel.

343
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And we have to learn to see each other in this way.

344
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Otherwise, the church, coming to church, these Sunday services, whatever you do,

345
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 will always be an individualistic experience tailored for you.

346
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It will always be about how God can make me feel better, how God can help me,

347
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 how God can bless me, how I can have a better relationship with God.

348
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 These things are good, church. It's fine.

349
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 You should have a good personal relationship with God.

350
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 But if you don't go beyond that, you're missing out on a whole lot of what God wants you to experience as a follower of Him.

351
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 There is so much more to discipleship, to being like Jesus in that.

352
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 You are part of a team, and this team needs you.

353
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 We need to be together in this.

354
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 But like I said, it's not going to be easy.

355
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 There's going to be things that come our way that will challenge us.

356
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 We're going to have enemies and other things that will try and oppose us and to frighten us.

357
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And there will be things that threaten to tear our unity apart,

358
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 which is why we need to stand firm and fight back or contend against these things without being frightened, as Paul says, in any way.

359
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 But this is the thing about fear, right?

360
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Fear will often try to provoke a reaction for you.

361
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 According to world-famous physician Dr. Marshall Mathers, when we feel afraid, our bodies react, right?

362
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Palms get sweaty, knees get weak, arms get heavy.

363
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 You might even throw up your dinner that mom made you.

364
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 The church in Philippi were facing some serious opposition because of their faith in Jesus,

365
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 and they had to decide how to react.

366
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 As a Roman colony, citizens were expected to give their ultimate allegiance to the Roman emperor.

367
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 He was seen as a god. Caesar was seen as a god.

368
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 In addition to him, there were many other pagan gods that other people worshipped.

369
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 In addition to that, there was a group called the Judaizers that were trying to force mosaic law and circumcision on people who wanted to join the community.

370
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And of course, in addition to all of this, were the spiritual forces of evil literally hell-bent on stopping the advancement of the gospel.

371
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 And so part of the disunity that was coming was in trying to decide how to react when the opposition was coming this way.

372
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Some of the church were wanting to give in and hide away from the dangers, and others were saying, "No, we need to fight on. We need to contend."

373
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 But how about us today?

374
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 What are some fears that we have in Hong Kong when it comes to advancing the gospel?

375
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 What kind of opposition do we face?

376
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 And the bigger question is, in the face of this opposition, how are we going to decide how to react?

377
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Our city right now, we still have the very precious gift of the freedom of religion.

378
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And so perhaps many of us haven't really experienced what it's like to be persecuted because of your faith, in the same way that Paul, the church, and Philippi were experiencing.

379
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 But just personally speaking, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried about that this might become a future reality for us here in this city.

380
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And we need to think seriously right now, how are we going to react if that ever happens to us?

381
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 That's a question we need to wrestle with quite seriously.

382
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 But like I said, right now, opposition to the gospel might not come in this way, but it might come in—it does come, even, in more subtle ways.

383
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 That can be just as frightening.

384
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Maybe it's like this.

385
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 You're in a very traditional, local Hong Kong family.

386
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And you're the only Christian in your family.

387
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And you know, the moment you go up to your parents or to your family, to your grandparents and say, "I can't worship idols anymore.

388
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I can't chong heung. I can't do incense anymore because I worship Jesus now."

389
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 You know that they're going to be so upset with you.

390
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 They might cut you out of the family and never speak to you again.

391
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Maybe in our culture right now, right, the idea that sex is something to be reserved within the boundaries of marriage is seen as something so prude and old-fashioned.

392
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Nobody lives that way anymore.

393
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And so you're afraid.

394
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 You're afraid that you'll never find a person to be in a healthy relationship with that will respect that ideal that you hold.

395
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And so you feel like you have no choice but to give in, even though you know that's not what's God's best for you.

396
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Or try telling individuals or businesses with heavy investments in countries where there's been forced labor.

397
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Tell them that one of the major global issues, gospel issues of today is the forced labor of people.

398
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And watch the angry, scornful reaction that you might get from them.

399
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Try telling people perhaps that God isn't yellow or blue, but rather He loves us all despite our political views.

400
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And we have indeed been called to pray for and know even to love those people we see as enemies.

401
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And in our fear of these things, right, our reaction too might be to give up, to give in, to abandon this relationship that we have with Jesus, and to stop talking about the gospel.

402
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Are you seeing now church why it's important for us to stick together in this advancement of the gospel?

403
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 In a community, you're not going to be the only one who's struggling with these fears.

404
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And when we see others around us standing firm, when we see our community encourage us to stand firm, we are inspired to stand firm.

405
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And when we stand firm, we declare that fear is not going to stop us from doing what God has called us to do.

406
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 By remaining united and striving together, we're demonstrating to the whole world that we are not afraid.

407
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And when we put on a united front, fear loses its power.

408
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Well then, okay, let's say we do this.

409
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 We stand firm. We strive. We work hard to advance the gospel. We conduct ourselves in a way that's worthy.

410
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Well then, of course, then that's how God's going to bring the blessings upon us, right?

411
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Then we deserve it. Then, of course, this is how we get blessings from God. This is how peace and prosperity comes for us, right?

412
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Not exactly.

413
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Follow Jesus. It's going to lead to suffering.

414
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Probably not the best selling point of our faith, but yet it's one of the most fundamental truths about a relationship with Jesus.

415
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Oh, we like the passages about God blessing us, right?

416
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 We love those passages about God giving us good gifts, protecting us, providing for us, and we should,

417
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 because that is the kind of God that we serve. I'm not shaming us for believing in those things.

418
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 We want God to lavish us with all that's good, to do for us immeasurably more than we can ask or imagine.

419
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And yes, like I said, God does love us. He does want to bless us and give us good gifts.

420
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 But that doesn't mean that life with Him is going to be sunshine and rainbows all day long.

421
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Paul ends this passage with these words,

422
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 "For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to listen, suffer for Him.

423
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Since you're going through the same struggle you saw I had and now hear that I still have."

424
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I mean, if there's anybody who was deserving not to struggle, not to suffer for his relationship with God,

425
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 for his work in the gospel anymore, surely it would be the Apostle Paul.

426
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 But he's still in suffering. In his letter to Timothy, Paul says this,

427
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 "In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Jesus Christ will be persecuted."

428
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Jesus Himself, the one we're trying to be like, the one we're trying to model our lives upon,

429
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 the one we're trying to follow in His footsteps, says it this way,

430
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 "If they persecuted me, they will persecute you as well.

431
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 In this world, you will have trouble. Everyone will hate you because of me."

432
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 So here's what I'm trying to say.

433
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 If we want to believe that Jesus is going to bless us and give us good things,

434
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 then we're also going to have to accept that suffering and persecution is part of our journey with Him.

435
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And of course, nobody likes suffering.

436
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 And don't hear me wrong. I'm not teaching us. I'm not calling us to go out and seek ways to suffer.

437
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 That's not what this passage is seeking.

438
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 But what it is saying is that suffering is bound to come sooner or later if we are loyal to Jesus.

439
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 So why do we spend so much time making our lives so cushy and comfortable to avoid any kind of suffering at all,

440
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 when perhaps suffering in the name of Jesus is a sign that we're actually doing something right for Him?

441
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Again, please don't misunderstand me. I'm not talking about all suffering here.

442
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 There is a kind of suffering that just comes from the fact that we live in a sinful and fallen world.

443
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Random tragedies that happen. People get sick. People die.

444
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Sickness and disease, tragedy, these things are horrible, and those things are not from God.

445
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 There's also the kind of suffering that comes from the consequences of our own sin.

446
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And those are just normal things that happen that you have to bear because of our sin.

447
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 That suffering comes in that way too.

448
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 But what I am saying is this.

449
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 As we work on our unity, as we push back the darkness, as we proclaim the gospel,

450
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 that is going to cause us to suffer because it's going to be out of step with the world,

451
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 and it's going to cause tension amongst ourselves.

452
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 But look at it in this way, as Paul teaches us.

453
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 This is exactly the kind of suffering that Paul describes God has granted, gifted,

454
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 is another way to translate this, us to walk through.

455
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 This is a gift from God.

456
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 What Paul realizes is that in the battle for truth, battle scars are going to be inevitable.

457
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And it's easy to take suffering for Jesus as a sign that something is going wrong,

458
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 to interpret persecution as a signal that God wants you to stop when exactly the opposite of this is true.

459
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 So here's the challenge, church.

460
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Here's the way we demonstrate that we are truly an alternative society.

461
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Here's how we demonstrate that the God we serve is the one true God,

462
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 that when persecution comes our way, that when suffering becomes because we are wholeheartedly devoted to King Jesus,

463
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 we as a church are unflinching, unmoving, and united.

464
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 We stand on the soldiers, church, of people like John the Baptist, or people like Paul and the apostles,

465
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 early church fathers like Polycarp, missionaries like Hudson Taylor and Liang Fa,

466
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 who was the first Protestant Christian in China,

467
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 preachers like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and many more.

468
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 These knew what it was like to stand firm in the face of persecution,

469
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 to inspire the communities to do the same.

470
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 And if the church is going to continue the work of advancing the gospel,

471
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 now it's our responsibility to keep on doing this, no matter what.

472
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 And finally, this is important because it's not something we can take lightly,

473
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 because the consequences of this are great.

474
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 It doesn't just impact our time on this earth right here, right now,

475
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 but rather there are eternal consequences to whether or not we act as a unified church in this way.

476
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Look back at this part of the passage with me one more time.

477
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Philippians 1, verse 18, the second part.

478
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved, and that by God.

479
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 The things we do on this earth, some of the things we do on this earth, have eternal consequences, church.

480
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And what Scripture is telling us here is this, that by the church working as one team,

481
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 not being afraid of persecution and suffering, moving forward, advancing the gospel,

482
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 it will serve as a signal to the rest of the world about what happens to those who are not on God's team,

483
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 who are not on team Jesus.

484
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 They might not realize it yet, but their fate, it says, is destruction.

485
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 And again, this is one of the hard truths we have to embrace.

486
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 The Bible Scripture tells us very clearly, anything that is an enemy to God

487
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 will one day end in death and destruction and eternal separation from God.

488
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 But for those of us on God's team, for those of us who remain brave and loyal to Jesus,

489
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 because-- brave and loyal to Jesus, it tells us that one day,

490
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 the whole world is going to acknowledge Jesus as Lord.

491
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 Every knee will bow, every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord one day.

492
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 And our result is salvation and eternal life with Christ forever.

493
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Paul realizes this, which is why in some ways, if you read through the book of Philippians,

494
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 he says some outrageous things.

495
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 He says things like, "For me to live is Christ and to die is gain."

496
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Because he knows for sure that his citizenship isn't part of this world.

497
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 He knows that even if he dies in his advancement for the gospel,

498
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 even if he gets persecuted to the point of death,

499
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 he gets the amazing privilege of seeing Jesus face to face.

500
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And so this is how God is using us at the church.

501
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 A unified church advancing the gospel is literally the way Jesus wants to use us to save the world.

502
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 People within the church are going to be encouraging each other to keep fighting the good fight.

503
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 And for those of us people out there who don't know Jesus yet,

504
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 they get to look at the church and this society and how it functions.

505
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 And they see people living in an alternative way.

506
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And without any confusion, they're able to say, "Yes, these people are Christians."

507
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 Look at the way they treat each other.

508
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 They're not like others.

509
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 They're always kind and honest and honoring.

510
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 This is a group that's remained firm even through the toughest of times.

511
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Anything you throw at them, it doesn't seem to faze them.

512
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 These people love each other sacrificially.

513
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 These people live with a quiet confidence that's unshaken by the scary things of life.

514
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 That's the team that I want to be on.

515
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 They serve a God that seems to love them no matter what.

516
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 That's the society that I want to be in.

517
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 So this is the prayer for us, church.

518
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 As a church, as Christians living at a time like this in Hong Kong,

519
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 we have an opportunity to demonstrate to the world there is a different way to live.

520
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Despite the hard times, despite the uncertainties, despite the things that we face,

521
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 there is a God that loves us.

522
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 There is a God that cares for us, who wants us to live in a different way.

523
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 So church, I wonder if you'd join me in standing.

524
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 And we're going to pray for this, for God to continue to shape us to be this community,

525
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 this society that He's called us to be.

526
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 So Jesus, as we talk about this, and I know even in my own heart,

527
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 as we think about these things, as we think about the topic of unity,

528
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 it's not going to be easy.

529
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 And I confess, even in my own heart and my own mind,

530
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 there are people who right now I'd rather not talk to,

531
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 who I disagree with so much that I feel like,

532
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 "I'd be fine if I never saw that person ever again,

533
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 just forget about them, I don't care what happens."

534
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 But Lord, you have called us to be different.

535
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 And amongst these wounds and these scars, Father,

536
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 yeah, at first I do pray for your justice to come,

537
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 but that's up to you, Jesus.

538
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 And our call as a society is to remain loyal to you,

539
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 is to encourage each other in this faith,

540
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 is to never be afraid to proclaim your love and your grace and your mercy

541
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 to a world that's hurting and who needs to hear this,

542
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 that there is a different way to live,

543
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 that on this team we serve the God,

544
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 the one true God who reigns over everything,

545
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 who is going to redeem and renew all things when the time is right.

546
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 But until then, Lord, help us to be a community, a society that loves like you.

547
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 Help us not to be afraid when opposition comes up,

548
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 to remain firm, to remain faithful to the call you've given us as followers of you.

549
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 I pray for every single one of my family who's watching this

550
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 and who's in this room right now.

551
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Bind us together, Lord, with your love.

552
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 Give us the unity that you've called us towards.

553
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 We pray these things in Jesus' beautiful and mighty name.

554
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Amen.

555
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Let's respond together, church.

556
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 We sing, "I see a generation."

557
00:40:43,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Sing that again.

558
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 I see a generation

559
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 Rising up to take their place

560
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 With selfless faith

561
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 With selfless faith

562
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 I see a new revival

563
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Stirring as we pray and see

564
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 We're on our knees

565
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 We're on our knees

566
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Hosanna, Hosanna

567
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Hosanna in the highest

568
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Hosanna, Hosanna

569
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 Hosanna in the highest

570
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 Hosanna, Hosanna

571
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Hosanna in the highest

572
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 Hosanna, Hosanna

573
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 Hosanna in the highest

574
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 You know, so much of what Ellison was talking about today

575
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 I think is significant for us

576
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 because the realities are that

577
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 often what happens when we're divided with someone else

578
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 is that those reasons for being divided run deep in us, go deep in us.

579
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 They kind of hook into us quite strongly.

580
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 And you know, here at the Vine, we believe in the power of prayer

581
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 and the way that prayer releases us from the things that bind us.

582
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 And maybe as Ellison's been sharing, you know, things have been resonating with you.

583
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 Maybe someone's hurt you and you're divided against another

584
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 because of something someone's done to you.

585
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 Or maybe you recognize that you might be the one that's done something to someone else

586
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 that's caused them to be divided with you.

587
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 And those things can run deep in us and are difficult to deal with.

588
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 And so I want to encourage you and challenge you to reach out for prayer today.

589
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 We have a prayer team in the upper house.

590
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 We'll have a prayer team here in the lower house right now as we finish our service.

591
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 And so rather than just rushing off, if you would like to just say,

592
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 "You know what I could do with some prayer today?

593
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 I could do with someone just standing over me and contending for the gospel,"

594
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 just like Ellison shared, that idea of contending with one another for the gospel in our lives.

595
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 Maybe that's something you value today.

596
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 We want to make that available for you in the upper house and lower house.

597
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 So do take the opportunity to come forward if the Holy Spirit is speaking to you.

598
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Let me pray over us as we close our service.

599
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 Father, we're grateful that we don't go through this life alone,

600
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 that we don't go through this life divided and not knowing how to reconcile the things that need to be reconciled in our lives.

601
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 Grateful that we have a God who chose for us to reconcile with us,

602
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 to show us the way, to model for us what we can do.

603
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 Lord, we're thankful that as we heard in this incredible passage that we're citizens of you,

604
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 that we have the same mindset, the same thinking that you do,

605
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 and that by that one spirit that Ellison spoke about, we can find reconciliation,

606
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 not just with God, but with one another.

607
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 So Lord, I just pray for those that need the counsel and the ministry of your Spirit,

608
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 that in this moment now, but also in the week ahead,

609
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 you would walk with them as they come into a place of liberation in some of the areas of division in their lives, Lord.

610
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 We pray for those that have, or you're calling to have the courage to walk out with the gospel,

611
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 like Ellison was sharing, maybe in their families or in their workplaces,

612
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 people that they need to just live out the gospel in fresh and new ways,

613
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 but the courage they need to do that.

614
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 We pray, Lord, in the week ahead that they would find that courage.

615
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 Holy Spirit, we're grateful that you lead us in all of these things.

616
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 And we just thank you for this in Jesus' name.

617
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 Everyone says, hey, can we give Ellison a thank you just to honor him and so appreciate that.

618
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 And remember tonight, eight o'clock registration for next Sunday, set an alarm on your phone if you need to.

619
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 If you want prayer, Upper House, Lower House will stand with you in prayer.

620
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Otherwise, God bless everyone. We'll see you guys next week. Thanks, everyone.
