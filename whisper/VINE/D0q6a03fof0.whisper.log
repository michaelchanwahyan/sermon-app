[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.700]   My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here,
[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.900]   and you're relatively new to the Vine.
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.300]   We're so glad you're with us.
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.900]   We're in week two of a four-week series
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.940]   on the topic of personal transformation.
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.540]   And this idea in scripture
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.980]   that one of the primary ministries of Jesus
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.400]   is to, through his spirit and his truth,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.140]   take us from the people that we are right now
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.940]   to the people that he longs for us to be,
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.580]   the people he's created us to be.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.220]   And we're basing this series in Ezra, the book of Ezra,
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.420]   and specifically this moment of pivotal history
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.580]   for Israel's people,
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.700]   where they've been taken out of their exile in Babylon,
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.580]   the 70 years of exile in Babylon,
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.340]   and now released by Cyrus, the king of Persia,
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.900]   to go back to Jerusalem,
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.140]   and they're standing there in the book of Ezra
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.660]   in the rubble of Jerusalem,
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.580]   where Jerusalem, some 70 years before,
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.740]   had been this glorious city.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.220]   The Babylonians had come in, pulled down the wall,
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.380]   destroyed the temple, 70 years in exile.
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.740]   Now the Jewish people,
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.900]   back standing in the rubble of the city they love.
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.340]   And as they're standing in that rubble,
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.420]   they hear the taunts of the enemies around them.
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.140]   And those taunts say, "Can you see the rubble around you?
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.800]   "Can you see how burnt out the stones are?
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.680]   "Can you see what was once glorious
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.580]   "now lies in ruin around you?
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.580]   "Can life ever come back to these burnt out stones?"
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.780]   And we said last week that for Israel, so for us,
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.140]   that there's things that lie in ruin in us,
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.100]   rubble that we're aware of in our own lives.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.020]   Perhaps something that's happened to us in the past,
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.020]   something that we're not proud of.
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.280]   Perhaps the mistakes we've made,
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.320]   or maybe mistakes others made to us.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.220]   Trauma that's embedded, hurt and shame,
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.060]   failure, pain, whatever it might be.
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.860]   But I think all of us can recognize
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.900]   that there's some things in our lives that lie in ruin.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.100]   Rubble that we're asking ourselves,
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.900]   "Can anything good ever come from this?"
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.580]   That we wrestle, don't we, with sometimes recognizing
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.900]   that we're not the people that we wanna be.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.920]   And we think, "You know what?
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.580]   "I can never be the person that I wanna be.
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.040]   "I can never be the person God wants me to be.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.500]   "'Cause I've got this rubble and this ruin.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.020]   "And have you seen it?"
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.900]   And if you could see it,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.380]   you'd know that nothing good could ever come from this.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.220]   What we saw last week in Ezra chapter three
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.360]   is this beautiful moment where the builders
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.380]   bring out the first stones to begin to rebuild the temple
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.140]   that had been destroyed some 70 years before.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.140]   And as they bring it out,
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.740]   there's this sense of that question hanging over Israel.
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.540]   Are you going to agree with the taunts of the enemy,
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.020]   see the rubble around you,
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.600]   and think nothing good could ever come from it?
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.140]   Or are you gonna get a new mindset
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.180]   and then recognize that there is that rubble,
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.780]   but believe that in the power and in the mercy of God,
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.340]   the rain that falls by the Holy Spirit,
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.860]   what was rubble in this moment
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.180]   can become a new building in the next.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.860]   And last week, I shared with you some ways
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.900]   in which I think God begins this process
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.500]   of personal transformation in our lives
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500]   in those areas that we recognize
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.180]   have that ruin and that rubble.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.720]   And I wanted to summarize four things specifically
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.220]   that we talked about last week,
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.160]   just to help you get a sense of where we are in this series.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.120]   And then we're gonna go from there.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.240]   Here's the first thing we learned last week.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.920]   Any process of personal transformation doesn't begin
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.760]   until we take an honest and sober look
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.440]   at the rubble that exists in our lives.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.440]   We must understand and own what needs to change within us.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.400]   No one has ever changed or transformed
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.120]   without first saying there's something inside of me
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.720]   that needs to change.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.460]   And it's a sober thing to recognize
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.060]   that there is rubble and ruin,
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.260]   not to try to hide it,
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.420]   not to try to pretend it's not there,
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.980]   but to say, "Lord, I recognize it,
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.140]   and I know I can't do anything about it,
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.420]   but Lord, I bring it to you."
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.420]   We saw last week, number two,
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.300]   that God's work of renewal begins in the rubble.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.740]   It's the very place where he does his best work.
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.580]   He doesn't remove our rubble, he restores it.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.060]   The beautiful thing that we saw last week
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.480]   that those first kind of stones
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.080]   that were laid by the builders
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.280]   were out of that burnt out rubble
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.640]   where people thought nothing good could ever come of that.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.320]   That becomes the stone the builders rejected,
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.160]   becomes the cornerstone.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.720]   The things in our lives that we think,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.600]   "Oh man, if only I could just get rid
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.360]   of all of that gunk and stuff."
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.960]   That's the stuff that God's playground.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.800]   He looks at that stuff in your life,
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.360]   he rolls up his sleeves and says,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.080]   "Come on, we're gonna do something
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.820]   with what you thought could never be transformed or renewed."
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   Thirdly, we saw this last week,
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.600]   as Christians, worship must begin a process
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.880]   of transformation, not just complete it.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.080]   When we are in the rubble,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.720]   our worship should focus on the character of God
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.200]   over the circumstance of the world.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.800]   We often worship as a response,
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.560]   worship out of the overflow
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.800]   or the outcome of something God's done.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.120]   God's answered that prayer, he's come through for me,
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.000]   he's done that miracle, out of that I find worship.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.320]   And that's absolutely right,
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.280]   we should worship out of outcome.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.220]   But what we see in Ezra chapter three
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.080]   is that the Jewish people, the Israelites,
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.720]   began worship long before they saw an outcome.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.000]   They lay the foundations of the stone
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.580]   through this act of worship, giving praise and glory,
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.300]   not because of what they can see with their eyes,
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.080]   not because of some thing that they're expecting God
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.540]   to do in the future, they praise for the character of God
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.100]   over the circumstance they find themselves in.
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.860]   And every move of personal transformation in your life
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.940]   will happen as we shift towards this worship
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.260]   of his character over our circumstance.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.460]   Not an easy thing to do,
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.540]   but something glorious when we do it.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.620]   And here's the fourth thing, we said this,
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.380]   we must understand that God's renewal takes time.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.580]   It is a journey of many small, obedient decisions
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.700]   within a much larger framework
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.520]   of God's purposes in our lives.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.180]   We would love a magic wand to be waved
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.260]   and suddenly that trauma goes, but the reality is,
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.620]   so often it's those small little steps
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.060]   that we take each day when we stay obedient
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.180]   to the thing that God's called us in our lives,
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.700]   that God shapes a masterpiece over time.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.180]   Some of the most important things
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.740]   that God will ever do in your life,
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.100]   it's gonna take some time.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.500]   And sometimes opening ourselves up
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.460]   to the journey of that process is primary
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.500]   in this season of transformation in our lives.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.660]   So that was last week, if you weren't here last week,
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.140]   you can jump back online, you can hear it,
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.420]   or you can just take a photo of that slide
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.180]   and go, I've got it, all right?
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.220]   So last week, we focused on this idea
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.140]   that personal transformation begins with this.
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.820]   Today, I wanna talk about, as we continue this passage,
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.420]   I wanna talk about the environment
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.740]   by which personal transformation truly happens
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.980]   and how we here at The Vine might be able
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.380]   to create that kind of environment together.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.740]   And to tell you about that, I wanna share a quick story.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.340]   In my early 20s, I worked for a recruitment company.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.740]   It was a headhunting firm,
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.540]   an international headhunting company
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.540]   that had offices in New York, in Hong Kong, and in Tokyo.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.380]   And it just so happened that when I was about 23 years old,
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.100]   most of my clients, most of my candidates
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.700]   were based in Tokyo.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.020]   So every eight weeks, I would have a business trip
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.460]   up to Tokyo, and for Monday to Friday,
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.660]   I would be in the Tokyo office,
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.180]   and I'd be meeting with my clients,
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.380]   meeting with my candidates and doing all that,
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.460]   then I'd come back to Hong Kong.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.700]   But on this one particular trip,
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.180]   the company up in Japan asked me to stay for two weeks,
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.860]   which meant that I was gonna, for the first time,
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.660]   stay over the weekend in Tokyo.
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.460]   And I had come to Christ about three years prior to this.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.620]   So I came to Jesus at university
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.460]   when I was in my early 20s.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.380]   Now I'm 23, I'm in Tokyo, I'm staying over the weekend.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.860]   And I decided I wanted to go and visit a church,
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.580]   not knowing anything really about the Christian context
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.060]   in Japan or about churches in general.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.220]   And you also have to remember,
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.500]   I'm kinda dating myself here,
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.940]   but this was quite a while ago, okay, when I was 23.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.980]   So the interwebs was not quite the thing that it is today.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.780]   It existed, okay, we used it,
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.180]   but there was no Google Maps,
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.820]   there was no kinda stuff like that,
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.380]   none of that existed yet.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.820]   So I did the smart thing,
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.260]   I turned to my Japanese colleague in the office,
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.940]   and I said, "Hey, would you make some phone calls for me
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.140]   "and find out if there's a church near where I'm staying?"
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.540]   And he's like, "Oh, Anjusan, Anjusan, okay, okay."
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.660]   So he makes some phone calls across the day,
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.620]   and at the end of the day, he comes to me,
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.620]   he's like, "Oh, Anjusan,"
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.300]   he goes, "I find a church for you."
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.380]   And I'm like, "Oh, that's great."
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.580]   He's like, "It's only a 10-minute walk from your hotel
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.300]   "where you're staying, fantastic."
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.820]   He says, "It's on the 14th floor
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.180]   "of this industrial building,"
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.260]   and he gave me the details, he wrote it all out for me.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.460]   So sure enough, on the Sunday,
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.620]   I think the service started at like 9.30 or 10,
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.620]   I can't fully remember,
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.900]   but I was there on time, got in the lift,
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.060]   I went up, the doors of the lift opened on the 14th floor,
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.780]   and I looked at what was in front of me,
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.460]   and I immediately began to think,
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.860]   I might need to fire my colleague.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.820]   In front of me was this old Japanese lady,
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.980]   beautiful lady, probably in her late 70s, early 80s,
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.060]   wearing a very formal Japanese outfit,
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.260]   hunched a little bit because of her age.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.140]   When she saw the doors open, her eyes just lit up.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.780]   She was so excited.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.220]   She's like, "A foreigner has come to our church.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.540]   "Like, revival is breaking out."
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.860]   And she gives me like this little brochure
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.460]   that was all in Japanese.
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.500]   She opens this door and leads me into this room.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.460]   I go into this room.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.940]   There's probably about 50 chairs in this room,
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.780]   a small kind of room, about 50 chairs.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.900]   There's about 15 people standing in the room.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.700]   As I come in, all 15 people turn around,
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.700]   and I immediately realize that the youngest person
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.180]   in that room, other than me, was probably about 78.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.700]   And they were all super conservative, old Japanese people.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.100]   And they all stared at me with eyes lit up,
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.260]   just like the lady at the entrance.
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.340]   And they all rushed over me,
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.660]   and it was that awkward moment when you're not Japanese,
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.500]   you don't know what to do.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.780]   It's like, do you bow?
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.100]   They're all bowing.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.620]   They're all welcoming me.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.220]   They're speaking Japanese.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.620]   I don't speak Japanese.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.860]   They obviously don't speak much English.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.460]   Super awkward, but everybody's being super friendly,
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.780]   super nice, and I'm like, "Okay, I guess I'll go."
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.780]   I can't leave now.
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.260]   That would be the worst thing ever.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.100]   See you guys.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.740]   Nice to, you know.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.460]   So I'm like, I'm stuck.
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.860]   Anyway, this guy, probably about 82, 83,
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.020]   he grabbed me and he pulled me down the aisle.
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.260]   He stood next to me.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.100]   He's like, "Oh, oh, oh, oh," you know, like this.
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.260]   And then worship started.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.500]   Now, when worship started, half of the congregation
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.180]   got up on stage, 'cause they were the worship team, right?
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.660]   So there was like six of us left, six on the stage.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.220]   They had like keyboardists and drummers
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.580]   and guitarists and singers.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.140]   Over the next 15 minutes,
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.980]   it's hard to describe to you that experience,
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.780]   but I would say it like this.
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.780]   It was very easily the worst worship
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.020]   I have ever heard in my life.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.100]   Like not just 23, but now that I'm 50, okay?
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.700]   The worst, the guitar player, he gets so old,
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.620]   he could barely fret a chord, okay?
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.220]   The pianist, I think, was deaf
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.580]   because they were pounding the keys as hard as they could.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.020]   The drummer must have probably been able to drum
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.020]   50 years ago, but right now,
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.700]   he could not find a rhythm at all.
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.620]   And I realized every single person had decided
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.700]   that they had a song they wanted to bring to worship,
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.060]   but none of them have talked to each other about it,
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.100]   and they're all just playing whatever they want to play.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.220]   And I haven't even told you yet about the singers.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.900]   They were terrible.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.740]   Like so bad, like couldn't hold a tune,
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.620]   couldn't do anything.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.740]   And I'm standing there thinking,
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.260]   this is the worst thing I've ever heard.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.300]   And I turn to the guy next to me,
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.580]   and I'm about to go like,
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.900]   (imitates guitar playing)
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.180]   you know, like this.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.420]   And he's like, he's like lost like 30 years.
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.420]   He's jumping up in the air,
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.740]   his arms are pumped up in the air,
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.780]   and I'm thinking, what is going on?
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.860]   For me, this is the kind of worship
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.660]   that makes Jesus not want to come back to the world.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.300]   It's the kind of worship that keeps Jesus away.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.300]   I don't want to be anywhere near those humans.
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.580]   But this guy's going like crazy,
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.340]   and he's shouting something.
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.180]   Here's what he's shouting.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.100]   He's going, he's saying,
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.600]   (imitates guitar playing)
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.660]   He turns to me, he grabs me by the arms.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.500]   (imitates guitar playing)
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.140]   He looked like really angry,
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.860]   like (imitates guitar playing)
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.180]   I'm thinking maybe, I have no idea what (imitates guitar playing)
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.560]   but I'm thinking maybe it's the name
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.240]   of the actual worship pastor
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.440]   who was sick and didn't show up that day.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.360]   And he's like, oh, Tenkuo Saku, where is he?
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.640]   I'm like, yes, Tenkuo Saku, I wish he was here too.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.120]   But he's screaming.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.840]   And the reason why I remember Tenkuo Saku
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.560]   is 'cause he said it like 100 times,
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.360]   top of his lung, Tenkuo Saku, Tenkuo Saku.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.800]   Monday morning, I'm back at the office,
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.520]   and I find my colleague.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.960]   And after slapping him around a little bit,
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.060]   I said to him, I said, can you define a word for me?
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.940]   I heard at this church this word, Tenkuo Saku.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.220]   What does Tenkuo Saku mean?
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.460]   And he's like, oh, this is interesting.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.940]   This is not a standard Japanese word.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.060]   It's not a word that I know,
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.220]   but it's a conjoint of lots of things coming.
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.620]   He starts to explain all this stuff.
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.620]   And he's like, it's like lots of different ideas
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.260]   brought down into this one word.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.860]   And I'm like, okay, well, what are the ideas?
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.620]   And he said, well, there's a shaking, a tearing,
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.700]   and then there's like the sky.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.680]   So I said, you mean it's like a shaking the sky?
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.040]   He's like, yes, yes, but also like tearing,
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.120]   wanting to tear the sky.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.920]   And I'm like, could it be like heaven,
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.360]   like tear the heavens, shake the heavens?
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.800]   He's like, yes, yes, yes, like shake the heavens.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.120]   It's funny, isn't it?
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.000]   How you can have, two people,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.840]   can have exactly the same experience,
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.640]   but have completely different reactions
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.440]   and perspectives of it.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.040]   I show up in this church with my baggage of worship
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.480]   that I had, which was the vines worship.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.480]   Oh yeah, great musicians, perfect sound.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.040]   Everybody in tune, actually playing the same song.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.020]   Singing in tune, the beautiful sense
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.180]   of God's presence among.
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.220]   I mean, this was me.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.460]   That's what constituted good worship.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.540]   Are you with me?
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.300]   So I walk into that room, knowing the baggage,
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.660]   having the history of that kind of worship,
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.700]   and I'm experiencing what I'm experiencing.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.700]   And I'm thinking, this is not worship at all,
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.020]   but the Japanese man next to me,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.480]   who maybe has never heard any other kind of worship
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.940]   than what was happening in that room.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.100]   Maybe that church always, that's just been the way it is.
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.500]   It's a bit of a free for all, but he's standing there
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.860]   and he's like, I'm not here to hear skillful musicians.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.660]   I'm here to praise the one that saved me.
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.900]   And I'm gonna stand here and go,
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.300]   take in new Osaka, rape open the heavens Lord,
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.140]   bring your glory to this earth.
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.820]   And I don't care what the musicians are doing
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.580]   and how it sounds, it's about my heart
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.340]   and honoring the one, even if we're not honoring him
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.180]   with the skills.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:28.580]   Rip open, shake open the heavens.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.020]   I, I wanted to run away.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.700]   That church, we're running in.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.640]   I wanted to weep.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.180]   They wanted to worship.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.740]   And as we get back to this moment
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.540]   that Ezra's describing for us in chapter three,
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.900]   as this incredible things happening
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.640]   with the rebuilding of the temple,
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:57.100]   almost exactly the same thing happens here.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.260]   And as we begin to unpack the reality
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.940]   of what is happening in these moments,
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.540]   I think we can see something quite profound
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.240]   that might help to shape our personal growth in moment two.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.700]   Let me read this to you from Ezra three,
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.540]   picking up from where we read last week.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.120]   When the builders laid the foundation
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.580]   of the temple of the Lord, the priests in their vestments
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.180]   and with trumpets and the Levites,
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.200]   the sons of Asper and the symbols,
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.520]   took their places to praise the Lord
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.100]   as prescribed by David, King of Israel.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.020]   With praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the Lord,
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.780]   he is good, his love endures forever.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.900]   And all the people gave a great shout of praise
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.700]   to the Lord because the foundation
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.860]   of the house of the Lord was laid.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.820]   Now listen to this.
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.660]   But many of the older priests and Levites
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.980]   and family heads who had seen the former temple
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.360]   wept aloud when they saw the foundations
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.180]   of this temple being laid.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.000]   While many others shouted for joy.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.780]   No one could distinguish the sounds of the shouts of joy
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.360]   from the sound of weeping
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.880]   because the people made so much noise.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.160]   Father, as we open this up for each person here,
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.600]   I pray that Lord, you would do something profound for us
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.780]   as we honor the reality of every person's story.
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.960]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.280]   One group of people, two very different reactions.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.760]   The whole group seeing the same thing.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.040]   They see the rubble of Jerusalem lying around them.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.360]   They see the stones being brought in
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.920]   to be laid in the temple.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.200]   Everybody seeing the same thing,
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.040]   two very different reactions.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.240]   On the one side, there are these older people.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.960]   Now, actually, Ezra tells us something
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.080]   really important in the text.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.680]   He says, they're so old, he doesn't quite say it that way,
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.000]   but that's my way of saying it.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.920]   They're so old that they actually had seen
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.840]   the former temple.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.920]   Now, remember the history here.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.040]   They were in exile for 70 years.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.240]   So anybody returning back to Jerusalem
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.760]   who was over the age of about 74
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.000]   in their early 80s into their 90s,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.840]   they would have seen the former temple.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.160]   Not only that, but they probably would have worshipped
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.400]   in the former temple.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.600]   And they would have seen this glorious temple.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.060]   There's an image here coming up behind me,
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.080]   which is just this beautiful artist's rendition
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.040]   from the Bible Society
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.600]   of what that temple would have looked like.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.120]   It was one of the most glorious architectural wonders
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.200]   of that ancient world.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.000]   And these people, these older Israelites,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.240]   Levites and priests and family heads,
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.160]   had, with their own eyes, seen the glory of that temple.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.760]   Not only that, but they would have experienced
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.660]   the power of God's presence within it.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.360]   Now, I wanna just give you a sense
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.440]   of what the power of that presence was like
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.040]   by reading you the short passage
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.720]   about the dedication of the first temple.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.000]   Now, this was years, years before.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.320]   Obviously, none of these people were there for that moment.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.000]   But this is the moment where Solomon dedicates the temple,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.800]   that temple you're seeing on the screen.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.600]   This is 2 Chronicles 7, verses one to three.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.920]   When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.680]   and consumed the burnt offering and sacrifices,
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.400]   and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.400]   The priest could not enter the temple of the Lord
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.760]   because the glory of the Lord filled it.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.440]   and the glory of the Lord above the temple,
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.840]   they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground,
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.560]   and they worshipped and gave thanks to the Lord,
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.160]   saying, "He is good.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.080]   "His love endures forever."
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.560]   So here's the interesting thing.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.760]   The older Levites and priests now, in Ezra's time,
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.160]   obviously, they weren't there in that moment
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.640]   of the first dedication of the temple,
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.920]   but 'cause they're the Levites and the priests,
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.920]   they know the story, they know exactly what's happened,
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.120]   they know what was happening,
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.440]   and they're now standing in the rubble of that temple,
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.960]   and they're weeping, and they're weeping because guess what?
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.680]   The people of Israel are singing the same song,
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.920]   but it's not having the same result.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.280]   Notice in the Ezra passage,
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.400]   as Ezra, if you bring it up on the screen.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.960]   Ezra said that the people sing the same thing.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.560]   "He is good, his love endures forever."
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.120]   And these older ones who know that that was sung
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.520]   when the first temple was laid,
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.000]   they're looking at this second temple,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.240]   and they're like, "Are we crazy?
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.880]   "Can you not see the rubble that's around us?
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.240]   "I remember what it used to look like.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.120]   "I remember in my mind the glory of this temple.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.940]   "I felt the power of the presence of God
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.180]   "who filled that temple up until the moment
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.160]   "that the Babylonians tore it down,
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.140]   "and now we're standing here, and you're going,
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.360]   "'Woo-hoo, he is good,' and they're thinking,
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.660]   "'No, everything is lost.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.300]   "'It's all gone.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.920]   "'This is not good.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.320]   "'We saw it before.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.960]   "'We knew how great it was,
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.440]   "'but right here, it isn't great anymore.'"
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.680]   They're weeping for what they have lost.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.360]   They're weeping, not looking forward and going,
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.740]   "Hey, here's what God's about to do."
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.400]   They're weeping 'cause all they can think about
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.640]   is what they've lost.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.860]   They're not in a situation where they're thinking
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.260]   about what they're about to gain.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.960]   They're weeping because of just all the things
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.280]   that they've already lost.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:15.120]   I wonder if that resonates with any of you here.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.960]   I know it does for me.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.220]   I know it's quite easy to think that my best years
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.660]   of my life are already in the rearview mirror,
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.260]   like those moments back in the old days.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.200]   Some people in my generation and above,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.700]   we have this phrase, if you're young here,
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.400]   it will annoy you, I'm sure, and you've heard it.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.660]   Many times, "Oh, in our day."
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.240]   Well, if only you'd been in my time.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.840]   In our day, there was no social media.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.180]   People actually talked to each other.
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.840]   It was great.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.960]   We actually had community in my day,
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.100]   whatever it might be.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.580]   We know what it's like, isn't it,
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.040]   to look back on the past with rose-tinted spectacles,
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.060]   to look back and go, "Oh, man, I remember those days.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:53.900]   "Oh, that was great.
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.520]   "It's not so great anymore, but it was awesome back there."
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.400]   We do this not just in terms of history and experience.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.040]   We do this in terms of relationships.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.920]   How many of us here might be honest and say,
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.160]   "Man, I wish my husband would be like he was
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.520]   "when we first got married.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.200]   "I wish my relationship was as romantic
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.040]   "as it was when we first started dating.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.740]   "Now it feels like my spouse doesn't even look at me."
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.980]   As humans, we have this tendency to always look back
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.280]   on the things in the past with these rose-colored glasses,
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.920]   kind of being selective about what we remember
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.400]   and trying to pull that to kind of say something
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.560]   about what it is today.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.080]   But when you look back and all your focus is
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.680]   back to the glory of something in the past,
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.760]   here's what happens.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.860]   You become blind to the importance
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.080]   of your presence in the future.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.280]   You just get consumed by all this stuff over here,
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.360]   and it stops you from actually moving forward.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.360]   See, in seasons of personal transformation,
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.160]   it's tempting to idolize the past,
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.980]   demonize the presence, and fear the future.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.100]   It's really tempting for us to do that.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.820]   And this is, I think, what the older Israelites
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.900]   and the priests are in danger of doing in this moment.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.500]   They're idolizing the past.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.020]   "Oh man, if you had seen that previous temple,
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.140]   "if you had seen the power that was there,
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.900]   "oh, and you think this is good,
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.140]   "you're worshiping to this?"
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.980]   It's like me in that church in Japan.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.780]   "Really, you guys, you're worshiping to this?"
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.460]   And there's this moment, isn't there,
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.900]   where we bring the baggage and we say,
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.500]   "Well, if it's not like it was back then,
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.860]   "well, it can't be any good."
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.140]   And the priests and the Levites,
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.180]   they're in danger in this moment of weeping
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.900]   from completely missing the new thing God wants to do.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.500]   And they're so connected back to the pain
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.820]   of what they've lost that they can't even see
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.620]   what they're about to gain.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.820]   Not only that, but I think they're also in danger
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:51.020]   of wanting to stop the others from building.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.020]   Like, "There's no point even trying.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.100]   "We can't get back."
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.300]   That was the glorious moment.
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.300]   That was the great temple.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.100]   Look, just put your tools down.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.500]   There's no spirit here.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.940]   There's no power here.
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.980]   Let's just give up.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.100]   We're just singing words without anything.
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.580]   They're in danger of allowing the missing
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.820]   of the thing in the past to actually begin to say,
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.660]   "We're not even gonna bother
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.300]   "to move forward with the present."
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:18.660]   See, when you allow the grief of your past
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.500]   to continue to speak louder to you
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.100]   than the hope of your future,
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.620]   you are always going to end up in a situation
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.580]   where you're likely to resist and to not embrace
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.420]   the very transformation that God wants to do in your life.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:36.100]   And in this moment, I think this is where
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.300]   these older people are, two feet here,
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:45.300]   and God's here saying, "Watch what I'm about to do."
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:49.380]   But we can actually resist the transformation
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.060]   God wants to bring us.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.500]   If we're trying to get ourselves back
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.260]   to an old version of ourselves.
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.300]   The Hebrew word for restoration in Scripture
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.620]   is not go back.
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.580]   You know, like you think about it with a car.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.660]   What is it like to restore an old car?
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.940]   The idea is to make it look as good as it did originally.
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.420]   That's not the Hebrew word.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.500]   Restoration in Scripture is not about trying
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.100]   to get you back to the perfect image
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.300]   of the thing in the past.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.580]   It's actually about taking you forward to the new thing.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.460]   Paul would say, "Anybody who's in Christ Jesus is what?
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.620]   "A new creation.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.860]   "The old is gone.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.100]   "The new has come."
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.220]   But here's the older people in Israel,
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.020]   and they're weeping for what has been lost
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.820]   when God's saying, "Can't you see what you're about to gain?"
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.580]   Now, stay with me for a second,
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:37.580]   because I'm not saying that weeping is wrong.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.420]   I'm not saying that mourning is bad,
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.060]   that we shouldn't feel emotions and hurt and pain,
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.300]   and we shouldn't pray.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.500]   In fact, it's completely the opposite of that.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.820]   Scripture has so much to say about the wonder
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.420]   of what it is for us humans to feel and have emotion
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.220]   and to know pain and to know trauma
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.380]   and to have to try to process it.
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.820]   Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.100]   Matthew 5:4, says to everybody around him,
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.980]   he said, "Blessed are those who mourn,
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.180]   "for they will be comforted."
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.740]   In other words, it's okay to have pain.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.660]   It's okay to look back and go,
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.100]   "Man, that was something great there that I've lost."
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.380]   It's all right to feel the disappointment and the hurt.
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.940]   In fact, the Christian religion
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.340]   is one of the most beautiful religions,
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.100]   because rather than trying to simply explain our suffering,
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.820]   the Christian religion has a God
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.940]   who joins us in that suffering.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.140]   That's a radical thing.
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.300]   There's no other religion,
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.860]   there's no other faith in the world where that happens,
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.140]   where God will come and be a part of the pain
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.900]   and the suffering of this world.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.180]   Jesus himself weeps out loud, bitterly,
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.580]   when his best friend, Lazarus, dies.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.300]   He feels the pain, and he doesn't try to hide it.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.900]   Even though he knows he's about to bring him back to life.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.220]   Hit your head around that one for a moment.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.620]   He weeps in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.780]   knowing the weight of what it's going to be
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.060]   to take the sin of the world on his shoulders
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.260]   in a desperate cry before his father,
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.660]   if there's any other way,
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.300]   and he weeps and weeps in that moment,
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.820]   and yet he knows that the Lord, his father,
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.340]   is still going to be glorified.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.620]   He knows the victory's there,
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.700]   but he still finds a place to weep.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.340]   This is the beautiful thing about our faith.
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:22.740]   In Jesus, we do not just have a God of the sufferers,
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.940]   we have a God who suffers.
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.900]   Come on, church.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.660]   That's a profound thought.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:35.540]   That means that in my suffering, in my pain, in my hurt,
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.100]   in the things that I'm holding in my spirit,
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.420]   I've got a God who understands that.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.180]   I've got a God who's not sitting on a cloud going,
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.580]   "Oh, yeah, yeah, you suffer, that must be hard."
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.300]   I've got a God who's walked in my shoes,
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.420]   knows that pain, felt it himself,
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.580]   worse than I will ever find it.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.620]   And so I have somebody to turn to
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.380]   who understands what's going on in my life
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.580]   and can meet me in the reality of the pain
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.020]   and the brokenness that I feel.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.820]   That liberates me to mourn.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.780]   That allows me to bring my grief.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.580]   This is why we have the lament Psalms in the Psalms.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.580]   It's why we have these beautiful poems
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.500]   where God's people say, "Why have you forsaken me?
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.660]   "Where are you, God?
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.820]   "Why have you left me?
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.820]   "Why have you gone?"
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.380]   And we begin to have these beautiful expressions.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.540]   And if I was writing the Bible and putting it together,
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.740]   I would have taken those things and left them out.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.580]   Like, "Oh, that's a bit harsh.
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.060]   "You can't speak to God that way.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.820]   "Let's just put that one aside."
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.500]   No, no, they're in the Scriptures to give us permission
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.180]   to bring our big feelings to God,
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.740]   to not bury them under the ground
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.140]   or try to push them away or pretend that they're not there.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.100]   We have a God who's joined us in our suffering.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.740]   Our suffering always has a place with him.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.460]   I don't need to run from it.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.940]   I don't need to hide from it.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.300]   Equally, though, I don't need to let it overwhelm me
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.740]   to the point where I can no longer see
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.540]   what God's doing in the midst of it.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:01.460]   You see, when we weep before God, here's what we do.
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:05.380]   We acknowledge our humanity and his divinity.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:10.420]   We proclaim through our tears, faith and trust
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.060]   that he alone is able to comfort and heal.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.940]   That's the wonder of what it is to weep.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.220]   That's the beauty of what it is to offer it.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.860]   And in this moment, yes, I do think that they're weeping
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.620]   because of what they feel they've lost,
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.340]   but I think there's a bigger point
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.860]   to their weeping in this moment.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.500]   They're weeping because they realize
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.540]   that they are aligning themselves to the pain
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.020]   that is on the father's heart.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.540]   You see, they're weeping for what I would argue
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.060]   is something called godly sorrow.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.300]   Gotta remember the history again.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.580]   For 70 years, they're in exile.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.940]   And during that time, they're reflecting
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.780]   and they're thinking about what happened.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.980]   And they're asking one critical question.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.820]   Why did the walls come down around Jerusalem?
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.780]   Why did the temple get destroyed?
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.020]   And the prophets and the artisans
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.980]   and the writers of the Psalms in that time,
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.180]   Psalm 131, by the rivers of Babylon,
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.900]   we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.900]   Their writers and their poets and their artists
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.980]   helped them to understand that the reason
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.500]   why they're in exile is not because God's abandoned them,
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.300]   not because God's turned his back on them,
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.740]   which is what they thought originally,
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.820]   but as they process it, think about it,
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.260]   spiritually God speaks in them,
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:28.940]   they realize they're in that place because of their choices.
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:33.860]   And the prophets begin to say, idolatry and injustice.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.420]   Idolatry in terms of how they were sharing their heart
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.580]   no longer with Yahweh, but with other gods and deities.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.460]   Injustice where through that,
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.460]   they were treating themselves and others around them
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.260]   poorly and wrongly.
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.460]   And because idolatry and injustice
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.260]   was so ripe in their midst,
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:53.460]   God brings the actions, the consequences
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.580]   to their sinful choices.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:59.060]   And I think what's happening here for the older priests,
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.660]   as they're standing in the rubble, they're weeping,
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.140]   not just because they feel like they've lost something,
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:09.140]   they're weeping because they realize this is our fault.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:15.300]   We did this, us.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.660]   And I think there's something happening in their hearts
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.940]   that is aligning them to the heart of God.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.740]   They're beginning to see sin the way that God sees it,
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.500]   and they're beginning to bring these tears of repentance,
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.580]   these beautiful, this is not the kind of tears of like,
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.820]   "Oh my gosh, I'm so bad, I've screwed up,
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.700]   "I'm such a terrible person."
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.380]   This is like, I see finally what God sees about brokenness
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.900]   and idolatry and injustice, and it is not right.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.740]   And it breaks my heart like it breaks God's heart.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.140]   And it breaks me even more 'cause I realize
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.220]   I was the one that did this.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.660]   And Lord, I weep because as I look at the rubble,
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.500]   I know that we brought the walls down.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:03.220]   And this profound sense of godly sorrow,
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.220]   not to beat myself up 'cause I'm the worst in the world,
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:11.100]   but a beautiful recognition that I finally agree with God
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.740]   and I know that he can liberate me,
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.900]   that he can forgive me and give me grace and mercy
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.740]   brings me to tears.
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.400]   Some of you here, it's really important you hear this,
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.020]   some of you here, your own journey
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.540]   and personal transformation will not begin
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.020]   until you actually have the courage to agree
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.940]   with how God sees sin and really, truly grieve
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.840]   its persistent presence in your life.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:41.660]   I know it's not an easy word, but that's truth.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.940]   Some of us, until we actually find ourselves
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.580]   like those Levites and the priests, man,
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.660]   I'm so sorry, Lord.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:56.100]   I'm finally admitting and owning that this happened.
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.380]   And Lord, I come to you because I have the courage
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.100]   to agree with you in how I see myself.
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:02.940]   I'm sorry, Lord.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:07.460]   But I'm not just sorry as in like, oh, I'm the worst.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.660]   I'm sorry because I know I don't deserve it,
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.220]   I don't understand it, but there is grace
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.900]   and there is mercy in you and you forgive me
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.420]   and when I know that I don't deserve your forgiveness,
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.500]   but you give it to me, it makes the tears come more.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.660]   And there's this beautiful moment
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.780]   where these people are weeping,
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.460]   maybe for the first time,
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.460]   and saying, Lord, would you forgive us?
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:41.540]   I love how the fact that Ezra takes that moment
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.620]   and he tells us that right alongside of it,
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.300]   there's a whole bunch of young people praising Jesus,
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:50.020]   praising the Lord, so excited about what's happening.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.140]   Both of these things are right in the same moment.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.980]   It was right for the older people to go,
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.060]   oh man, I've lost something.
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.940]   Oh man, we've done something.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.340]   Lord, we're sorry.
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.980]   But it was also right for the young ones to stand around
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.660]   and go, isn't he good?
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.660]   Isn't he great?
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.580]   He is good.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.380]   His love does endure forever
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.940]   'cause he's about to start a new process within us.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.340]   This starting point of weeping
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.420]   is the beginning point of praising.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.460]   As we bring weeping and worshiping side by side,
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.740]   something truly transformative begins to happen in our lives.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.460]   We truly begin to become the people
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.220]   that God has always called us to be.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:27.740]   This is the very soundtrack to what change is in our lives.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.740]   We often think that personal transformation is linear.
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.540]   I'm just gonna have a season of weeping, weeping,
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.460]   weeping, weeping, and then boom, I'm in eternity of praise.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.700]   The human experience isn't that way.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:43.860]   Our human experience is weeping and worship side by side.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.620]   Days where we feel great, days where we're struggling.
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.980]   Maybe even in the same day, moments of joy
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.900]   coupled with moments of grief.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.100]   And what we're seeing in this passage
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.140]   is when we allow that to happen,
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.940]   when we don't shy away from it,
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.420]   when we don't try to bury it,
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:06.020]   when we bring worship and weeping mingled together,
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.140]   something profound happens.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.620]   And the greatest moments of personal transformation happen
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.660]   when those two things are allowed to exist
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.460]   in our lives together.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:22.420]   Some of your greatest joys can only be formed
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.020]   out of your deepest pain.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.860]   Come on, church.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.300]   Some of your greatest joys can only be found,
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.940]   forged in you out of your deepest pain.
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.620]   When I was 32 years old,
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.820]   I received the diagnosis of azuspermia,
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.300]   which means that I am unable
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.340]   to father children biologically.
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.820]   And this was at the end of an eight-year journey
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.940]   when my wife and I were trying to have biological family,
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.980]   all the dreams that we had in our heart for children.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.380]   I've told this story many times.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.660]   But that was my deepest pain.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.700]   I began to second-guess who I was as a man.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.620]   I began to second-guess who I was as a husband.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.660]   I really struggled with not liking God in that moment,
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.380]   feeling like, why did he create me
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.900]   with a desire to have a family
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.580]   and then make me physically unable to do it?
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.340]   Like, is God some joker up in heaven
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.260]   who's just having fun playing with my life?
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:21.660]   I was in this place of darkness, deep hurt, and deep pain.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:26.180]   And in those days, I found it really hard to readjust.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.860]   But I can't even begin to describe to you what it was like
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.260]   the moment that my wife and I showed up at Mother's Choice
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.800]   and we met Mia, our adopted daughter, for the first time.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:42.180]   The greatest joy I have ever experienced
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.820]   in this little half-Nepalese and half-Indonesian,
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.580]   gorgeous little 16-month-old girl.
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.300]   And although I thought my family would be built biologically,
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.080]   God has built this family through other ways
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.300]   that are beautiful and profound.
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:37:00.300]   And my greatest joy, Mia, has come from my deepest pain.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.860]   And it's a wonderful thing.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:08.940]   Worship and weeping side by side.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:12.020]   And I love the way that Ezra describes this for us
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.260]   in this moment, 'cause I think this is really important.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:17.260]   Verse 13, "No one could distinguish the sounds
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.360]   "of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.300]   "because people made such a noise."
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.700]   Could you imagine the moment where you're before this rubble
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:29.140]   and everybody is either praising at the top of their voices
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.060]   or wailing and weeping at the top of their voices,
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.980]   and these things come together in such a way
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.540]   that they blend together and create this other kind of sound
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.980]   where you can't distinguish between the two.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.260]   One of the ways I would describe it to you is this.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.420]   Worship and weeping may be different notes,
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.340]   but they are found on the same scale.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.480]   And when they play together, they produce this unexpected
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.020]   but profound harmony.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.120]   That is the sound of restoration.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:04.700]   And could you imagine a community where both weeping
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.060]   and worshiping can happen as much as it happens,
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.260]   so much that it all blends in together
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.060]   so that no one stands out?
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.140]   I mean, I don't know if you've ever been
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.020]   in one of those church services, maybe here at the Vine,
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.380]   where you're standing around and suddenly someone next to you
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.660]   starts wailing their eyes out.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.620]   It's like, "Oh, that's awkward.
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.100]   "Oh, that's kind of weird.
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.560]   "Why is that person doing that?
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.460]   "I'm kind of uncomfortable right now."
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.420]   Or maybe you come into church here on a Sunday
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.020]   and you're feeling like, "Man, that was a tough week.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.280]   "Things are going really bad."
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.140]   Maybe you've just had some bad news and you come in,
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.260]   and the person you happen to sit next to you
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.340]   is the one who's the happiest and the loudest
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.180]   in their worship, and you're like,
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.540]   "Oh my gosh, Lord, I want to run away."
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:44.980]   When it's just one or two people,
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.780]   it stands out and feels awkward for everybody.
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.880]   But imagine a community where everyone has permission
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.160]   to worship or weep, where everyone can come to church
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.980]   with whatever's going on in their lives
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.100]   and go, "This is a safe place for me to let it out.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.380]   "This is a safe place for me to put my hand up
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.360]   "and say I need prayer.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.400]   "This is a safe place to weep
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.240]   "because there's some godly sorrow
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.500]   "that I'm wrestling with in my life.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.560]   "This is a safe place to praise as loud as I want.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.020]   "I can do it because everything is happening together,
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.540]   "whether in our gatherings like this,
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.780]   "in our small groups, no matter how it might happen,
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.960]   "there's such a cacophony of worship and weeping
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.260]   "that a harmony is created and everybody can grow
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:28.680]   "because they're welcomed, they're safe, they're loved,
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.580]   "and they can be just who, in that moment, they are."
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:34.860]   That, my friends,
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.340]   that, my friends, is worth a golf clap.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.460]   Nice par.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.800]   That, my friends, is church.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.120]   That's what I want the Lord to read.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.380]   So I'm gonna close with this.
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.360]   I'm gonna close with three ways
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.340]   that I think we at The Vine can actually invest into this,
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.960]   that we can make a space here for restoration and renewal.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.800]   Here it is.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.440]   Number one, we should always treat people around us
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.320]   with dignity, respect, and value.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.160]   Can I have an amen?
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.980]   - Amen.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.160]   - Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.920]   smelling really badly?
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.080]   Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.880]   really down and depressed and heavy?
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.580]   Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.260]   with a promotion that week, praising Jesus?
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.480]   Like, it's amazing that we can respect people,
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.220]   that one who sings really loudly behind you out of tune
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:30.140]   and you wanna turn around and go, "Who are you?"
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.260]   Isn't it wonderful that they can be here?
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.640]   Isn't it wonderful that the person next to you
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.600]   can wail and cry and you not feel awkward about it?
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.400]   Isn't it wonderful that you have a senior pastor
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.720]   who claps really loudly all the time
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.020]   and it really annoys you?
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.440]   Amen?
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.980]   - Amen.
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.120]   - Isn't it wonderful?
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.200]   - It is.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.680]   - That we can be together and be ourselves
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.960]   and not have to pretend to be anything else.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.840]   But that will only happen when we feel safe of one another.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.160]   And that will only happen if we give respect
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.840]   and dignity and value that every person here
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.080]   made in the image of God should demand from you.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.200]   Here's the second thing.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.760]   While our worship should be orderly and respectful,
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.360]   Paul writes about that in 1 Corinthians 14,
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.600]   we should not expect or force people to believe uniformly.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.040]   We should not expect people to put their hands up
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:20.920]   if they don't want to,
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.440]   open their hands if they don't want to,
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.600]   sing aloud if they don't want to.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.880]   We should allow space for people to express who they are
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.080]   and how they wanna worship in this moment.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.320]   Worship and weeping side by side.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.320]   The worst thing we could do is try to conform people
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.160]   to a certain way.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.680]   That doesn't mean we can't have good discipleship,
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.740]   we can't have metrics, we can't have culture,
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.400]   we have all those things, but our heart is to say,
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.360]   we're not trying to conform you to behave in a certain way,
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.320]   we're trying for you to feel like you can come in here
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.440]   and shake the heavens,
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.300]   and whatever that might mean for you.
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.360]   Here's the third and final thing.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.920]   Because the God we worship knows us
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.340]   better than we know ourselves,
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:59.720]   we should not pretend in God's presence.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.400]   And I think that's something that I think
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.960]   I struggle with sometimes, and I'm sure you do too a bit.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.240]   I'm just gonna shove that under the carpet,
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.840]   I'm just gonna pretend that that's not there,
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.440]   I'm just gonna like, I don't wanna embarrass myself,
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.880]   I don't wanna stand out.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.160]   So I'm just gonna put my hands up and sing,
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.080]   but I'm feeling like I need to weep.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.160]   Or I'm gonna praise, but the people around me
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.600]   seem like they're having a really hard time,
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.120]   so I better just calm down.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.280]   How beautiful it would be if we realized
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.400]   that in God's presence, because he knows us
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.720]   better than anyone, we don't need to pretend.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.560]   In his presence is the only place in this world
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.960]   where you are completely free to be who you are.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.800]   Everywhere else, in your workplace,
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.120]   in your family, in other places,
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.520]   you will find pressure to try to conform to something.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.960]   You do not need to conform in God's presence
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.240]   to anything other than Jesus Christ.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:54.720]   Imagine what that would feel like.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.120]   That would be a community of transformation,
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.760]   where people could come in here and heal and receive
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:08.760]   and have promises and forgiveness and life and celebration
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.840]   and together we would become the people
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.480]   that God has called us to be.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:19.080]   Takenu osaku, shake the heavens, Lord.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:23.760]   Would your power come down and change us, amen?
