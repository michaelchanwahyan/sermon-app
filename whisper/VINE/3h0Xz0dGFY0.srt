1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 Now, one of the most common questions when you go to a job interview

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,920
 is describe a challenge you faced and how you overcame it.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,480
 Now, I'm curious to hear who here has been asked that question in a job interview.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,240
 All right, so a few people. Okay.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,920
 Now, I myself, when I interview people, actually do ask that question as well

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,360
 because I want to hear what challenges has this person faced,

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,320
 how did they deal with them, were they resilient,

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,400
 did they figure out a way to solve the problem, are they adaptable,

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,000
 do they have a positive mindset about what's going on?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,640
 And there's also something telling when you don't have anything to share,

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,760
 like when there is no challenge that you can think of.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,120
 And so for me, that's one of the questions I asked.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,920
 But work challenges is one thing and they can be a major thing.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,840
 But what about all the other things in life, all the other challenges that we face?

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,480
 And I'm actually wondering what challenges you are facing right now.

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,600
 You know, what are some of the things that you are walking through that are not that easy?

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,120
 And how are you doing with coping with those things?

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,600
 Are you confident and you're like, yeah, I'm going to tackle this,

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,160
 you got that fight in you and you're dealing with it?

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:35,880
 Or has this thing been grinding and going on and you're actually worn out and tired?

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,400
 And maybe there's some despair with what's going on.

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,040
 You know, is there faith? Does your faith play a role in how you navigate this?

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,880
 Or even like, God, where are you?

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,000
 Like, what are you doing here? Why am I going through this?

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,080
 And so what I want to do with you in the sermon series, in this message today,

26
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,560
 is I want to explore with you the question, how do you respond to life's challenges and setbacks?

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,400
 You know, how do you do that?

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,240
 And we're going to look at what does God's word have to say to us

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,600
 about dealing with challenges and setbacks in our life?

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,760
 And how might he encourage us today and speak to us so that we can face,

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,320
 you know, whatever it is that we're going through, that he can give us some guidance,

32
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,120
 some perspective on how to go through that.

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,200
 And I want to also say, if you're not going through a challenge, praise God, right?

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,360
 That's awesome.

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,720
 But this is also, I think, helpful for as you help other people

36
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,200
 who are facing challenges right now to walk with them through that.

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,000
 So I think there's something here for everyone in this message.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,280
 So we're going to continue in our sermon series through the book of,

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,080
 or it's not actually the book of Genesis, it's the story of Joseph.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,400
 And so this is the fourth sermon in the series.

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,960
 And we're picking up at a point where Joseph's life is not working out

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,920
 the way he probably dreamed or hoped for.

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,760
 So he went from being the favorite son, who had privilege, who had position,

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,960
 who had a special robe.

45
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,920
 He went from that to getting all of that stripped from him.

46
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,440
 Like actually the robe literally taken from him, betrayed cold-bloodedly

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,840
 by his brother, sold into slavery.

48
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,080
 And so he's on the way to Egypt in a caravan.

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,920
 And we're going to pick up the story when Joseph arrives in Egypt.

50
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,480
 So let me take you to Genesis 39, we're starting in verse 1, it says this.

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,640
 Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt.

52
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,880
 Part of an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh's officials,

53
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,600
 the captain of a guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites,

54
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,480
 who had taken him there.

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,400
 The Lord was with Joseph, so that he prospered.

56
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,360
 And he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.

57
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,800
 When his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord gave him

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,920
 success in everything he did, Joseph found favor in his eyes and

59
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,640
 became his attendant.

60
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,960
 Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,600
 he trusted to his care everything he owned.

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,400
 From the time he put him in charge of his household and all that he owned,

63
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,080
 the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph.

64
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,800
 The blessing of the Lord was on everything Potiphar had,

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,720
 both in the house and in the field.

66
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,040
 So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph's care.

67
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,200
 With Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything,

68
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,760
 except the food he ate.

69
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:44,040
 Now, this is a quite impressive way that Joseph seems to be dealing with

70
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,960
 these adverse circumstances that he's in.

71
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,200
 And I don't know if you know these social media posts where people,

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
 like they post a picture and they say, caption this.

73
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,400
 Anyone?

74
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,560
 You've seen those, right?

75
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,440
 Are you one of the people who actually comments on that,

76
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,600
 who writes a caption?

77
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,880
 So if you picture Joseph's life right now, I mean, he's a slave in Egypt.

78
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,160
 He's in a foreign country.

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,720
 His life is totally not turning out the way he pictured.

80
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,600
 And we look at this as a picture, and we'd say, caption this.

81
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,840
 What caption would you write over his life?

82
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,760
 Is it like, the fall of Joseph?

83
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,240
 Or Joseph in the pit?

84
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,800
 I mean, those are the captions probably that, if we're honest,

85
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,680
 that we would write over his life, right?

86
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,000
 So it's fascinating that the biblical narrator,

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,920
 that he gives it quite a different caption.

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:55,320
 Cuz he says, the Lord was with Joseph, so that he prospered.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:02,800
 That's the caption that the narrator puts over Joseph's life at this point in time.

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,920
 Now, that's crazy.

91
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,200
 I mean, how we're supposed to understand this?

92
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,520
 He's in the most undesirable circumstance.

93
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
 I mean, he's in slavery.

94
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,960
 He's fallen low.

95
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,760
 How can this be true?

96
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,120
 And if you think of your own life, like when we're doing well,

97
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,240
 maybe we would put that as a caption over our life.

98
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,760
 The Lord was with Tim, when everything was working out perfect and well.

99
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,240
 But we wouldn't put that over those times when we're going through a difficult time,

100
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,480
 or at least not it would be the first thing that would come to our mind.

101
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,360
 But the narrator, he alerts us to a truth.

102
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,840
 And this actually goes back to the covenant promise that God has made with

103
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,560
 Abraham, with Isaac, with Jacob.

104
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,280
 And that covenant promise is now also true for Joseph.

105
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,800
 That the Lord is with Joseph.

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,600
 He has not abandoned him.

107
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,840
 He is not alone.

108
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,280
 He's with him, even in that darkest moment of his life.

109
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,360
 So the Lord was with Joseph.

110
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:21,200
 Now, the narrator also highlights something else that's absolutely fascinating.

111
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,000
 In verse three, it says, when his master saw that the Lord was with him.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,240
 How do you see when you look at somebody else's life that the Lord is with him?

113
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,760
 What does that life look like if somebody looks at you in your workplace,

114
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,840
 or in your home, even in your family?

115
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,720
 How do they see that the Lord was with you?

116
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,920
 That there is this tangible difference in your life that they can see that.

117
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,920
 And so part of her sees this in Joseph's life.

118
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,840
 And again, this is remarkable because he just went through this traumatic,

119
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,320
 difficult experience.

120
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,320
 But yet he's somehow carrying himself differently.

121
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,520
 That it stands out to part of her that the Lord was with him.

122
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,080
 I mean, he's observing him in the workplace.

123
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,960
 And there must have, so part of her must have been one of the wealthiest people

124
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,520
 in Egypt.

125
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,840
 So this is like a huge household.

126
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,960
 There's a ton of people there.

127
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,600
 And Joseph sticks out.

128
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,480
 Now we're told that one of the reasons why he sticks out is because everything he

129
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,000
 touches prospers.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,240
 So there's that aspect, but that is not everything.

131
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,160
 There's more to it.

132
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,760
 Joseph is seeking to honor the Lord, to give him glory with his work.

133
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,840
 Again, that's remarkable.

134
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,040
 It would be so understandable if he had a bad attitude, right?

135
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,240
 I mean, you just had this horrible experience.

136
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,960
 You're in a place you don't wanna be.

137
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,600
 You have a job you didn't choose.

138
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,000
 You just have to do it.

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,200
 And it'd be easy to just have a bad attitude, right?

140
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,160
 But Joseph doesn't have a bad attitude.

141
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,200
 He's carrying himself differently, and part of her notices that.

142
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,200
 And then we're told that in verse five, it says,

143
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:25,840
 you know that God brought prosperity to part of her in the house and in the field.

144
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,280
 So that means that every aspect of part of her business, he was flourishing.

145
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,440
 And the only thing he had to concern himself with was what he was gonna eat.

146
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,280
 Now that's an incredible employee, right?

147
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,920
 If you have somebody working for you, and the only thing you have to be concerned

148
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,160
 about is what you eat, because you know that person is gonna take care of what

149
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,200
 you need, what needs to be taken care of.

150
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,640
 And I don't know about you, but for me, when I think of my own life,

151
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,960
 and I just wonder, are people able to see that the Lord is with me in my life?

152
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,520
 Is there a tangible difference that they can observe in my life?

153
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,080
 I want that.

154
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,600
 I hope that.

155
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,280
 Probably sometimes, maybe not always.

156
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,520
 And what about you in your workplace, in your family?

157
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,320
 Is that something that people can observe,

158
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,080
 that the Lord is with you by the way you carry yourself?

159
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,320
 But let's see how things continue.

160
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,640
 So things seem to be going quite well, right?

161
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,320
 They're on the uppity up with Joseph, but let's continue in verse six.

162
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,680
 Now Joseph was well built and handsome.

163
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,960
 Now the Bible usually doesn't comment on looks that much, but

164
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,680
 in this case they do.

165
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,400
 So you know if the Bible says it's true, right?

166
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,920
 [LAUGH] So he must have been a good looking guy.

167
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,600
 And after a while, his master's wife took notice of Joseph and

168
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,120
 said, come to bed with me.

169
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,320
 But he refused.

170
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,360
 With me in charge, he told her.

171
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,520
 My master does not concern himself with anything in the house.

172
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,960
 Everything he owns, he has entrusted to my care.

173
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,160
 No one is greater in this house than I am.

174
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,160
 My master has withheld nothing from me except you, cuz you are his wife.

175
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,560
 How then could you do such a wicked thing and sin against God?

176
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,760
 And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, and

177
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,880
 he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.

178
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,520
 Now just think of this situation.

179
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,760
 Every day at work, somebody who is more powerful than you

180
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,680
 is trying to pressure you to go to bed with him.

181
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,400
 I mean, she's like super straightforward, right?

182
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,480
 Like it's kind of shocking.

183
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,440
 For ancient context, you would think they wouldn't do that.

184
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,160
 But they're like, hey, sleep with me.

185
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,880
 And we have to remember also the power dynamic.

186
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,920
 Joseph is a slave.

187
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,520
 He's not an empowered person.

188
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,640
 Yes, he's in charge of all these things, but

189
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,160
 he's still not in the position of power.

190
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,480
 So there's a huge power dynamic between part of his wife and Joseph.

191
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,440
 So there might be sexual temptation.

192
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,280
 We don't know.

193
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,440
 We're actually not told clearly.

194
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,760
 I mean, he is a single guy.

195
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
 Maybe there was that.

196
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,440
 But I think the thing that is there for sure is the pressure from somebody who's

197
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,440
 your boss telling you what to do.

198
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,520
 And then you have a choice to make.

199
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,680
 Am I gonna do what my boss is asking me to do?

200
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,040
 And then maybe I can get away, just stay in my position, stay okay.

201
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,240
 Or do I say no?

202
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,960
 And so we probably have experienced something like that in our workplaces

203
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,960
 where somebody asks us to do something that's not right.

204
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,520
 And we're faced with this choice, are we gonna do it to please that person,

205
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,600
 to maybe keep our job?

206
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,880
 Or are we gonna do what honors God, but there might be a cost to it for us?

207
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,880
 So again, it's like a very real life example.

208
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,920
 We also have these temptations in the workplace.

209
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,080
 We also have these pressures in the workplace.

210
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,720
 And what does Joseph do?

211
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,200
 Well, he says no to her advances.

212
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,840
 He basically shuts her down and he explains to her, hey,

213
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,200
 your husband hasn't trusted everything to me.

214
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
 I don't wanna break that trust from your husband.

215
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,000
 And then even worse, I don't wanna sin against God.

216
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,280
 I wanna do what honors God, what gives him glory, what gives him praise.

217
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,120
 But part of his wife, she does not take no for an answer.

218
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,400
 Every day, she's pushing him to go to bed with her.

219
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,000
 I mean, what a horrible, difficult work environment and experience.

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,920
 But let's see what happens next, and let's continue in verse 11.

221
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,720
 One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and

222
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,640
 none of the household servants was inside.

223
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,280
 She caught him by his cloak and said, come to bed with me.

224
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,880
 But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.

225
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,360
 When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,

226
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,560
 she called her household servants, look, she said to them,

227
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,200
 this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us.

228
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,600
 He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.

229
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,320
 And when he heard me scream for help, he left the cloak beside me and

230
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,640
 ran out of the house.

231
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,720
 She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.

232
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,840
 Then she told him his story.

233
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,320
 The Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.

234
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,880
 But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and

235
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,440
 ran out of the house.

236
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,520
 When his master heard the story, his wife told him,

237
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,800
 saying this is how your slave treated me.

238
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,960
 He burned with anger, and Joseph's master took him and

239
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,200
 put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined.

240
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,360
 So Joseph suddenly finds himself in the house alone with part of his wife.

241
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,840
 And apparently he's been trying to avoid that.

242
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,400
 Maybe she's cleared out everyone, we don't know.

243
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,280
 And this time, instead of even just proposing for

244
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,840
 him to come to bed with him, she actually tries to grab him, tries to pull him in.

245
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,520
 And then he again does the right thing.

246
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,360
 He flees, runs out, but the cloak is left behind.

247
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,360
 And then she cites a scream, and she calls a servant and she tells a lie.

248
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,120
 She doesn't tell the truth of what happens.

249
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,760
 She's covering up for herself.

250
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,600
 And also I think it's a way of getting to Joseph because he's not doing what she

251
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,320
 wanted him to do.

252
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,480
 And so it's interesting in how she tells a story.

253
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,800
 It's really twisted.

254
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,280
 The first thing she calls him this Hebrew.

255
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,040
 Instead of calling him Joseph, she gives him a label.

256
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,400
 It's a little bit like saying this immigrant, or something like that.

257
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,800
 Where it stirs some emotions for

258
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,080
 some people that are not positive towards a group of people.

259
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,200
 So she's doing that to try to win over some of the other people in the house.

260
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,720
 Then the second thing he says is that he tried to make sport of us.

261
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,240
 So it's not just like he tried to make sport of me.

262
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,880
 When she talks to the servant, she's saying he tried to make sport of us.

263
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,840
 Now what does she mean by that?

264
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:14,120
 It's like Joseph's attempt to rape me is really an attempt to mess with all of us.

265
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,600
 That's what she's saying.

266
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,800
 And she's trying to rally the servants behind her with what she's sharing.

267
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,000
 And then the husband comes home.

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,280
 And it's also interesting what happens there because she talks about

269
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,480
 this slave that you brought here.

270
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,040
 It's about who, so she's of course blaming Joseph for

271
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,640
 what supposedly happened, but she's also putting responsibility on the husband.

272
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,040
 It's like you brought this guy in our house.

273
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,000
 You're responsible for this.

274
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,080
 And then we were told that Joseph, he responds with anger.

275
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:58,360
 That's also interesting because who is he angry at?

276
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,120
 It's actually not clear.

277
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,120
 And so the biblical scholars, as I was preparing for the sermon,

278
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,800
 some of them believe that he actually didn't fully believe his wife.

279
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,640
 And the reason is because he didn't put Joseph to death.

280
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,200
 Cuz he could have put him to death.

281
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,800
 But he put him in prison, which seems like for his position and

282
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,280
 who Joseph was, a surprising move.

283
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,800
 And so there's some ambiguity around who did he really believe.

284
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,080
 But he had to do something because his wife makes this claim.

285
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,360
 He couldn't ignore it even to save his own face in front of everyone else,

286
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,040
 his whole household.

287
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,920
 Now just imagine Joseph's life.

288
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,280
 So he, because of evil of his brother, he's brought into slavery.

289
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,320
 He has these horrible experiences.

290
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,480
 And then now, just when things seem to be going better, he sinks even lower.

291
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
 It even gets worse.

292
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,800
 Now he's accused of something he didn't do.

293
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,200
 He doesn't have a chance to defend himself, and he is in prison.

294
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,320
 Now let's continue reading a story, and

295
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,080
 we're actually gonna finish here our section in scripture.

296
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,400
 So continue in verse 20.

297
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,440
 But while Joseph was there in prison, the Lord was with him.

298
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,120
 He showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warder.

299
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,800
 So the warder put Joseph in charge of all those in the prison.

300
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,960
 And he was made responsible for all that was done there.

301
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,840
 The warder paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care.

302
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,280
 Because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.

303
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:46,160
 Now this is again incredible because the caption over even this yet

304
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,840
 lower point in his life is again, the Lord was with Joseph.

305
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,880
 How can this possibly be?

306
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,000
 And then in addition to it, actually we're also told that

307
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,200
 the Lord, he showed him kindness.

308
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,240
 Now the word for kindness is actually a lot stronger.

309
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,960
 It's a lot richer than what it reads.

310
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,800
 It's the word hased, the Hebrew hased.

311
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,560
 It means loving kindness, steadfast love, tender love, faithful love,

312
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,440
 unfailing love, compassion, mercy, kindness, and loyalty.

313
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:28,680
 And so God is showing Joseph hased in this darkest moment of his life.

314
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,600
 He's shown him this kindness, this faithfulness,

315
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,840
 this loving kindness in this pit, in this dark place.

316
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,640
 That's incredible, that's amazing.

317
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:49,800
 And we wonder, no, there's one thing about theoretically affirming that.

318
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,800
 But there's another thing when you actually can feel that hased love and

319
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,720
 actually receive and know that it's true,

320
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,120
 that you are not alone, that God is with you.

321
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,120
 And so then we're again told that Joseph prospers,

322
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,000
 that he's put in charge of everything, he does an amazing job.

323
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,920
 The water doesn't have to worry about anything.

324
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,400
 And so that's where we are gonna leave off the story.

325
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:20,240
 But all of this, in the story there's two major temptations that Joseph faced.

326
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,920
 The first temptation is the very obvious one that we already talked about,

327
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,000
 putt of fur, whether it's giving in to work pressure,

328
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,080
 whether it was a sexual temptation, whatever it was.

329
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,920
 That was the one we already looked at.

330
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,040
 But I think there's actually a stronger and more powerful temptation

331
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,120
 throughout this narrative,

332
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,960
 the sexual scripture that we looked at that Joseph faced.

333
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,360
 And that's the temptation of despair.

334
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,040
 Now what do I mean by that, temptation of despair?

335
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,560
 Well, when you're doing what's right, what honors God, and

336
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,960
 then stuff just gets worse, and

337
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,040
 things don't turn out the way you hoped for, it's easy to despair.

338
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,520
 It's easy to get so discouraged.

339
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
 You're like, does it even make sense?

340
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,680
 Do I even wanna still follow God?

341
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,120
 Do I even still wanna do what's right?

342
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,280
 And we become hopeless, we become discouraged.

343
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,400
 So that's the temptation of despair, and I think that throughout this,

344
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,640
 I mean, this temptation is right there.

345
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,280
 And this brings me back to the question I asked at the beginning of the sermon.

346
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,000
 How do you respond to life's challenges and setbacks?

347
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,840
 What do we do?

348
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,040
 Joseph, he didn't just have one setback, he had multiple setbacks.

349
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,880
 And how do we handle that?

350
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,000
 I think it's so difficult to resist that temptation,

351
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,160
 just give up and say, screw it, forget it, whatever, I'm done.

352
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,640
 God, I've given you my shot, I'm just done.

353
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,680
 And then to be angry, and just to be frustrated.

354
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:15,240
 And I wonder, of course we don't have access to this, but

355
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,680
 I wonder what Joseph's inner dialogue in his mind was.

356
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,880
 God, I served you, even when you brought me into slavery,

357
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,520
 I was faithful to you, I did what was right, I did what honors you,

358
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,640
 even though it was hard.

359
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,280
 And then you bring me here and it's even worse.

360
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:38,520
 So we can only imagine what dialogue Joseph would have had, but

361
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,440
 we might know what dialogue we have, right?

362
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,200
 And some of us here, we're going through setbacks and challenges,

363
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,040
 and there's also this temptation of despair.

364
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:59,400
 The temptation to just say, I'm done, I don't have anything in myself anymore.

365
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,720
 And I don't wanna, we struggle to trust and

366
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:12,080
 believe that God is good, we struggle to trust that he's good.

367
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,520
 And that he means it well with our lives.

368
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,080
 And we're just at this point of being defeated.

369
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,160
 But there is some encouragement in this passage for us.

370
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,680
 And I wanna share two things at the story of Joseph.

371
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,240
 For those of you who are finding yourself right now in this moment of

372
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,880
 temptation of despair, to encourage you to hold on, to keep trusting in God,

373
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,120
 to keep walking with him, and I wanna share those two things with you.

374
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,320
 The first one is, I believe that God gives us integrity and character tests.

375
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:52,160
 I mean, Joseph went through some testing of what was in there.

376
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:58,200
 And the tests, I think they're not so much for God, I think they're more for us.

377
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:05,080
 That we even can see what's inside of our heart or maybe what's not there,

378
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,040
 and then what God's inviting us to go towards.

379
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,280
 Now we cannot always control what happens to us in our lives.

380
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,720
 Sometimes we make dumb choices or not smart choices and

381
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,320
 we find ourselves in difficult situations.

382
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,000
 But then still we still have to deal with it.

383
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,080
 And then other times things happen to us, like we didn't do anything, but

384
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,160
 life just happens to us.

385
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,840
 And so we can't control those things.

386
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,160
 But what we can control is how do we respond?

387
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,680
 How do we choose to respond to what happens to us?

388
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,400
 How do we choose to respond to the situation that way?

389
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,160
 And even if it was of our own causing, you can't change that now,

390
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,360
 it already happened.

391
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,840
 But how do you respond now?

392
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,520
 Are we gonna remain faithful to God?

393
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,880
 Or do we turn from him, blame him in anger for what we're going through?

394
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,720
 God allows you to go through difficulties because he wants to build a more mature

395
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,440
 character and faith into your life.

396
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,680
 He wants to build something more resilient, something stronger inside of you.

397
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:18,640
 Now James, the brother of Jesus, in his letter to Christians spread throughout

398
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,480
 the Mediterranean world, Christian communities, so James 1, verse 2,

399
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,240
 he says this.

400
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,960
 Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters,

401
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,760
 whenever you face trials of many kind.

402
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,720
 Because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.

403
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,320
 That perseverance finishes work so that you may be mature and complete,

404
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,880
 not lacking anything.

405
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,960
 So as Christians, when we face trials, it says here, and

406
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,160
 it sounds a little crazy, consider it joy.

407
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,560
 It's like, I don't know if that's usually our response.

408
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,520
 But I always wanna be clear what that not means.

409
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,600
 It doesn't mean that we have to rejoice in the evil thing that has happened.

410
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,560
 That's actually not what it's saying.

411
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,320
 What we rejoice in is who God is, who can take this evil thing and

412
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,360
 he can turn it into working something good into our lives.

413
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,880
 That's what we're having joy over.

414
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,400
 Big difference, right?

415
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,920
 I think so.

416
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,800
 And so we have this choice.

417
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,560
 Do we say yes to this refining work of God in our lives?

418
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,080
 Do we submit to it?

419
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,360
 Do we wrestle with God?

420
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,520
 Do we pour our heart to him, cry out to him, but stay engaged with him?

421
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,760
 And let him work something inside of our heart,

422
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,120
 a faith that is greater than we've ever had.

423
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,400
 Faith that is stronger, that is more resilient.

424
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,000
 A maturity, a character that looks more like Jesus

425
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,400
 than the one that we've been holding prior.

426
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,800
 Or do we go through this and

427
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:03,520
 just say we get angry, we blame God, and we don't engage in that process.

428
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,680
 And we're just frustrated, we're angry, and that's all we're doing.

429
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:14,760
 And I think we can all have sympathy for either response, right?

430
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,240
 Because difficult things are happening.

431
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,800
 But the story of Joseph really encourages us to lean in so we can experience and

432
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,960
 actually see God's goodness, that we can see God's faithfulness.

433
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,080
 That when we go through the refining process, that we can come through on

434
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,040
 the other end and give a testimony to what God has done in our life,

435
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,120
 what he has worked in our hearts.

436
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,200
 But you're only gonna see it if you're willing to go through it with God.

437
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,920
 Cuz just going through trial doesn't mean you automatically,

438
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,000
 God does something in you.

439
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,960
 It's when we're submitted to him, when we're wrestling with him.

440
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,200
 That's when he builds in that perseverance, that maturity into hearts.

441
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,360
 And so that's what God is inviting us.

442
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,520
 And we see that in Joseph.

443
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:11,560
 I mean, twice, going through horrible things, but yet choosing to honor God.

444
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,960
 And it's interesting, as you continue reading the story,

445
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,720
 now we don't see that in our section yet.

446
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,720
 But Joseph sees later on what God was doing.

447
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,920
 Joseph was faithful in the little things.

448
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,160
 He was faithful as part of his steward and administrating it and

449
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,120
 having, worshipping God through that job.

450
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,640
 He was faithful in the prison when he was entrusted responsibilities.

451
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,880
 And then later on, God is preparing him because he's faithful in the little

452
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,280
 things to later on be the main administrator,

453
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,560
 second highest ranking person in the Egyptian empire.

454
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,600
 To save, to collect food during seven years of plenty and

455
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,560
 then later on distribute it.

456
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,880
 But it's like it took this phase beforehand to work these things into

457
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,880
 Joseph's life so that he was ready for what God had for him for the future.

458
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,200
 And I wanna encourage you with that.

459
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,720
 We don't understand why is God working perseverance into our character?

460
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,880
 Why is he building a stronger faith and resilience?

461
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,360
 Now we don't know, but he has a reason.

462
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,320
 He's preparing us for

463
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,360
 something greater that he has for us to do in the future.

464
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:40,360
 So I want you to be encouraged that God is at work.

465
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,640
 He's doing something and he's gonna lead you to something better.

466
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,240
 Because you know him in a different way than if you were not to walk with him

467
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,560
 through the difficulty, so that's the first thing.

468
00:29:51,560 --> 00:30:01,200
 The second thing that we can learn from Joseph's story,

469
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,800
 if you're facing the temptation of despair is this.

470
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,920
 Joseph's story assures us that the Lord is with you in your trials.

471
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:20,920
 The caption over Joseph's life in this darkest hour is the Lord is with Joseph.

472
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
 That's amazing.

473
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,640
 And if you're a Christian, if you're a Jesus follower, this is also true of you.

474
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,880
 Like I said, when we're going through difficult stuff,

475
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,400
 most of the time we don't think of putting that caption over our lives.

476
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,440
 But the truth is that the Lord is with you and he's writing that over your life.

477
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,040
 You are not alone.

478
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,840
 He is by your side and he wants to show you his chassé, love, his loving kindness.

479
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,680
 Now many of you know part of my own journey.

480
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,080
 If you're interested, I'm not gonna go into all the details.

481
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,160
 If you're interested, you can listen to it.

482
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,120
 There is no other name.

483
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,400
 It was a sermon in the Longing for Healing sermon series last year.

484
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:10,600
 But I, now quite a while ago, I was left in my first marriage.

485
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
 My spouse left me.

486
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,600
 And I didn't see it coming.

487
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
 I was caught off guard.

488
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,600
 And it really, you know, it was like pulling a rug from underneath my feet.

489
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,600
 And I was a pastor at the time already.

490
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,600
 So theoretically, I know that the Lord is with me.

491
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
 But I didn't feel like the Lord was with me.

492
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
 I felt like the Lord had left me.

493
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,600
 You know, I felt like, I was like, and I even, I was like, Lord, I served you.

494
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
 Why is this happening to me?

495
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:53,600
 And so I was going through this dark, difficult, you know, time.

496
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,600
 And I wasn't, you know, I had stopped working as a pastor.

497
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,600
 I didn't have a home at that moment.

498
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,600
 I didn't, there was uncertainty about the relationship.

499
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
 So everything was falling apart.

500
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
 And I started meeting with a spiritual director.

501
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,600
 And just processing all that was happening.

502
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,600
 And it was just a lot of like just dark processing.

503
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:25,600
 And then about three months into all of this, he told me,

504
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
 Tim, do you see how much God loves you?

505
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,600
 And I was like, come on.

506
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
 What are you talking about, God loving me?

507
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,600
 It's like, no, so then he reflected back to me some of the things that I'd shared with him.

508
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:47,600
 And, you know, one of the things was that a family in the church that I used to pastor,

509
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,600
 that they took me into their family.

510
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
 So I had a home to live in.

511
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,600
 And I was just going to be undercover, you know, stay out of their way, not bother them.

512
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,600
 But they invited me into their life.

513
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
 I ate meals with them.

514
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,600
 I went shopping with them at Costco.

515
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
 Bought way too much things there.

516
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:12,600
 And so the spiritual director was saying, Tim, God loves you.

517
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,600
 You know, he's showing you incredible love in your circumstances, you know, through these people.

518
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,600
 And on my own, I would have not been able to see that.

519
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:30,600
 But so the caption over my life was, the Lord is with you.

520
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:37,600
 And, you know, Jesus in the New Testament, he promises us that right before he ascends into heaven.

521
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,600
 And then Matthew 28, 20 says, "And surely I'm with you always to the very end of the age."

522
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,600
 God promises us, Jesus promises us his presence.

523
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
 The Lord is with you.

524
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,600
 So whatever you're facing, whatever's going on, whatever challenge you're walking through,

525
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,600
 you might not feel like God is with you, but the Lord is with you.

526
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,600
 That's the caption, even over this challenging time that you are facing.

527
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,600
 This is the caption over your life, and that is the truth.

528
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,600
 Now I want to invite the worship team to come up.

529
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:19,600
 Now for those of us who are facing this temptation of despair,

530
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,600
 you know, where we're like, I'm just tired.

531
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,600
 I'm just tired.

532
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,600
 So I want to encourage you with those two things.

533
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:36,600
 The first thing is that God is testing you.

534
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
 He's working faith.

535
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,600
 He's working something in your life that is not there.

536
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
 He's strengthened you.

537
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,600
 He's making you more in his image.

538
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,600
 You reflect his character more.

539
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,600
 And that is preparing you for something that you cannot even know about yet.

540
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,600
 But maybe one day when you look back, you can see why you needed to go through this challenge.

541
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,600
 So be encouraged by that.

542
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
 God is at work in your life.

543
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,600
 He's working something into you, something stronger, something more beautiful, something more powerful.

544
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,600
 And the second thing is God loves you.

545
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,600
 The Lord is with you.

546
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:26,600
 He wants to show you his chassé love, his loving kindness, his compassion, his faithfulness in what you're going through.

547
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,600
 So I want to invite everyone to stand.

548
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,600
 I would just love to pray over you.

549
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:41,600
 If you are going through challenges right now, and you just want to express to God,

550
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,600
 God, I just need you to work in my life.

551
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
 I just need you to meet you.

552
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
 I'm tired.

553
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,600
 I want to invite you to stretch out your hands just in front of you, and I just want to pray over you.

554
00:35:51,600 --> 00:36:00,600
 Jesus, you see every single hand stretched out here right now.

555
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:10,600
 Lord, I pray that as we've thought today, that this truth that you are with every single person,

556
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
 that they are not alone,

557
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:19,600
 that this will not become just words, but you will tangibly people experience your chassé love,

558
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:25,600
 your loving kindness, your faithfulness in the challenge that they are facing, that they know you are present.

559
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,600
 So Holy Spirit, I pray that you make this love known in a tangible way,

560
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,600
 that they can see you, that they can feel you, encourage you people, Lord.

561
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
 We ask for that.

562
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,600
 We long for that.

563
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
 Holy Spirit,

564
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,600
 fill your people with your love.

565
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:51,600
 Lord, I also pray that you give perspective on what you're doing,

566
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,600
 that you're working something into people's lives, something beautiful.

567
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,600
 So I pray that you encourage my brothers and my sisters right now,

568
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,600
 that you are doing a beautiful work as they're holding on to you,

569
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,600
 that you're working something new, something stronger, something more resilient,

570
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,600
 something that reflects you more into their hearts.

571
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,600
 May you strengthen your people right now, Lord.

572
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,600
 And so Lord, I entrust my brothers and sisters to you, the challenge that they face.

573
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,600
 May you lead them through what is going on,

574
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,600
 and may they come out stronger, knowing your faithfulness, your provision, and your love.

575
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,600
 I pray all this in your mighty name, Jesus. Amen.
