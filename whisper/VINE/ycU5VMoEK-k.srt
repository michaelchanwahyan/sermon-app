1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 I'm so grateful for our worship team and so grateful for our incredible production team

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,400
 that have really turned this around.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,200
 We're standing right here in the auditorium like we are every Sunday, but this place looks

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,000
 completely different to what you would have seen last week.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,640
 And the team basically did that in 24 hours, just had to turn this thing around when we

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,120
 made that decision to go back online.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,640
 And so we just honor those guys.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,320
 Just so incredible how hard they work and how they're able to pull together all of this

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
 in this moment.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,200
 Well, I'm grateful that you're with us, whether you're joining here in Hong Kong or joining

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,240
 from anywhere around the world.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,200
 We're so glad that you're a part of the Vine family in this time and in this hour.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,680
 And we're starting 2022 in a place of hope.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,920
 And I know that the last week has been pretty crazy for all of us, and it has thrown us

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,840
 back into this church everywhere situation.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,680
 But I want to say today what I said at the beginning of our sermons last Sunday, and

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,240
 that God is in this place and God is in this moment and his closeness to us is everything

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,960
 we need in this time.

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,360
 And I believe it is time for us to dream again.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,160
 This series that we're starting, I believe, is prophetic.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,160
 And off the back of the week that we just experienced, even perhaps more prophetic because

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,280
 the dreams of God have been placed on our hearts.

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,040
 And as I said to us last week, it's not right for us to throw those dreams up on the shelf

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,640
 and put them on hold.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,760
 Now, of course, during this pandemic, we've had to adjust.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,840
 We've had to pivot.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,760
 We've had to understand what was going on with the virus and provide for ourselves and

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,960
 for this world in the best way we can to help us to survive and flourish with the virus.

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,840
 So some of us have had to, quite understandably, put some of those dreams up on hold.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,120
 And I said last week, it's all right for us to put those dreams on hold for a season,

31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,600
 but it's not all right if that season becomes a lifestyle.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,280
 And as we step into this third year of the pandemic, into 2022, I want to kind of shake

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,280
 off some of that kind of lethargy we may have fallen into or shake off some of those things

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
 that have been put on hold.

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
 And I want us to grasp them again.

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,940
 And I said last week that the reason why we do this, because God has decided to flourish

37
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:11,740
 the world through a partnership with us, with humanity, that he gives us his word and he

38
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,880
 gives us his dreams so that we might be his hands and feet.

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,600
 And it might blow our minds to think this, but God decided to use us, decided to partner

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,540
 with us in the outworking of his word.

41
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,240
 And scripture tells us that when his word goes out from his mouth, it does not return

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,320
 to it void.

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,000
 And there's some words, there's some dreams, there's some hopes, there's some visions that

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,920
 God has put on your heart.

45
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,560
 And while those may have gone on hold for some time, we got to grab a hold of those

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,720
 words again and begin to live them out in our lives.

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,000
 If we don't do that, we're in danger of stunting some of the things that God actually wants

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,960
 to do in our hearts and our lives, stunting some of the ways in which he wants to move

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,780
 in our sphere of influence.

50
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,020
 He works through us, his hands and feet.

51
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,680
 So it's time for us to dream again.

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,120
 And as we shift back to church everywhere, and as we prepare ourselves and do the best

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,080
 that we can in this city to stop a fifth wave from happening, we must dream into what the

54
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,340
 future of this city is going to look like.

55
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,200
 Last week, I began this idea of dreaming again by taking us to one of the great dreamers

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,720
 in the Old Testament, Daniel, and that powerful moment in Daniel chapter two, where he interprets

57
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
 the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar.

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,840
 I want to encourage you, if you didn't listen to it yet, jump online, check out last week's

59
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
 message.

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,040
 But I provided in that message five basic foundations for dreaming again.

61
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,040
 And these are on the screen now, the five things that we can do to start that process

62
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,320
 of dreaming again.

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,380
 It is to know that it's all a grace gift from God.

64
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,760
 It is to know that we need faith in the process of dreaming, that we got to have a community

65
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,080
 around us so that we can dream well, know that our response to the dreams that God gives

66
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,680
 us is always worship, and to know who our God is.

67
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,600
 That's so key, that we would understand who God is so that we know his power, we know

68
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,640
 his promises, we know his character, so that no matter what might happen in our present,

69
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,720
 no matter what might happen in the physicality around us, that does not shake the character

70
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
 of God.

71
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,200
 It does not change how we understand his purposes and promises in this world.

72
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,920
 And so through that, we then are able to dream again, to take those dreams, put them into

73
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,320
 action and begin to work for him in our world.

74
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,880
 And now in 2022, we need to do that more than ever.

75
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,480
 And what we're going to do this week and over the next five weeks ahead, is we're going

76
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,600
 to take one dream from scripture, we're going to open it up, and we're going to talk about

77
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,720
 it as a way of maybe giving us some ideas of how God might be causing us to dream again

78
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,240
 in our own lives and in our city.

79
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,120
 And I'm really excited that today we get to go to perhaps what is maybe the most famous

80
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,480
 dream in the Old Testament.

81
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,560
 It's the dream of Jacob and the stairway of heaven.

82
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,120
 Now before we open the scripture, let me provide a bit of context to the passage.

83
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,620
 This dream happens for Jacob in the most critical moment of his life.

84
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,800
 We know from Jacob's story that he's a fraternal twin with his brother Esau, but his brother

85
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,760
 Esau was born 30 seconds before him.

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,080
 And while that may not seem like a long period of time, that's like a lifetime when it comes

87
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,360
 to the benefits that Esau had over Jacob.

88
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,720
 As the firstborn son, Esau would get the birthright of all of his family's name, his family's

89
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,560
 power, prestige, and wealth.

90
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,880
 That whole inheritance would go to Esau himself.

91
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,560
 And as we track the story of the relationship of these two brothers in Genesis from chapters

92
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,520
 like 27 and onwards, we get to see how this relationship is.

93
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,960
 Esau and Jacob could not be more different physically.

94
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,900
 Esau is this big, burly, tough guy.

95
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,920
 He's a warrior.

96
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
 He's a hunter.

97
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
 He's hairy.

98
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,440
 He's larger than life.

99
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,660
 He's the sort of guy that everybody in those days wanted to be like.

100
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,620
 They wanted to be strong, firm, and hard, and the hunters of their family.

101
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,140
 That was Esau.

102
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,400
 Jacob was completely the opposite.

103
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,000
 Jacob was like this skinny guy.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,120
 He's kind of a little bit more like me, like a little bit skinny, bit of a mummy's boy,

105
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,440
 one that would rather stay at home than go out and hunt and gather.

106
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,120
 That was him.

107
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,140
 And Jacob, what he lacked in physicality compared to his brother Esau, he made up for in his

108
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,640
 mind, his intelligence, and his smarts.

109
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,320
 Jacob used his wit to try to get his place in life, not his brawn.

110
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,560
 And he did that through scheming and deceiving and lying.

111
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,840
 We know in Jacob's story that one of the ways that he tries to get himself to have all of

112
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,600
 the things that were going to go to his brother was by scheming and deceiving his father to

113
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,960
 giving him the birthright rather than Esau.

114
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,800
 And that moment shifts everything in that family.

115
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,720
 The father is so upset that he is schemed and deceived into doing this.

116
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,000
 Esau wants to literally kill his brother because of this.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,540
 And so Jacob's mother comes along to Jacob and says, "You got to get out of here.

118
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,540
 You got to flee.

119
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,920
 You got to leave this family because you're going to get killed.

120
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,960
 If you stay here, you need to go.

121
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,840
 Why don't you flee to my hometown, which is miles and miles and miles away?

122
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,040
 Go leave us.

123
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,080
 Go and start a new life there.

124
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,160
 Flee over there.

125
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,440
 Make that your home.

126
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
 Find a wife in that place.

127
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,360
 If you stay here, you will be killed."

128
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,560
 And so Jacob, in the fear of his life, in the lowest, worst moments of his life, decides

129
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,000
 in the middle of the night to flee his family and head out towards where his mother's home

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 was.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
 And we're going to pick up the story right at that moment where Jacob is fleeing and

132
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,440
 rushing away from the family.

133
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,080
 This is found in Genesis chapter 28, and I'm going to start for us in verse 10.

134
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,400
 If you're on Instagram right now, put it away.

135
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,480
 I love you.

136
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
 Put it away.

137
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
 This is going to be awesome.

138
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
 Let's check this out.

139
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
 Verse 10.

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,860
 "Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran.

141
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,800
 When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set.

142
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,080
 Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.

143
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,360
 He had a dream in which he saw a stairway or a ladder resting on earth with its top

144
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,320
 reaching to heaven and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.

145
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,620
 And there beside him stood the Lord.

146
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,800
 And he said this, 'I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac.

147
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,480
 I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are living or lying.

148
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,160
 Your descendants will be like that of the dust of the earth and you will spread out

149
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,680
 to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south.

150
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,300
 All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring for I am with you.

151
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,560
 And I will watch over you wherever you go.

152
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,540
 And I will bring you back to this place, this land.

153
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,760
 And I will not leave you until you have done all that I have promised you.'

154
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,480
 When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought to himself, 'Surely the Lord was in this

155
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,440
 place and I was not aware of it.'

156
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,820
 He was afraid and said, 'How awesome is this place!

157
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,960
 This is none other than the house of God.

158
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,200
 This is the gate of heaven.'

159
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,240
 Early the next morning, Jacob took the stone that he had placed under his head and he set

160
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,080
 it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.

161
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,920
 He called that place Bethel, though the city used to be called Luz.

162
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,520
 A few years ago, I had the great honor of visiting the country, Jordan, as part of the

163
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,320
 research that we were doing for our Exodus film series.

164
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,720
 Now if you're going to ask me what's one of my dreams for 2022, it would be to get our

165
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,240
 Exodus film series completed and get that released to us as a church.

166
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,280
 And I encourage you to pray for us as we still try to work at a right time to get to Egypt

167
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,080
 to do that filming.

168
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,000
 But a few years ago, I'm in Jordan and we're doing some of the research for the locations

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,320
 in the north of Jordan that we need to film as Israel prepared themselves to move into

170
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,360
 the promised land.

171
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,100
 And we found ourselves whilst we were there having a rare day off.

172
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,560
 And so we said as a team, what are we going to do on our day off?

173
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,020
 Well, it was pretty obvious we're in Jordan.

174
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,320
 So we jumped in a car, we drove three hours south and we visited Petra.

175
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,520
 Petra is one of the seven wonders of the world, one of the most incredible places that you

176
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
 can ever go to.

177
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,680
 If you're ever in, and I know this is probably annoying you because I'm talking about travel,

178
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,720
 but hey, if you're ever in a position where you're traveling in the Middle East, you've

179
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,280
 got to go to Jordan and you've got to visit Petra.

180
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,080
 And whilst we were there, we were just blown away by what we saw.

181
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,300
 The centerpiece of Petra is called the treasury, the facade of the original temple.

182
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,580
 And of course we can't travel there right now, but I can show you a photo that we took

183
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,580
 whilst we were there.

184
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,940
 Here's a photo of it.

185
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,900
 And as you can see, it's incredible.

186
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:14,020
 Just this amazing kind of structure that was created right there in the middle of the rocks.

187
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:20,740
 Petra is known as the Rose City on account of the red colored rocks in which it is built.

188
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,140
 It was actually constructed by the Nabataeans in the fourth century BC.

189
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,300
 And it was constructed there because it was right there on this incredible trade route

190
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,500
 that was happening in those days.

191
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,720
 And the facade that you see in this photo was the entrance of the main temple that they

192
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,180
 had in that city.

193
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:48,340
 Now, just like every temple in those days, there were only a few very special people

194
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:53,060
 that were allowed to enter into the heart of the temple, into the holiest place of the

195
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,540
 temple where the presence of their deity was believed to have dwelt.

196
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,420
 The common people, people like you and I, would never have been allowed into the heart

197
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,660
 of that place.

198
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:09,420
 All we were allowed was to stand outside and gaze in and do our worship on the outside.

199
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,420
 So the majority of the people that lived in Petra in those days would never have set foot

200
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,620
 inside that temple.

201
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:23,020
 Now the architects, when they were building this facade, did a brilliant thing.

202
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,020
 Because they realized that most people would never be able to set foot in that holiest

203
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,860
 of places, they decided to bring the holy place outside.

204
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,140
 So they decided to enable the people, the common people, to be able to see what the

205
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,700
 holy place in the temple actually looked like.

206
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,300
 Let me explain this by showing you the photo.

207
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,820
 If we put that on screen now, you'll see this again.

208
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,300
 So on the bottom half there, you can see the pillars and the little kind of roof of the

209
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,180
 pillars on the lower 50% of that facade.

210
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,660
 Okay, that was the entranceway of the actual temple.

211
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,420
 But above that, on the upper 50%, there is this beautiful other design.

212
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,780
 Now most people think that's just the full design of the front.

213
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,960
 That's not the case.

214
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,240
 That upper 50% is actually a mirror image.

215
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,000
 It's a construction of what the inside of the temple looks like.

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,300
 So that top 50% is basically the architects deciding to take the inside of the temple,

217
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,860
 where people would normally not be able to go, and put it on top so that people could

218
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,080
 go, "That's what it looks like inside."

219
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,020
 It's like the architects literally pull back the curtain in the temple, bring the holiest

220
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,140
 of places, construct it on top of the actual pillars, and say, "Hey guys, this is what

221
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,020
 you would see if you actually stepped inside.

222
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,600
 This is what the holiest of places looks like.

223
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,540
 Look and be amazed at this."

224
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,760
 I love that idea.

225
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,820
 Look and be amazed indeed.

226
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,040
 When Jacob receives the dream of the stairway to heaven and that random place where he's

227
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,060
 put his head on that rock, it's like God is peeling back the curtain and saying, "Jacob,

228
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,100
 I want you to see the world as I see it.

229
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:14,920
 I want you to see where you are as what is really actually happening."

230
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,460
 It's an incredible moment.

231
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,060
 And in verse 12, we see the power of this moment.

232
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,900
 Let me read this to us once again.

233
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,180
 He had this dream in which he saw a stairway resting on earth with its top reaching to

234
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,980
 the heavens and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.

235
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,380
 In this dream, he sees this incredible thing.

236
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,660
 It's literally like God peels back that curtain and says, "This is how things really are."

237
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,900
 Look, there is a connection between heaven and earth.

238
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,660
 He sees a stairway or a ladder and there are angels going up and down on it in this dream,

239
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,660
 Jacob's heavenly.

240
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,460
 Now, I want you to see something really important here.

241
00:14:52,460 --> 00:15:00,060
 This dream is not about Jacob having some stairway so he can walk up to heaven to meet

242
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,060
 with God.

243
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,420
 This dream is not actually at all about Jacob embracing the stairway for himself.

244
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:12,100
 In fact, in the dream and in the story, we never ever hear of Jacob going near the stairway.

245
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,580
 It's really important you understand this.

246
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,160
 The stairway dream was to communicate this to Jacob.

247
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,860
 The dream of the stairway was about God coming down to Jacob, not Jacob going up to God.

248
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,840
 It was about God coming down and deciding to actually meet with Jacob, which blows our

249
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,180
 minds that God would decide to peel back that curtain and say, "You need to know that

250
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,460
 I am the one who comes from heaven to earth.

251
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,140
 I don't stay up in heaven removed from everything.

252
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,780
 I'm not standing at the top of this ladder saying, 'Hey, Jacob, just come up here.

253
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,980
 And if, hey, if you can come up here, you can get out of that horrible stuff you're

254
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,820
 in and come up and live a better life with me at the top of this stairway.'"

255
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,700
 No, it's actually the opposite message.

256
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,940
 It's actually about God saying, "I know where you're at, Jacob.

257
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,060
 I know what's going on in your life right now.

258
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:07,340
 And I'm going to open up a picture, a vision for you to see that I come down to meet you,

259
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:13,600
 that the power and the spiritual atmosphere of heaven is not reserved for heaven.

260
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,760
 That that spiritual power and that atmosphere brought as it is by my angels is for the reality

261
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,220
 of this place in which you live, earth."

262
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,820
 This is actually why in verse 13, he says this, "And there beside him stood the Lord."

263
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,860
 Not up there at the top of the end of the ladder, but there right beside him.

264
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,820
 It was like God was kind of putting his arm around Jacob and saying, "You see this?

265
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,820
 This is how the world really is.

266
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,940
 I come and meet with you."

267
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,060
 And I can't think of a more encouraging thing for us to think about at the start of 2022

268
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,580
 and at the end of this week that we've all just experienced, that God comes and meets

269
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,580
 with us.

270
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,140
 In fact, we've just been celebrating this idea, haven't we, in our Advent series and

271
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,900
 in that season of Advent as a church.

272
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,700
 But I want you to know this, that Advent is not just a season.

273
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,580
 Advent is a reality all the time.

274
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,260
 That at the very heart of who we are as Christians is this beautiful thought that God doesn't

275
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:20,120
 remain distant from us, doesn't expect this distance, but instead draws near.

276
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,100
 And I think so often as Christians, we get this wrong.

277
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,900
 So often as Christians, we think that our faith is actually all about ascending to God.

278
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,060
 We think that our faith is about how do we get closer to him?

279
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,660
 How do we try to ascend up to his level?

280
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,500
 And when we think that way, it creates actually a work mentality in us.

281
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,780
 It creates a striving based on the law rather than based on grace.

282
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,860
 We begin to think, well, if I could pray better, if I could live a better life, if I could

283
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,740
 have a better ethic morality, if I could just be more righteous, if I could attend more

284
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,300
 church services, if I could do all these things, read my Bible better, maybe I would ascend

285
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,100
 to a closer place with God.

286
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:04,140
 The whole beauty of this dream that God gives Jacob is that no, it's not about your law.

287
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,660
 It's not about your striving.

288
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,620
 It's not about your works for righteousness.

289
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,960
 It's about my grace coming down to meet you.

290
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,700
 It's about me coming and being with you in this moment.

291
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:18,620
 And remember the moment of Jacob's life where God meets him is not when Jacob is all cleaned

292
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,780
 up and forgiven and a perfect person.

293
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,260
 It's right in the middle of the worst moment of his life.

294
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,740
 It's right in the middle when he's fleeing as a refugee from his family.

295
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,040
 It's right in the moment where his brother wants to kill him.

296
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,140
 It's right in the moment where he's left his mother, right in the moment where he's got

297
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,580
 nothing, literally so little that he has to take a rock and make that his pillow.

298
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,860
 That's the moment God comes and meets with him.

299
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,800
 And that's a word in season for some of you listening to this right now.

300
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,340
 Because you started this year and you're thinking to yourself, man, I'm a long way from God.

301
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,620
 You started this year thinking like, man, my life is so messed up.

302
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,340
 Like it's so bad.

303
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,180
 Like I don't even know how I could even approach God.

304
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,860
 And I want you to know that Jacob in the worst moment of his life, God peels the curtain

305
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,820
 back and says, I am right beside you.

306
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
 I'm not going to bungee jump you out of here.

307
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,680
 I am here right beside you.

308
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,100
 This is why there's this beautiful moment here in verse 16.

309
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,780
 Let me read this to you.

310
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,860
 This is Jacob's response when he wakes up from the dream.

311
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,460
 He says, when he woke up from his sleep, he thought, surely the Lord is in this place

312
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,260
 and I was not aware of it.

313
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,500
 Come on church.

314
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,860
 Surely the Lord was in this place and I was not aware of it.

315
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,660
 What a powerful thing for Jacob to declare that God was right there, even though he was

316
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,220
 and not aware of it.

317
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,120
 And I can't think of a better passage to sit over us as a church, sit over you personally

318
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,720
 at the end of this week, at the beginning of this year, as things have shaken again

319
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,760
 in our city that God most surely is still in this place.

320
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,640
 And I think it's very easy for us sometimes to be so overwhelmed by our circumstance and

321
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,400
 our situation and completely forget or be blind perhaps from being able to see what

322
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,480
 God is actually doing around us.

323
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,480
 And I think if there's something for Hong Kong in this hour, something for Hong Kong

324
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,940
 right now, it is this, that we could declare as a church that surely the Lord is still

325
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,760
 in this place.

326
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,120
 Even with what's going on with COVID, even with what's happening politically, even with

327
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,640
 all the changes that seem to be taking place, He has not left us.

328
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,760
 He is still here right beside us.

329
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,880
 And He's saying, it's time to dream again.

330
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,840
 It's time to believe and think again that my power and my spirit, that all the riches

331
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,880
 of heaven are not some distant place that I'm expecting you to ascend up to.

332
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,480
 No, it's about us coming here right now and being with you.

333
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:52,640
 See, the center of the Christian faith is not focused on us ascending, but on God descending

334
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,300
 with us in this moment, right here, right now.

335
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,440
 Surely God is in this place.

336
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:09,140
 But if you're anything like Jacob that night before he had the dream, perhaps you're feeling

337
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,440
 anything other than that.

338
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,400
 Perhaps you're feeling actually like you're in a nondescript place.

339
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,560
 Perhaps you're feeling like Jacob was kind of between places, having left one place and

340
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,920
 not yet arrived at another place.

341
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,640
 Perhaps at the beginning of 22, you're feeling yourself in a place where you're wondering

342
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,740
 what's next.

343
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:32,200
 Perhaps you're feeling isolated, feeling alone, feeling like you're in the middle of nowhere,

344
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,560
 a nomad.

345
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,040
 Some of you might be feeling that spiritually as you start the year, feeling like you're

346
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,440
 kind of between places with God, that you're not perhaps connected to him in the same ways

347
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
 that you've been before.

348
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,120
 Perhaps you're overwhelmed with what is happening around you and your family, with relationships

349
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:54,240
 in Hong Kong, in the world, and you're just feeling like you're in the middle of nowhere.

350
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,640
 It's as Jacob is in the middle of nowhere that God peels that curtain back and gives

351
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,120
 him that incredible dream and shows him that he is actually present with him.

352
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,720
 So much so that actually Jacob says something brilliantly here in verse 19.

353
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
 Let me read this to you.

354
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,440
 He says, "Early the next morning, Jacob took the stone that he had placed under his head

355
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,120
 and set it up as a pillar, poured oil on top of it.

356
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,680
 Then he called the place Bethel, though the city used to be called Luz."

357
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,400
 He called it Bethel when it used to be called Luz.

358
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,040
 Let me preach on this for us for a moment.

359
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,320
 The word Luz literally means to be separated or to be in departure.

360
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,120
 It means separation or departure.

361
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,960
 And there's no better name perhaps for where Jacob was in that moment before the dream,

362
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,120
 feeling separated from his family, having departed what he'd always known as home and

363
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,140
 was heading into something that he didn't fully comprehend right now.

364
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,780
 He was living literally in separation and departure.

365
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,600
 But he takes that place and he renames it after he receives the dream.

366
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,000
 And he renames it this, Bethel.

367
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,360
 Bethel means the house of God.

368
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,140
 So he takes the place that was a place of separation and departure, and he declares

369
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,240
 instead that it's actually the place of God's residence where God is alive.

370
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,720
 Verse 17, he puts it this way.

371
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,920
 "He was afraid and said to this, 'How awesome is this place!

372
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,200
 This place is none other than the house of God.

373
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,000
 This place is the gate of heaven.'"

374
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,560
 Notice that he says, "This place."

375
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,320
 Now, this blows my mind because get this, the place has not changed.

376
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,600
 The place is still the same place that it was before he went to sleep as it was when

377
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
 he woke up.

378
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,120
 It wasn't like Luz had changed at all.

379
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,420
 It was still isolated.

380
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,520
 It was still lonely.

381
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,920
 It was still in the middle of nowhere.

382
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,080
 There was still only rocks for pillows.

383
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,520
 What hasn't changed is the physical place itself.

384
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,300
 What has changed is Jacob's perceptive about it.

385
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,820
 He now sees something different.

386
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,020
 His perspective has shifted and changed.

387
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,420
 And I want you to know this.

388
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:07,000
 When God's spirit breaks into our lives, when God's spirit comes and works in us, the first

389
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,800
 thing that always happens is a shift of our perspective.

390
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,820
 We actually begin to see things differently.

391
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,520
 Even if the circumstance and the environment doesn't change, we begin to change.

392
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,880
 We've been transformed.

393
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,240
 We see things new.

394
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,120
 And so he looked at the very same place with all of his isolation, all of its separateness.

395
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,960
 And he says, no, for now on, this will be called something else because although it

396
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,000
 may still look that way, this is none other than God's house.

397
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 You see, for Jacob, the place of separation had become a place of connection.

398
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,960
 Luz had become Bethel.

399
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,840
 And this shift that takes place for him is not necessarily fully immediate.

400
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,000
 In fact, his life is going to get even tougher in the months and years ahead.

401
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,720
 In fact, it won't be even until 20 years that Jacob is reconciled to his family.

402
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,240
 So just because God shows up doesn't suddenly make his life perfect.

403
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,480
 But it does communicate this to him, that even in the place of Luz, you can find the

404
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,320
 reality of the comfort of God's presence, that God can meet us and walk with us and

405
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,680
 be with us even in that place.

406
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,720
 For some of us who are listening to this right now, here's the reality.

407
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,400
 You're looking for the stairway of heaven in all of the wrong places.

408
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,600
 You're believing that the stairway to heaven is some destination out there, that it's someplace

409
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,360
 away from your current Luz, that this place that you're in right now, that you're not

410
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,800
 enjoying, that it's hard for you, that it's difficult.

411
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,560
 You're thinking to yourself, well, my connection with God will get stronger if I was somewhere

412
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,160
 else than if I was right here.

413
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,920
 You think it's someplace else.

414
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,840
 If you can get out of your Luz, then you might be able to find God.

415
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,500
 Your Luz could be something like your debt.

416
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,480
 If I can just get out of my debt, then I can find God.

417
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,480
 If I can just get out of this relationship that I'm in, then I might be able to find

418
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
 God.

419
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,280
 If I can just get that promotion I've been dreaming for, well, then I might be able to

420
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
 find God.

421
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,680
 If I can actually turn this thing around in my family, I will know that I found God.

422
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,560
 If I can change my church, then I might be able to find God.

423
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:20,120
 We always think that our connection to God, our relationship with him is some other place.

424
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,080
 The beauty of this story is, no, God comes to the Luz.

425
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,000
 He comes to the place where you're at right now.

426
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,920
 If you're looking for a future destination to be the place where God is going to meet

427
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,600
 you, then you've got the mentality wrong.

428
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,800
 That actually God peels back the curtain for Jacob and says, "Even in your Luz, I am here

429
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,600
 with you."

430
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,200
 Not in some other place where you think things are going to be amazing, but right now.

431
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,800
 See, this is a great thing.

432
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:54,920
 God is always in the practice of taking the Luz's of our lives and turning them into Bethel's.

433
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,160
 That's what he does.

434
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,320
 He turns us into a greater place of intimacy with him.

435
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,120
 Even though many times the circumstance and situation may not change.

436
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,000
 Some of you need to stop thinking that your deeper relationship with God is someplace

437
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,180
 else than right here, right now.

438
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:21,640
 Surely God is in this place, in the hardship you're going through, in the suffering you're

439
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,720
 facing, in the grief that's there, in the difficulty of this moment, in the valley of

440
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,240
 the shadow of death, he is with us.

441
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,080
 That encouragement is there.

442
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,440
 And I know that in my own personal life, this is my testimony, that it has often been in

443
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,960
 the hardest moments of my life that God has broken in and brought his presence with me.

444
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,160
 Not always miraculously changed the circumstance, but met me within it.

445
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,280
 I remember the hardest night of my life was that night when my father passed away.

446
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,240
 I sat with him at his bedside for five hours, helping him, just him and me.

447
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,000
 And I felt so helpless.

448
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,920
 I felt like I couldn't do anything.

449
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,800
 I had prayed and prayed.

450
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,160
 And I just felt like there was nothing that I could do to comfort my dad in those final

451
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,400
 few hours of his life.

452
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,720
 And I remember even in that moment where I was kind of freaked out and I was so anxious

453
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,640
 and worried, that I still knew that there was the presence of God in that hospital room.

454
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,360
 I knew that he had drawn close to me.

455
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,200
 And there was this amazing moment where my dad and I had this kind of lucid moment together.

456
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,720
 And it really felt like, although the circumstance didn't change, that God was present there

457
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,480
 for the two of us.

458
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,880
 And just a few hours later, my father passed away.

459
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,240
 And I remember when that happened, I went into a place of shock.

460
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,560
 I went into a place of complete and absolute not peace and panic.

461
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,080
 And I was overwhelmed.

462
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,200
 But when I needed it in the moment, when my dad was present with me in those final few

463
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:00,040
 hours, I was able to be present with him because God didn't remove the lus, but met me right

464
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
 in it.

465
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,560
 And I believe that's an important word for some of you watching this.

466
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,000
 You want to bungee jump out of the bad thing you're in when actually that bad thing may

467
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,120
 well be the very place where God wants you to dream again, where God wants you to experience

468
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,880
 the reality of the power of his spirit in you.

469
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,600
 You see, God has created a stairway, not so that we would go up to him, but so that he

470
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,840
 would come down to us.

471
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,280
 And that stairway is always with us.

472
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,320
 And I know that because of this amazing thing.

473
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:37,920
 Some 1500 years after Jacob had this crazy dream, I want to read you what Jesus says

474
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,760
 to the people that are around him.

475
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,020
 This is from John 1 verse 51.

476
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:49,280
 Then Jesus said this, "I tell you the truth, you will see heaven open and the angels of

477
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,480
 God ascending and descending on the son of man."

478
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
 I love this.

479
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,160
 1500 years later, Jesus takes this vision that Jacob has and he says, "Guess what?

480
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,000
 I am the stairway.

481
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Guess what?

482
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,480
 You will see on the son of man angels ascending and descending."

483
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,840
 In other words, if you want to know what connects heaven to earth, it is me, Jesus.

484
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,440
 And our Christian faith is based around this beautiful idea that through Jesus's life and

485
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,200
 his death and his resurrection, from all that Jesus has done to pay the price for our sins,

486
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,160
 to be raised again on the third day, to be ascended now and to send his spirit to us,

487
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,680
 that Jesus and our relationship with him is the thing that now connects us to all of the

488
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,240
 power, all of the authority, all of the hope that there is in heaven.

489
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:44,000
 It can be on earth, not because we kind of strive to find it, but because in relationship

490
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,640
 with Jesus, it is given to us, not in our righteousness, but by his righteousness.

491
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,300
 Not in our works, but by his grace.

492
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:58,200
 He has come and he's given us his son, Jesus, to show us the way to our own salvation and

493
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,240
 life.

494
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,600
 And this is such an amazing thing for us.

495
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,020
 So for us, the house of God is not a place, it's a person.

496
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,180
 For us, the house of God is wherever Jesus is present.

497
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:18,220
 And because that's a reality, we know that no matter what is happening in our own lives,

498
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,980
 we can find the fullness of the power of God amongst us.

499
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:27,060
 You see, the idea of his spirit being on earth is not reserved for some New Year's Eve, one-off

500
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,900
 resolution, as if it's a moment like it was for Jacob.

501
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,780
 But because we now are in relationship with Jesus, that Jacob moment can happen every

502
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,480
 single day of our lives.

503
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,300
 That actually our Bethel is a daily spiritual reality, that we can know no matter what is

504
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:49,020
 happening around us, that that relationship with God through Jesus opens up for us the

505
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,160
 fullness of the work of the spirit in this world.

506
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,500
 The fullness of the power of the spirit at work amongst us.

507
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:02,220
 We here at The Vine, we are not a church that sees or believes that the spiritual gifts

508
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,520
 and the power of the spirit seized after the apostles.

509
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,880
 Here at The Vine, we believe that the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is

510
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,180
 now alive in us.

511
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:16,080
 We here at The Vine believe that that encounter with God's presence can be known in every

512
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,460
 moment of life, that we have access now to the fullness of the gifts of the spirit, the

513
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,980
 fullness of what God is doing here on earth.

514
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,820
 And as we start 2022, it's time for us to dream again.

515
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,540
 It's time for us to believe that the full access to the spirit of God and the work and

516
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,100
 the power of that spirit is available for us right here, right now.

517
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:44,460
 My prayer for us, I sense in me a rising hunger for this spiritual anointing, a rising hunger

518
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,820
 for supernatural work in this world.

519
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,820
 I'm tired of human wisdom.

520
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
 Perhaps you are.

521
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,820
 I'm tired of what I'm reading in the newspapers.

522
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,940
 I'm tired of all these different perspectives and opinions about everything.

523
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,460
 What I want is the supernatural word of God.

524
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,940
 I want the supernatural power of God to be seen in the world and seen in our hearts and

525
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,880
 seen in our lives and yes, seen in our churches like never before.

526
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,480
 If there's one thing that's on my heart to dream again for us here at The Vine is that

527
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,820
 every time we gather, whether online like this or in person in the room, that there

528
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:21,180
 is an in breaking of the spirit of God into the present right now, that healings happen,

529
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,180
 miracles happen.

530
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,460
 The word comes, people are transformed, people are changed, people come to faith, salvation

531
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,460
 takes place.

532
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,460
 Why?

533
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,460
 Because we're so special?

534
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:36,380
 Because surely in this place, God was present with us and we weren't aware of it, but we're

535
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:42,340
 dreaming and we're praying and we're believing that God will peel back the curtain this year,

536
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,620
 that he will show us that it is all happening around us and that in that we will find a

537
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,820
 place of great joy.

538
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,700
 And what better way to lean into this than our fast that starts tomorrow?

539
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:01,020
 I want to encourage you to make your fast your ability to shake off the lust mindset,

540
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,300
 that mindset that says, I got to be somewhere else.

541
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,700
 Oh, if only I got X, Y, and Z in place, then I can restore my relationship with God.

542
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,300
 Oh, only if this took place would I know the spirit's power in my life.

543
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,100
 No, right here and now, no matter what is happening, his spirit is available to you.

544
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,740
 His power is fully moved towards you.

545
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,180
 And I want to encourage you to shake off that mindset that would hold us back and instead

546
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:30,180
 to dream new dreams for your workplace, for your family, for your relationships, your

547
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,260
 sphere of influence.

548
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:36,580
 And yes, for us at The Vine, as we do church and life together.

549
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:42,220
 God has broken in and our relationship with Jesus connects us to him.

550
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,660
 He's not inviting us up on some stairway so we can have some mountaintop experience and

551
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,420
 feel better about ourselves.

552
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:54,260
 He's come down the stairway to meet us in our brokenness so that we could be transformed

553
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:00,940
 at the level of our soul, even when things are still crumbling around us.

554
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,500
 At the end of this week, with all the things that are going to be happening in the couple

555
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,740
 of weeks ahead, do we move in fear?

556
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
 No.

557
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,740
 Do we move in caution?

558
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,740
 Absolutely.

559
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,700
 Do we do what we can to make sure this virus is contained?

560
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,900
 Of course we will.

561
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,580
 But here's what we do move forward in.

562
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:22,140
 We move forward in knowing that this luz right now does not define the supernatural realities

563
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,140
 of God.

564
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:28,780
 That this luz right now can be turned upside down because God has come.

565
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,940
 I want to pray that over us.

566
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,260
 I want to pray that over you and wherever you're watching this right now, that this

567
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:39,280
 year would be a year of supernatural encounter for you, that you would come to know the Lord

568
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,700
 in a deeper way and that he would draw to you.

569
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,260
 And perhaps that's just your simple prayer this morning.

570
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:53,340
 It's just to say, God, I'm in luz and I want this luz to be renamed Bethel.

571
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,480
 Would you come?

572
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,280
 Would you peel back the curtain?

573
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,900
 Would you help me to dream again, to see again, to hope again, that even in this place that

574
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:07,300
 I'm in right now, it could be transformed by your glory and for your glory.

575
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,300
 I want to pray for us.

576
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,500
 If that's speaking to you, I want to encourage you, wherever you're watching this right now,

577
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,380
 just open up your hands and I want to come and let's pray.

578
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:21,660
 Father, for each person right now whose hands are open before you.

579
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,020
 Father, we ask Lord for Bethel.

580
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,420
 We ask for the house of God.

581
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,460
 Lord, I thank you that today on this message, people are watching this in their homes.

582
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,340
 Lord, I thank you for that because their homes is your house.

583
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,020
 The house of God is not 29 Burroughs Street in Wanchai.

584
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,700
 The house of God is wherever you're present.

585
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,180
 And you are present Jesus right now in every person who's watching this.

586
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,700
 And so Lord, I want to pray for that Bethel experience.

587
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,180
 I want to ask for the supernatural to be relative to us.

588
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,940
 Lord, in the same way that you helped Jacob and you were like, hey, look at this.

589
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,020
 This is what it really looks like.

590
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,500
 How those architects in Petra made that thing on top of the of the of the pillars to say,

591
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
 this is what it looks like.

592
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:18,500
 Lord, I pray that right now we would hear you say, hey, Andrew, this is what it really looks like.

593
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,340
 Hey, Andrew, this is what I'm doing right now.

594
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,780
 And I pray that that would be your story.

595
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,540
 And Father, I want to ask for that supernatural in breaking.

596
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,820
 Lord, it's a work of your grace.

597
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,940
 You've decided to come down.

598
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,780
 Your angels at work amongst us.

599
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,940
 And Father, you know the needs of the people that are watching this way better than I do.

600
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,220
 So I pray now, Lord, that you would come and this would be their reality.

601
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:55,780
 That they would be able to testify that even in Luz, they experienced Bethel.

602
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:00,740
 And Father, I pray that this would be for your glory, Lord.

603
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:05,060
 Lord, we pray for anybody that's particularly stressed because of these two weeks.

604
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:13,220
 We pray for those that own businesses or run restaurants or bars or clubs or massages or wherever it is, Lord.

605
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,500
 Those that are working in gyms.

606
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,460
 Father, we pray for those in our family that have been really impacted.

607
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,260
 Lord, they're in a place of isolation.

608
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,260
 They feel like they're in a place of kind of nothingness, the in-between.

609
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,180
 Lord, would you meet them right now in their Luz, Lord.

610
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,700
 And Lord, we recognize that all of us struggle with Luz.

611
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,300
 We have character issues.

612
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,940
 We have unforgiveness.

613
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,380
 We have bitterness.

614
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,420
 We have things that, Lord, are in our lives that we're not proud of, Lord.

615
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,460
 We ask that you would come and meet us in those places.

616
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,380
 That you would come and give us your supernatural strength and your supernatural vision

617
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,980
 for us to be able to have the ability to say sorry.

618
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,420
 The strength to repair broken walls.

619
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:08,780
 The strength to step away from a relationship if that's needed or step towards a relationship if that's needed.

620
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:15,900
 Lord, the strength to see what you're doing in a situation and be able to join you in it.

621
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,060
 Father, this is our desire, Lord.

622
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,260
 Would you move by your Spirit over your church, Lord.

623
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,060
 And we pray here at the Vine in 2022, whether we're online with church everywhere

624
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,500
 or gathered in a room in person together,

625
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,860
 that this would be a year of the power of the Spirit amongst us.

626
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,140
 Lord, we hunger not for worldly wisdom.

627
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,540
 We hunger for the wisdom that only comes from you.

628
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,740
 We hunger, Lord, for your insight, your power to be our everyday reality.

629
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,060
 And Lord, as we enter into the fast tomorrow,

630
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:53,980
 we ask that you would make that your space, Lord, that you would come and meet us.

631
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,060
 You would enable us to dream again.

632
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,740
 We pray this in Jesus name.

633
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,740
 Everyone says, Amen.
