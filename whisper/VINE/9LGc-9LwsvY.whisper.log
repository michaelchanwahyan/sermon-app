[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   I know there's people standing around as well.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.240]   It's kind of standing room only today.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.840]   So if you are standing around, please come on in,
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.680]   grab a seat.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.500]   There's a couple at the front here,
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.880]   there's a couple around the place.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.640]   We're so glad you're here at the Vine.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.520]   If you're new, my name is Andrew.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.340]   I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.620]   If you're watching us online, joining us online, welcome.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.420]   We're so glad that you're with us as well.
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.420]   And we are excited because I honestly believe this.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.440]   I said this in the 915.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.560]   It's not in my script at all,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.000]   but I honestly believe that this week ahead
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.960]   is gonna be the best week of your life.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.960]   The way you're sitting there looking at me right now
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.040]   is like I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.320]   You're lying to me.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.940]   That might sound like a bit of pop psychology.
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.700]   Hands up if you just had the best week of your life.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.540]   Hands up.
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.200]   Anyone get married or something this week?
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.520]   Jenny, come on.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.280]   I know you guys got married this past week.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.640]   There you go, there you go.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520]   It's funny, isn't it?
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.560]   So often we base the reality of having like the best day
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.840]   or the best week of our life
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.760]   by our circumstances and situations.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.180]   You know, like if I have a great week
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.320]   because I've done something amazing or new
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.600]   or my circumstances are great,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240]   we're like, we respond with the idea
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.640]   of I just had the best week of my life.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.520]   But it's really interesting
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.120]   that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120]   that our relationship with Jesus is new every morning,
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.520]   that it's almost like the next seven days
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.200]   can be the greatest that you've ever had in your life
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.720]   because you have a shepherd.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.800]   You have Jesus in your life
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.640]   who's longing to shape and mold and transform you
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.960]   and renew you and come to know you more.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.400]   And I think so often we think that our best weeks
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.080]   are because of circumstances, situations.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.720]   Maybe our best week is simply knowing
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.800]   that Jesus is with us again.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.360]   So when I come back here next week and I say,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.020]   did you just have the best week of your life?
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.600]   You're all gonna go, yes.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.320]   Okay, maybe not.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.140]   All right, whatever.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.880]   Here's why I just had the best week of my life.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.680]   Because I can honestly stand before you and say this.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.680]   The Lord is my shepherd, so I shall not be in want.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.560]   The Lord is my shepherd,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.220]   so there has never been a better week of my life.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.280]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.580]   I have never felt more alive than I do right now.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.740]   The Lord is my shepherd, so I shall not be in want.
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.240]   Perhaps one of the most famous verses
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.960]   in the whole of the Bible.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.200]   Certainly the most famous verse,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.260]   perhaps in the Old Testament.
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.300]   It's a verse, it's a Psalm that's read in funerals.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.280]   It's read in a variety of different places.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.040]   Perhaps you've come to hear it
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.940]   in a lot of different TV shows
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.920]   and things that happen around the world.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.200]   This is what Psalm 23 is for us.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.640]   It's a famous Psalm.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.720]   But it's a famous Psalm
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.120]   'cause it sits with an incredibly important metaphor.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.460]   In fact, it's a metaphor that's found
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.800]   throughout the whole of Scripture.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.240]   It's not just a metaphor that's mentioned once or twice.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.200]   It's a metaphor that starts at the beginning in Genesis.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.560]   And it's a metaphor that's also repeated at the end,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.120]   towards the end of Revelation.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.600]   And it's the idea that God is our shepherd.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.480]   Now, if you're anything like me,
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.600]   that is a metaphor that is about as far removed
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.280]   from the context of Hong Kong
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.920]   that you could ever possibly imagine.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.760]   I mean, follow this.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.960]   If this was the last time you were at a cocktail party
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.120]   and you said those words
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.520]   that we always say at a cocktail party,
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.360]   what do you do?
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.940]   And someone responded, "I'm a lawyer."
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.640]   And you're like, "Yes, of course."
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.840]   And you say to the next person, "What do you do?"
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.920]   They said, "I'm a doctor."
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.200]   You're like, "Of course you're a doctor.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.160]   Do we have any bankers in here?"
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.320]   Then you ask the person next, "What do you do?"
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.240]   And they say, "I'm a shepherd."
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.280]   And you're like, "Oh, okay."
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.440]   Doesn't happen, does it?
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.580]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.840]   We don't know what shepherds are
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.100]   'cause there's really not any shepherds in Hong Kong.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.720]   But here's the powerful thing.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.760]   I think actually this metaphor of being a shepherd
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.000]   is actually the primary metaphor that God wants to speak
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.680]   over the Church of Hong Kong right here and now
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   in this incredibly critical time in Hong Kong's history.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.760]   In fact, Psalm 23 is a Psalm that's not just designed
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.920]   so that you personally would know
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.800]   that you have a God who loves you,
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.080]   that you're secure in,
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.900]   that has filled your life with great things
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.640]   so that you know that He provides for you and protects you.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.080]   Psalm 23 is not just so that you would feel good
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.080]   about yourself and feel good about God
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.440]   and know that you've got a great life.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.440]   Psalm 23 is actually designed to cause you
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.680]   to purposefully live out the reality of that security
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.960]   right in the midst of the craziness of the world around you.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.760]   So often we read Psalm 23 and we think,
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.920]   "Oh, green pastures, quiet waters."
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.480]   In other words, I need to get out of Hong Kong.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.720]   I need to get away from the crazy mess that I'm in.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.560]   I need to get away from the stress and the anxiety.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.000]   I need to get away from the rat race.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.520]   I need to get away from all the stuff
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.480]   that seems to fill my mind with anxiety.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.760]   I need to just get away from life
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.360]   and then I can know a God who secures me.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.160]   Psalm 23 is actually designed to say this,
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.920]   you can know the rest and the beauty and the security of God
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.200]   even in the craziest moments of your life.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.560]   And because of that, every week can be your best week.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.840]   That is not dependent on circumstance or situation
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.280]   but you know you've got a great God.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.440]   God is right here with you right now.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   Do you know when David wrote this Psalm?
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.200]   We know actually, scholars know exactly
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.040]   when he wrote this Psalm.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.840]   He wrote this Psalm when Absalom was hunting him down
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.800]   in order to kill him.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.960]   He was living at the time in the wilderness,
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.900]   the Judean wilderness in Israel.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.480]   It was in the middle of nowhere, a barren place.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.160]   He was on his own and somebody was seeking him
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160]   with armies to kill him.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.000]   And he sits down to write a poem.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.760]   If I was in that situation and I wrote a poem,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.720]   I would not start with, "The Lord is my shepherd,
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.160]   "I shall not be in want."
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.440]   I would start with something like this,
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.480]   "I am completely alone, God,
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.040]   "and somebody is trying to kill me, where are you?"
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.680]   Anyone else vibe with that?
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.320]   David, in the middle of perhaps the worst moment of his life
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.120]   writes one of the most beautiful Psalms
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.200]   about the security that's found in God's presence.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.040]   Why?
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.040]   Because David is demonstrating something.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.480]   He's not just writing a nice fluffy poem for you.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.840]   He's saying, "This is what it looks like
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.200]   "when God actually is your shepherd.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.040]   "You can be rooted in the place of peace,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   "no matter what's happening around you."
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.260]   Jesus, many years later from David's writings,
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260]   picks up on this idea and he says,
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.740]   "You wanna know what the kingdom of God is like?
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.600]   "The kingdom of God is like a little piece of yeast
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.160]   "that you place in a massive bit of dough.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.920]   "And when it gets kneaded through the whole dough,
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.380]   "it influences that whole dough.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.920]   "That little piece of yeast,
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.360]   I think Jesus was talking about this idea
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.080]   of living out the gospel in the world,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.400]   not becoming Christians so that we can escape the world,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.880]   bungee jump up into heaven and la la on the clouds,
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.400]   but so that we can be deeply rooted
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   in the crises of our society.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.240]   So that as Christians,
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.280]   we could find a home in the midst of the turmoil.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.120]   So that when a city has protests
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.140]   and there's tear gas and Molotov cocktails flying,
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.560]   when there's a pandemic that enrages us all
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.480]   and shuts us behind closed doors,
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.520]   as Christians, we go, "Woo!"
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.640]   It's my time to lean into the chaos around me
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.060]   with the hope of the gospel.
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.320]   'Cause the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.520]   And even in this moment, I shall not be in one.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.080]   Which means that you don't need to be in one either.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.280]   Are you with me, church?
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.840]   The whole point of Psalm 23 is this,
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.800]   that you would be a non-anxious presence
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.400]   amid a chaotic world.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.680]   Think about that for a second.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.160]   Hands up if you would like to be a non-anxious presence.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.640]   Okay, those that didn't raise your hands,
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.120]   we're gonna talk later, okay?
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.920]   We wanna be a non-anxious presence.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.080]   I wanna be a non-anxious presence.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.640]   Could you imagine how beautiful it'd be
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.200]   to live in Hong Kong as a non-anxious presence?
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.680]   To be rooted so deeply in the security of Christ
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.320]   that people are attracted to us,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.200]   and we can say, "Well, the reason I'm this
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.280]   is because of Jesus."
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.080]   If you're anything like me, you're starting this series,
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.720]   and we're gonna take five weeks to unpack,
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.800]   and I'm gonna teach you as much as I can
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.840]   about this Psalm over the next five weeks.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.100]   But if you're anything like me, this is where we start.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.440]   We start in the reality of our anxiety.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.400]   Amen?
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.880]   We start in the reality that we're not
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.240]   a non-anxious presence.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.760]   We start in the reality that we are stressed at times,
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.400]   that we are overwhelmed, that despite our Christian faith,
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.760]   we are still overwhelmed.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:52.200]   And I think that's exactly where God wants us to start.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.440]   And so I actually wanna lead you
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.800]   in a meditation right now.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.760]   Now, don't freak out.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.160]   It's not a new age thing, meditation, okay?
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.760]   It's actually biblical, it's in scripture.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.200]   I wanna lead you in a starting point
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.800]   of just reflecting where we are in the reality
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.120]   to the chaos that's around us.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.840]   So I wonder whether you'd just close your eyes,
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.400]   and if you're comfortable, you could just open your hands.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.760]   You don't need to, but if you're comfortable.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.800]   If you're online right now,
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.120]   I wanna encourage you to do this as well.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.160]   Just close your eyes where you are, open your hands.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.960]   I wanna encourage you just to take a moment
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.380]   to start this series before God with an open heart.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.800]   I want you to take a moment to think honestly
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.360]   about the places of anxiety in your life right now.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.780]   We all have them.
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:46.880]   None of us are immune to worry, to concern,
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.760]   frustration, hurt, being overwhelmed.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:58.040]   Wherever it might be in your life right now
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.680]   where you sense some anxiety, maybe a sense of fear,
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.900]   maybe a sense where you're not satisfied,
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.240]   where there's need in you.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.660]   I wonder whether you just take a moment
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.600]   to think about those places for you.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.400]   Some of you might wanna invite the Holy Spirit
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.200]   just to reveal to you those places.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.120]   (congregation member coughing)
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.760]   Father, we thank you that although it's not always
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.000]   comfortable, sometimes it's important
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.160]   to recognize our anxiety.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:43.480]   It's important for us to understand
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.480]   that there are things in life that do overwhelm us.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.920]   Father, I just wanna pray that you would come
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   and meet each person here with their hands open
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.620]   and eyes closed before you.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:02.280]   Wherever it is that they're feeling overwhelmed today,
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.680]   you would come.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.160]   Watch your eyes are closed and your hands are open,
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.400]   your heart is bowed.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.240]   Listen to this.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.800]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.520]   I shall not be in want.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.320]   For he makes me lie down in green passages.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.200]   He leads me beside quiet waters.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.240]   He actually restores my soul.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:35.600]   He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.280]   Even though I may walk through the valley
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.280]   of the shadow of death at times, I will fear no evil
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.560]   for you are with me.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.360]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.680]   I mean, you prepare a table before me
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.960]   in the presence of my enemies.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.440]   My head is anointed with oil.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.920]   My cup, it overflows.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.920]   I mean, surely goodness and love will follow me
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.560]   all the days of my life.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.560]   And I will dwell, live, abide, have my roots,
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.560]   find my life in the house of the Lord.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.280]   Forever.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.520]   Okay, you can open your eyes.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.640]   Isn't that a beautiful Psalm?
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.760]   Isn't that wonderful?
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.720]   Verse one is a summary of the whole thing.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.600]   It says this, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.520]   I shall not be in want."
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.320]   And Dave starts with that crazy statement.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.560]   And the rest of the Psalm unpacks the power
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.400]   of what that means.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.240]   And over the next five weeks,
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   we're gonna unpack exactly what David means.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.360]   I wanna provide just a summary of that
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.200]   in our time together today.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.560]   I wanna tell you a little bit about
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.680]   what being a shepherd is.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.000]   But because you've never been to a cocktail party
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.800]   in Hong Kong and met a shepherd,
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.320]   I wanna take you now to the very place
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.800]   that David was writing about.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.480]   David was writing about the Judean wilderness.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.880]   He was in the Judean wilderness at the time
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.160]   and he was writing the Psalm there.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   And I wanna take you there to help you to see
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.440]   and get a feel of exactly what a shepherd was like.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.720]   Back in 2016, I had the opportunity
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.680]   of traveling to Israel.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.160]   And I had the opportunity of actually filming
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.560]   a documentary sermon series called "The Story of Jesus,"
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.480]   where we went through the Gospel of Luke together.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.080]   If you were a part of the Vine back then,
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.880]   we did that series here together as a church.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.840]   But during that time, me and the film crew,
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.800]   we got to spend a day with an actual shepherd,
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.680]   like a real life breathing modern day shepherd
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.800]   in the Judean wilderness, right?
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.880]   Where David wrote this Psalm.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.360]   And during that day, we filmed him, filmed his life,
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.040]   and we interviewed him.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.080]   And he told us what it was
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.040]   and what it meant to be a shepherd.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.240]   And so I'd love to take you right now
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.520]   to the Judean wilderness and introduce you
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.800]   to a friend of mine called Abdallah.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.560]   Screen's here or up here.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:03.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:10.360]   (gentle music)
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:37.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:58.840]   (gentle music)
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.200]   (gentle music)
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:24.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.600]   (gentle music)
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:52.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.240]   (gentle music)
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:15.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.240]   (gentle music)
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:42.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.560]   (gentle music)
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.000]   (gentle music)
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:22.520]   (gentle music)
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.040]   (gentle music)
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:56.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.840]   (gentle music)
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:26.840]   (gentle music)
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   - All right, there you go.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.920]   If anybody asks you, you've now finally met a shepherd.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.280]   Now there's a couple of things that Abdallah mentions here
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.720]   that I think helps us understand where David's coming from.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.080]   Let me read you a few of these.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.480]   "The day of a shepherd doesn't finish," Abdallah says,
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.240]   "ever, you are always in the field with them."
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.120]   There is no such thing as a part-time shepherd.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.600]   There's no such thing as a shepherd one day
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.920]   and then kind of goes off shopping
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.000]   in Koso Bay the next day, right?
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.840]   He said that himself.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.680]   "I can't go shopping in Haifa or Jerusalem.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.120]   "I have to be here all the time.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.400]   "Even when I'm resting," he says,
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.320]   "I'm on the lookout to see if anything needs my help."
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.400]   There's this consistency, a sacrifice of 24/7.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.920]   He said he's been being a shepherd for 15 years.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.960]   So for 15 years, he's been with his sheep day in, day out,
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.240]   nonstop, that's the life of a shepherd.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.040]   And when David says, "The Lord is my shepherd,"
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.600]   what he's trying to communicate to himself and to us
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.360]   is that we do not have a part-time God.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.480]   You do not have a God who's a God for you sometimes
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.960]   and a God for you another time,
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.120]   and other times he's just distant from you.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.400]   I think so often as Christians,
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.280]   we actually think that God is sometimes distant from us.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.560]   We think in the good moments of life, we have God's presence
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.400]   but in the bad moments, in the times
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.600]   where maybe we've done some things we're not proud of
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.160]   or we've gotten involved in some things
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.520]   that we knew we shouldn't have gotten involved in,
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.360]   we think God distanced himself from us.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.560]   That's completely not what scripture teaches us.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.680]   If scripture says that God is a shepherd
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.640]   and Jesus himself uses the word,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.720]   he says, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.080]   So if Jesus is saying that,
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.920]   what he's saying is, "I've never given up on you.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.080]   "I've never failed you.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.560]   "I've never walked away from you.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.760]   "I'm always here for you.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.420]   "Even when you think I'm distant,
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.800]   "I'm actually closer than you realize."
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.760]   Even in the things that you've done that I'm not proud of,
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.120]   that I don't want for you,
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.960]   that kind of breaks my heart for you,
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.900]   my grace is always stronger than my wrath.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.440]   I'm here with you.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.560]   And for some of you in this room,
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.440]   that's an incredibly important thing to grapple with.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.540]   It's an important thing for you to know.
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.160]   You do not have a part-time God.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.520]   He is always with you.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.140]   Some of you in this room feel like he's a long way away
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.440]   because of simply how you're living your life.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.600]   And I wanna encourage you.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.720]   He has never been closer to you
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.420]   than right here in this moment.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.400]   You okay?
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.400]   I need a little bit more church.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.360]   You there?
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.100]   He's never been closer to you than right in this moment.
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.100]   'Cause in his eyes, today is the greatest day of your life.
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.880]   Here's the second thing he says.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.400]   He says this, "When the sun is strong,
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.980]   "I need to provide the sheep
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.480]   "with a place for the shade or trees.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.100]   "A shepherd is a provider."
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.640]   When David says, "The Lord is my shepherd,"
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.760]   he's thinking about the idea
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.480]   of a shepherd providing for his flock.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.240]   A shepherd's sole job, notice this,
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.320]   his sole job was to keep the sheep alive.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.640]   And the way that he did that was by food and water.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.560]   And here's the thing.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   The food and the water were never often in the same place.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.040]   So a shepherd had to plan his day.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.800]   He had to decide, okay, at the start of the day,
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.000]   we're gonna go to this field
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.620]   and I'm gonna get the food for the sheep.
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.720]   And then in the second part of the day,
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.800]   we're gonna go down the valley here to this river
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   and they're gonna have a drink.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.920]   And then in the third part of the day,
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.160]   I'm gonna bring them back up.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.840]   The shepherd had to plan all that out.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.040]   He had to think, how do I best provide for my sheep
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.240]   to grow and to flourish, to be the best that they can be?
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.560]   Well, I've gotta plan that out, map that out.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.440]   And here's the thing.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.360]   A shepherd doesn't just plan it out on a daily basis.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.280]   A shepherd had to plan it out on an annual basis
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.920]   because there are seasons.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.320]   And in the summer season, the shepherd knows
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.760]   that food is in abundance
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.840]   because of the spring and the summer harvests.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.120]   But water is at a premium.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.840]   He also knows in the winter, food is not in abundance.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.640]   And so here's what a shepherd had to do.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.320]   A shepherd had to plan to provide for his sheep
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.040]   in the season of winter,
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.280]   by in the season of spring and summer,
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.800]   actually harvesting more, storing it.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.080]   So in the leaner months during winter,
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.840]   it had food to provide and give to its sheep.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.240]   That's how much a shepherd has to think.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.260]   They're a strategic planner over the life of their sheep.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.940]   You need to know that your God is exactly the same.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.280]   And this is a revelation for some of you here.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.000]   God is a strategic planner over your life.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.560]   He knows who you are.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.200]   He knows where you're going.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.720]   And like the seasons that the sheep go through,
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.220]   so we go through seasons, don't we?
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.640]   Some of you right now are in a season of winter,
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.120]   perhaps in your life.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.360]   You would be honest and say,
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.440]   "I'm in a bit of a dark season.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.880]   "I'm in a difficult season."
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.060]   You need to know that that doesn't surprise God.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.280]   You need to know that He knew
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.040]   that you were heading into that season.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.960]   And because He knew you were heading into that season,
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.780]   He thought to Himself,
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.920]   "I better store up some stuff over here
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.700]   "so that when they get into that season,
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.760]   "I can provide out of the abundance
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.640]   "of what they think they lack in that moment."
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.480]   You have a God who has planned every step of your life.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.680]   Jesus Himself would describe Himself this way.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.220]   He says, "I am the Alpha and the Omega,
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.040]   "the beginning and the end.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.360]   "And if I'm in the beginning and I'm at the end,
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.920]   "well, then everything in the middle is taken care of."
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.200]   And some of you just need to grasp a hold of this.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.240]   If you're gonna become a non-anxious presence in Hong Kong,
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.860]   God's got you covered.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:01.120]   God has everything in your life covered,
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.760]   the beginning and the end.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.240]   That's what it is to provide as a shepherd.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.520]   That's His life over you.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.960]   That's His passion for you.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.120]   And even in the winter months that you're in,
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.760]   you think that God has left you,
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.280]   you think He's surprised by it.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.880]   No, no, no, He's already stored up the abundance
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.920]   of what He wants to give you in that time.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.020]   Here's the third thing Abel says.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.280]   "Sometimes there is a wolf in the middle of the desert,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.920]   "and he doesn't just take one sheep for his food, but many.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.320]   "If there is a virus or a sickness,
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.240]   "the shepherd will be concerned for his herd.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.660]   "Not only is a shepherd 100% committed, 100% provides,
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.620]   "but he also protects.
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.660]   "He also protects from the wolves and the viruses
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.660]   "and the things that could disrupt the life of the sheep.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.200]   "He's trying to keep the sheep alive,
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.960]   "so he's gonna do his utmost to protect the sheep."
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.960]   We saw actually in the film how Abdallah does this.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.320]   He has a sheepfold.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.840]   It's a modern one with fences around it.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.600]   And it had that sort of cast iron gate
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.800]   that he moves in front of it at one point.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.360]   Well, back in David's day, when he's writing the Psalm,
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.800]   there weren't modern day sheepfolds.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.760]   What a shepherd did in those days to protect the sheep
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.220]   is he built a little kind of round container of stones.
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.620]   And the stones would be built up
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.740]   to about four to six feet high.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.580]   And it would be about just the size
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.300]   of coming around this area here.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.820]   And he would put the sheep in there at nighttime.
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.660]   And guess what?
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.540]   There was only one entrance in and one entrance out.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.660]   So to protect the sheep from wolves or from robbers
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.500]   that might come in and try to steal the sheep,
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.980]   the shepherd would lie down at the front of the gate
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.540]   to the sheepfold that he had created.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.120]   It was the shepherd's way of saying,
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.360]   "Nothing is gonna get past me."
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.720]   Have you seen the Lord of the Rings
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.440]   where Gandalf gets the staff?
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.600]   He goes, "You shall not pass."
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.120]   Remember that moment?
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.240]   You need to watch Lord of the Rings again
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.320]   if you don't remember.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.960]   It's a great moment.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   This is the idea of Jesus as our shepherd.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.200]   He stands before the gateways of our lives.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.320]   And he says to the enemy, "You shall not pass.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.600]   "You're not getting in here.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.480]   "This one's mine."
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.000]   God does this in the sheepfold
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.880]   of the modern day context, the church.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.760]   We are Jesus's sheepfold.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.840]   He has constructed a church, not a building, but people.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.340]   The people around you right now are your place
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.480]   of courage and strength and encouragement and life.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   This is who you're sitting around right now.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.280]   The church itself is the sheepfold of God.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.240]   And here's the thing, as a shepherd,
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.520]   Jesus is at the front door of the church in Hong Kong.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.960]   He is the gatekeeper.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.960]   He is the watchman over us, his people.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.780]   And I don't know about you,
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.480]   but that's really encouraging news for me
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.440]   as we think about what the church might be going through
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.720]   in the years ahead here in our city.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.360]   I mean, we don't know what's ahead for us.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.640]   And I'm not trying to suggest
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.880]   that there's gonna be anything crazy,
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.880]   but the reality is we don't know right now.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.920]   But what I do know is that we have a God
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.360]   who will protect the church,
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.320]   a God who will fight on our behalf,
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.800]   a God who fights battles for his sheep.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.960]   That's good news for all of us.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.200]   Here's the final thing Abdallah says.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.960]   He says, "The heart is where you learn to lead your sheep,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.820]   to guide them to the right place.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.580]   It is where you learn to help and guide other people."
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.880]   So the shepherd is not just constantly there for us.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.380]   He's not just a provider or a protector,
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.500]   but in order to provide and protect,
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.780]   the shepherd also has to do the final thing,
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.980]   and that is to lead, to guide the sheep.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.660]   I mean, this is constantly what a shepherd needs to do,
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.260]   whether it's into that field or that field,
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.520]   down the valley over here,
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.020]   back into the sheepfold at night.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.820]   Constantly the shepherd is thinking about,
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.420]   "How do I guide? How do I lead the sheep?"
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.180]   Now, here's what happened in David's time,
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.500]   as David's writing this psalm.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.100]   Normally a shepherd would bring sheep into, say,
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.660]   a big open field, like you saw in the film,
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.620]   just like that, Judean wilderness, massive open fields.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.020]   And the sheep would scatter all over the place
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.140]   to graze and get their food.
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.500]   But every once in a while,
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:57.220]   the shepherd would need to gather the sheep back to himself.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.500]   Maybe there's a danger,
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.140]   maybe he sees a wolf in the distance,
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.140]   or something's happening,
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.780]   or maybe they need shade in that moment, whatever it is,
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.020]   but the shepherd has to call the sheep in.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.180]   So here's how the shepherd would do that.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.980]   The shepherd would come and stand
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.780]   in the middle of all the sheep.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.620]   This is the reason why we set up the church this way today.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.460]   All right?
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.340]   It's not just to be funky and fancy.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.060]   It's actually to teach you something.
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.140]   You are my sheep.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.940]   I'm the shepherd, okay?
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.180]   I'm in the middle.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.100]   So the shepherd would come right here
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.540]   in the middle of all the sheep,
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.540]   and the shepherd would kind of look out,
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.700]   and he would make a distinctive call to the sheep.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.420]   In the film, I don't know if you noticed it,
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.180]   but Abdallah, he put his hand together,
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.180]   and I can't make the noise,
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.380]   so he went, "Wee, wee, wee," something like that.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.260]   Sounds like a duck.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.780]   Okay, I'm sure it wasn't a duck.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.820]   But he made a noise into his hand.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.460]   That was his distinctive call.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.980]   Now, a shepherd would come into the center of things,
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.580]   make that call, and the sheep,
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.260]   no matter how scattered they were,
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.820]   would gather around the shepherd.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.700]   They knew the voice.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.900]   This is why Jesus says,
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.060]   later on, some 1,500 years later,
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.220]   he says, "I'm the good shepherd,
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.820]   "and the sheep know my voice."
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.500]   Here's the thing.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.740]   You have a God just like that.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.020]   You wanna know why you can be a non-anxious presence
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.860]   in the chaos of your life right now?
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.220]   Because you have a shepherd who stands
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.900]   right in the middle of the scatteredness of your life
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.940]   and calls out to you
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.400]   with the distinctive call of the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.260]   That's Jesus in your life,
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.940]   that he will come into the darkest places,
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.180]   the hardest places, the most scattered places.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.700]   No matter how crazy your emotions might be,
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.580]   you have a God who's able to walk
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.900]   into the middle of that for you
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.940]   and call you back into peace with him.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.260]   Jesus says, "All who are wearied and burdened,
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:47.340]   "if they would just come to me, you would find rest."
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:52.020]   So these ideas of security, of provision,
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.460]   of protection, and of guidance are the four things
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.060]   that David's trying to communicate
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.620]   about the idea of God being a shepherd.
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.020]   And in David's eyes, if you can get your head around that,
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.660]   that you always have someone with you,
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.540]   always have someone who's gonna provide for you,
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.060]   always protect you, always lead and guide you,
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.500]   he can make the crazy statement at the end of verse one.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.540]   "I am not in want."
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:19.260]   That's a crazy statement.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.100]   It's a statement I don't think I have ever made fully.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.980]   I mean, imagine if we could say that like David did,
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.220]   because of all these things,
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.740]   'cause I have a God who's my shepherd.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.940]   I know I am not in want, but we all have wants.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:36.780]   We all have needs.
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.100]   What is David actually talking about here?
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.060]   Well, he's not talking about the fact that in Christ Jesus,
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.140]   all of your needs and wants will just magically disappear.
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.700]   He's not saying he's a genie in a bottle
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.940]   who's just gonna wave his little magic wand
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.260]   and make everything perfect for you.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.860]   What he's talking about is that we have a God
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:59.180]   who is able to provide every good thing
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.100]   that we need in life.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.700]   Every good thing, not everything we may want,
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.200]   maybe not that Ferrari or the perfect body,
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.940]   but every good thing that we need for life
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.300]   and character and sustenance
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.980]   and to get through the things that we face in life,
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.840]   every good thing to help you in whatever it is
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.700]   that God has put in your hands to do,
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.780]   he has provided for that thing.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.100]   He is my shepherd, I shall not be in want,
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.600]   literally means I shall never lack any good thing.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.900]   And because of that, we're able to then say this to God,
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.360]   I am at rest.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.260]   Think about this for a sec.
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:43.400]   If you could honestly say that I lack no good thing,
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.880]   then really what you're saying is I'm at rest.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.400]   I'm a restful presence.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.360]   I'm not trying to grasp a hold of things
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.280]   that are not for me to grasp.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.800]   I'm not freaking out about stuff
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.960]   that's not for me to freak out about.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.440]   I'm not trying to find things in my life
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.280]   to satisfy my needs, I'm finding that satisfaction
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.840]   solely in Christ Jesus.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.280]   I'm alive like I've never been alive before, I'm at peace
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.800]   like I've never been at peace before.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.760]   This is biblical shalom.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.700]   Rest in the Bible is not a beach holiday in Bali
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.840]   with a pina colada.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.420]   Rest in the Bible is this idea of an eternal peace
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:26.420]   inside of us, this deep, eternal peace that strengthens us,
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.820]   that we know comes from a God that we absolutely trust,
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.260]   that we're absolutely secure in,
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.220]   one who protects, provides, and guides in us.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:39.220]   To say I am not in want is ultimately to say I am at rest.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:45.700]   And here's the challenge, right as we start this series,
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.580]   can we honestly say that we're not at rest?
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:56.260]   Can we honestly say that we found a place of complete peace?
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:01.220]   Can we honestly say to ourselves that in every area
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.700]   of our lives, we have no wants, no anxiety,
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.900]   no sense of lack of satisfaction?
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.540]   'Cause I don't know about you, but I live in Hong Kong.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.100]   And if you live in Hong Kong, we live in a society,
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.060]   in a culture, in a place where it's constantly
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:21.660]   challenging us that we do not have enough.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.560]   It's constantly telling us that we need more,
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.580]   that we should get more.
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.520]   Look at your neighbor, they have more.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.020]   Hong Kong is a place where, although God might be saying
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.900]   to us, we need to be able to say, I shall not be in want,
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.260]   Hong Kong is saying to us, I completely lack.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.060]   Are you with me?
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.180]   That's where we live.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.820]   And so we have to do some wrestling with the reality
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:50.860]   that actually Hong Kong is shepherding us
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.660]   more than perhaps Jesus Christ is at times.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.740]   We have to wrestle as a church with the reality
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.300]   that if there are things in my life that are not at peace,
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.220]   if there is stuff in me, that is this anxiety
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.800]   wracked inside of me, if there's stuff going on,
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.700]   then there's probably a part of my life
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.220]   that has not yet been given over to the Lordship of Jesus.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:15.660]   Because if David's true, that God is our shepherd,
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:19.140]   and that therefore that means we should not be in want,
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.500]   then if I have any areas in my life where I'm in want,
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.420]   I have to ask myself, is God fully my shepherd?
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.300]   Are you following me?
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.780]   That's the challenge of this verse.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.060]   You could actually read Psalm 23, one in reverse.
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.960]   So the actual way of saying it is, God is my shepherd,
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.340]   I shall not be in want.
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.940]   The other way of saying it in reverse is, I am in want,
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.900]   therefore God is not fully my shepherd.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.900]   Do you follow that?
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.020]   That's how we start this series,
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:54.500]   by recognizing that there is still something inside of us.
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:59.020]   And my question to you right at the beginning is this,
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.240]   what is actually shepherding you?
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.940]   If you're honest with yourself,
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.620]   what is actually your shepherd?
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.820]   Is it culture?
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.460]   Is it a relationship you're in?
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.540]   Is it your finances?
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:20.780]   Is it some life decision you need to make?
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.340]   Is it the pressure of somebody's words
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.220]   that have been spoken over you?
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.500]   Is it the pressure you put on yourself
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.880]   to try to please somebody?
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.020]   What actually is it that's shepherding you
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.380]   as the person you are today?
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.100]   And if there's some things inside of you
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:39.260]   that are anxious and stressed and not fully satisfied,
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.900]   if there's stuff going on inside of you
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.100]   like there is in me, I have to do the work of saying,
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.780]   "What then is shepherding that bit of me?"
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.660]   Because if the Lord was my shepherd,
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.140]   I could honestly say I'm not in want.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.540]   I could honestly say,
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:00.100]   "This week is gonna be the best week of my life."
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.580]   As we start the series, I wanna encourage you
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.180]   to take the time in your own spiritual devotions this week
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.940]   to recognize the things that we started the service with,
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.140]   those anxious places that I had you bring to mind,
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.980]   and to bring those anxious places to God and say,
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.640]   "Lord, what is shepherding me in this area?
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.540]   What is guiding me in this place right here?"
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.180]   Because I wanna be able to bring that to you,
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.100]   and I need you to be with me, protecting, providing,
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.660]   and guiding me in that area.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.500]   Amen?
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.300]   Would you stand with me?
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.540]   I'd love to pray for you.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:44.500]   Maybe you'd, maybe we'd finish where we started,
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.620]   just opening our hands.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.140]   Would you just close your eyes and open your hands?
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:54.940]   Father, we say together in our hearts that this is us.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.340]   This is for us today.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:01.940]   We recognize the anxiety,
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.140]   the anxiety that's in us at times.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.500]   We recognize how we are absorbed
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.580]   by the Hong Kong culture and systems.
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.900]   We recognize that we find ourselves unsatisfied
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.540]   because of what culture tells us.
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:20.380]   We recognize that we have a inherent at times,
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.460]   desire for more and more and more.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.700]   And we recognize, Lord, that every time we do that,
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.020]   it's because something else is shepherding us,
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.020]   something that is not of you.
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.860]   (gentle music)
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.260]   Father, we recognize that the foundation
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.700]   of a lot of our anxiety
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:42.060]   is because something is shepherding us more than you.
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.020]   Father, we come to you today,
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.780]   not because you're angry at us,
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.980]   not because you're telling us off.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:56.540]   We come to you today because you are creating a space
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.700]   for that place of intimacy with you
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.340]   where rest is truly found.
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.820]   Lord, we wanna be like David who,
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.900]   in being hunted down to be killed,
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:13.340]   could still write and say that he has nothing to fear,
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.860]   nothing to want, no anxiety,
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.460]   that he could proclaim that you are his shepherd,
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:23.820]   his protector, provider, and guider in life.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.500]   Lord, I pray that that would become
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.660]   our declaration here at the Vine.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.980]   Lord, I pray for every person in this room and online
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.060]   who have their hands open right now.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:37.180]   Lord, I pray that they would also experience the beauty
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.900]   of a God who is with them right here and now,
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.260]   who has all their cares and concerns in his hands,
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.900]   who fights battles for them and loves them.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:54.500]   Father, I pray you would fill us with the courage
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.420]   to bring our anxieties to you,
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.620]   with the courage to confess the other shepherds
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.100]   in our lives, with the courage to be able to do that
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.300]   together in our community groups alongside of one another
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:11.700]   so that we could walk in more rest in you.
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.740]   Lord, we desire to be a non-anxious presence
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.500]   amid the chaos of this world.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.540]   Would that be the focus of the next five weeks
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.940]   for us as a church?
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.020]   We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.980]   Everyone says, amen.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:24.820]   Awesome.
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.180]   Let's respond in worship.
