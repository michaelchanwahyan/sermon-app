[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   as you would have him speak this morning.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   It's in your name we pray, amen.
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.760]   - Can we thank Promise as always?
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.740]   Promise, amazing.
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.200]   It's so good to be back.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.280]   Honestly, it's so great to be back.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.560]   I have been away for four months.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.920]   If you're new to the Vine, like Promise said,
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.660]   it's an honor to meet you today.
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.840]   I'm looking forward to getting to know you
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.360]   a little bit more over the next couple of months.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.320]   But it's a real privilege to kind of come back.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.720]   I came back last Sunday.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.440]   I was sitting here in the front last Sunday.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.320]   I didn't have anything to do, which was awesome.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.320]   So I was able just to connect with everybody.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.680]   A lot of you came and said hello
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.280]   and gave me hugs and stuff like that,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.360]   which was such a blessing.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.920]   I really did feel welcomed home,
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.080]   which was a wonderful thing.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.800]   But I think more important than that,
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.920]   as I sat there throughout the three services
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.360]   across last Sunday, as I listened to Ellison
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.920]   preach an incredible word,
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.840]   and as I sat under the ministry of our team and worship,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.480]   I realized just how much the church has grown,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.080]   how much the church has flourished
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.240]   in the four months that I've been away,
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.440]   how the spiritual health of the church
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.640]   is deeper and richer and more mature than it has been
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.720]   since I can honestly remember.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.000]   And it honestly is such a privilege as a senior leader
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.680]   to step out of your church context for four months,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.520]   come back, and the church is thriving and growing
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.760]   and deeper in its relationship with Jesus.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.400]   So I just wanna really honor all of our leaders here,
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.800]   the pastoral team, the eldership,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.160]   everybody who has been kind of taking charge
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.000]   and looking after everything
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.720]   whilst I've been gone.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.920]   It truly is an incredible thing to step back
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280]   and realize that I don't need to be here.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.640]   And it's so funny, like about two weeks before I came back,
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.920]   I'm walking in Spain.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.440]   I'll tell you a little bit more about that in a minute.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.280]   I'm walking in Spain,
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.240]   I get a phone call from a congregation member,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.960]   and they're like, "Andrew, things are going so well.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.880]   "You don't need to come back."
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.680]   (laughing)
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.560]   I was like, "Oh, that's nice."
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.320]   (laughing)
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.360]   No, no, it was awesome.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.400]   And it is honestly such a privilege
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.240]   to be able to actually say that I don't come back
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.840]   'cause you guys need me to come back.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.440]   I come back 'cause this is my home,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.000]   and I am so excited to be back with you,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.640]   and looking forward, as I've said,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.800]   to getting to know some of you that I don't know.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320]   My last message that I preached here
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.720]   was back on June 30th,
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.760]   just a day before I stepped on the sabbatical.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.840]   I stepped on the sabbatical the very next day,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.720]   and on that Sunday, I brought a message
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.320]   around the prayer of Jabez,
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.840]   and I said on that Sunday that actually,
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.440]   when we misinterpret or we misunderstand
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.360]   the prayer of Jabez, I think so much.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.200]   We often have thought that that's a prayer of prosperity,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.000]   a prayer of blessing, of God expanding us,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.560]   but actually, when you dig into the story,
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.600]   you realize that, I said on that Sunday,
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.400]   you realize that Jabez's name,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.200]   his mother calls him Jabez
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.720]   because that name literally sounds in the Hebrew
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.800]   like the word he who causes pain,
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.480]   and his mother had had this massive child pain
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480]   in giving birth to Jabez,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.640]   so she names him the one who caused me pain,
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.040]   and I said that Sunday that Jabez has grown up
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.600]   with this label placed upon him,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.800]   and this label has shifted him
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   and molded him as a man as he's grown up,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.360]   and he's constantly been under the pressure
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.120]   of this label that says I am one who causes pain,
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.680]   and in his prayer, as well as saying,
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.400]   God, would you come and do this for me,
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.200]   at the end of the prayer, he says this profound thing.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   He says, so that I will no longer be one who causes pain.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.920]   In other words, his prayer is a prayer for liberation
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.560]   from the labels that had hurt him and held him back.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.880]   It's a powerful prayer, and I said that Sunday
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.600]   that I resonate with that prayer
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.640]   because I'm stepping into my sabbatical,
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.480]   and I'm realizing that there are labels
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.640]   that I'm carrying with me.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.960]   I realize that there are some things
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.640]   that over the last number of years of ministry,
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.640]   whether meaning to do it or not,
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.000]   some people have said some things that have hurt me,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.920]   said some things that I've had to carry around with me,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.960]   and that maybe I've taken on board too much,
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.320]   and I've not been able to shake,
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.800]   and it's molded and shaped the way I think
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.240]   and the way I act, and I realize
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.560]   that I had still some deep insecurities inside of me.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.480]   There were labels I was carrying as a pastor
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.680]   that I needed to deal with,
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.760]   and I knew that sabbatical was my time
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.560]   to come before the Lord and try to shift
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.440]   some of those things.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.400]   Prayer of Jabez was my prayer
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.360]   that I may no longer still think this about me.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.960]   Alongside of that, the reality for me
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.280]   is that I'm turning 50 in February,
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.760]   just in a few months' time.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.320]   You clap.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.160]   You clap, but I realize that I am now
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.560]   officially very, very old.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.760]   And as I am thinking about turning 50 in February,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.800]   I have to say I'm having these thoughts
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.520]   of like, oh my gosh, the average age
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.400]   here at the Vine over our three services is 29.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.000]   I am no longer 29.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.600]   I'm a long way away from 29.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.520]   And so I've been wrestling as well
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.680]   with these sorts of, am I past my use by date?
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.440]   Am I no longer relevant for the young people?
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.680]   There's a lot of, I can see a lot of young people here.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.160]   Am I no longer relevant?
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.120]   There's some young people over here too, don't worry.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.840]   But am I no longer relevant
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.920]   to the young people in this church?
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.040]   I'm turning 50, I'm old, what am I gonna do?
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.160]   And that actually sparked me thinking like,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.320]   well, what am I gonna do for the rest of my life?
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.680]   You know, like my life is almost over.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.480]   Like what am I gonna do for the next 15, 20 years?
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.080]   How am I going to lead the Vine?
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.280]   What am I gonna do here?
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.560]   What's the next steps for me?
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.280]   And I have all of this stuff coming together.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.800]   So as I stepped on sabbatical on July 1,
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.040]   I took out my journal, which is my iPhone,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.920]   and I wrote in my iPhone some critical questions
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.120]   that I wanted God to answer during my sabbatical.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.920]   Let me read you the actual questions
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.920]   I wrote down in my journal.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.880]   How much longer do you want me to be a pastor?
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.880]   Because I realized that being a pastor
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.640]   is a calling from you, and I can't assume
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.080]   that that calling's always gonna be there.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.960]   So how much longer, Lord, do you want me to do this thing
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.760]   that you've called me to do?
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.120]   Connected to that, I was asking this,
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.800]   how much longer should I lead the Vine for?
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.040]   'Cause as you guys have experienced in the last four months,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.520]   we have an incredible team of people here.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.200]   We have this embarrassment of riches
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.400]   when it comes to talent and heart and calling
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.640]   and the work of the spirit amongst us by our pastoral team.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.040]   How much longer should I lead for?
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.680]   Maybe it's time for me to hand over,
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.120]   'cause I'm turning 50, right?
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.560]   You know, and this is all going in my head.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.560]   So I wrote this.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.440]   When and how should I hand over the church
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.120]   to the next generation?
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.760]   When should that be?
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.320]   When, God, are you going to ask me to do that?
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.440]   And that kind of created some thoughts in me
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.920]   that weren't necessarily healthy, so I also wrote this.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.040]   I said, what the heck will I do for my living
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.840]   if you take the church away from me?
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.240]   I'm just being honest.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   This is what I'm writing in my journal,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.240]   'cause if you call me away or if you raise somebody else up,
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.400]   what am I gonna do for my living?
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.760]   You've taken away my living from me.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.440]   This is my attitude, not very good, I realize,
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.160]   which led me to the next question,
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.360]   which is why am I still so filled
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.400]   with insecurity and self-doubts, right?
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.120]   And then out of that came perhaps
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.240]   the most important question of all that I wrote down.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.920]   I said this, I said, do aliens really exist?
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.440]   'Cause I really need to know, Lord.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.480]   No, okay, that wasn't in my journal.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.560]   Let's just rub that one out.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.400]   We're gonna rub that out.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.880]   Rub it out, yep, there you go.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.120]   So that wasn't in my journal, but the rest of them were.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.360]   So you get an idea of kind of the things
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.520]   that were on my heart as I was stepping into sabbatical,
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.200]   the things that I was seeking God's will for,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.400]   and what I was wanting is to get a revelation from Him
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.680]   in these areas of my life so that I could come back here
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.960]   and give you, kind of partake and put that revelation
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.560]   into us, and I'm super excited to announce here
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.680]   this afternoon, it's an important announcement.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.560]   I'm gonna announce to you that over my sabbatical,
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.040]   God did not talk to me about any of those things.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.600]   Not one thing at all.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.720]   None of those things were what God spoke to me about.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.240]   Have you ever had that with God?
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.360]   You know, like you show up with a laundry list of things,
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.480]   like here's all the things that you need
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.000]   to speak to me about, and God's like,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.920]   (laughing)
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.360]   as in like those are the important ones.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.840]   No, Andrew, actually, here are the things
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.120]   that I need to talk to you about.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.440]   So let's just wipe that away,
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.040]   'cause God just wiped that away.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.920]   And instead, about two weeks into my sabbatical,
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.320]   God comes to me and He says, Andrew,
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.440]   there are actually only three things
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.960]   I wanna talk to you about over the next four months.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.080]   He says, I wanna talk to you about
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.480]   your relationship with me, your relationship with yourself,
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.360]   and your relationship with your wife.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.240]   And He said, nothing else is important.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.040]   And I know you've got all these questions on your heart.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.880]   I know you're asking for me to do so much,
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.520]   but Andrew, actually, only three things really matter.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.160]   And if you wanna be a healthy pastor,
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.800]   and a healthy leader, and a healthy human being,
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.920]   these are the only three things that are on my heart,
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.840]   you and me, you and yourself, you and your wife, Chris.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.640]   And so over those four months, God began to speak to me
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.160]   about how I needed to refresh my relationship with Him,
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.880]   which I desperately needed to do.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.880]   I realized that I had become a bit dry,
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.280]   and that my relationship with God
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.320]   was driven more by the job I had,
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.080]   rather than the joy I had to be His son.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.400]   I realized that there was so much
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.840]   of those insecurities within me,
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.760]   which meant that my relationship with myself
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.120]   was not where it should be,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.480]   and I wasn't operating out of a place of confidence
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.120]   in being a son of God.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.600]   And instead, other things were getting in the way.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.720]   And I realized, and this was the one
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.560]   that really opened my spirit up,
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.880]   and really kinda just changed my heart,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.760]   I realized that my marriage was not where it should be.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.280]   I realized it was because I had been so selfish,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.240]   that there was a selfishness in me,
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.680]   which meant that so oftentimes,
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.120]   my wife got the worst part of me out of my day than the best.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.680]   And I realized that as a typical pastor,
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.280]   there was that cliche that I was putting ministry
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.160]   over the home, and that that needed to change,
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.840]   and God was concerned about that.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.080]   One of the things I wrote in my diary about my wife
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.640]   is God basically said to me,
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.240]   "You do not have any idea the power that there is
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.320]   "and the gift that I've given you in Chris."
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.000]   And so there was a journey for me
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.240]   in rediscovering the wonder of my wife.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.040]   I love my wife, and I always have loved my wife,
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.680]   but this deepening expression of what it is to be with her.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.840]   And so I was hoping to come back
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.640]   with some great revelation for you,
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.360]   but what I return with is simply a great relationship,
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.560]   great relationship with him and with myself
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.920]   and a growing and better relationship with my wife.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.240]   Without sounding too cheesy about it,
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.200]   and I don't apologize for it,
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.560]   here's the reality, I really, really love Jesus again.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.280]   Like, I really do.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.400]   I feel like my whole life has shifted
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.160]   into this new place of peace,
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   because there's a vibrancy and a beauty and a wonder
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.720]   of a daily falling in love with Jesus again.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.800]   And it's weird, but it's because I spent
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.080]   so much time with Jesus.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.400]   I mean, one of the things I did on my sabbatical
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.600]   was this thing called the Camino de Santiago.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.960]   The Camino de Santiago is a 34-day walking pilgrimage.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.840]   It's 800 kilometers from this place in France
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.360]   called Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   to Santiago de Compostela in the west coast of Spain.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.520]   And this journey takes about 34 days.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.280]   You're walking on average about 25 kilometers a day,
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.680]   so that's anywhere from about five to seven hours
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.480]   of walking with a big, heavy backpack on every day.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.000]   As you walk, you can be in a place of solitude.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.800]   Oftentimes, you're walking on your own.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.360]   You may not see another human being for a couple of hours.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.600]   You visit churches throughout the day.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.040]   Sometimes at night, you'll stay in churches.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.360]   The churches will open up their place
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.760]   and you can sleep on the floor of the church.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.360]   You're basically doing a pilgrimage
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.840]   from one place to another.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.440]   And the reason why the Camino is so famous
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.880]   and such a sacred space is because it was first walked
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.840]   in 812, not 1812, 812, in the ninth century.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.960]   They were actually disciples of the Apostle James
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.520]   and they had what they believed
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.600]   were the bones of the Apostle James.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.440]   And so they wanted to take those bones to Santiago,
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.000]   so they walked the bones from the south of France
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.560]   all the way to Santiago.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.860]   And that journey that they did is exactly the same path
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.880]   that you now walk when you do the Camino Frances in Spain.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.100]   And it was a great privilege to be able to walk every day
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.720]   with no other responsibilities other than to spend
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.480]   about five, six, seven hours in and out of prayer
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.520]   and in the company of Jesus.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.040]   It was such a beautiful thing.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.120]   I don't know if you're anything like me,
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.080]   but usually when I spend more time with people,
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.920]   I actually like them less.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.680]   Is anyone ever like that?
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.320]   You know when you spend more time with people
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.080]   and you come to discover that actually
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.720]   they're not the people that you thought they were, right?
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.360]   Or you spend more time with people
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.240]   and then you discover that actually your flaws
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.160]   and your brokenness is kind of reflected in them
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.120]   and you kind of actually don't like yourself around them,
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.280]   right, or maybe you spend time with them
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.480]   and you had put them on a pedestal
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.700]   and you thought they would be like this
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.240]   and yet when you spent more time with them,
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.960]   you realize they're not quite the human being
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.800]   I thought they were.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.760]   We often, when we spend more time with people,
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.060]   don't like them as much.
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.100]   It is not like that with Jesus.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.040]   See, when you spend more time with Jesus,
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.720]   you cannot help but fall more in love with him
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.280]   'cause he's all grace and love and kindness and mercy
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.840]   and you get to see him in different ways
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.440]   and you get to experience his voice in your life
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.280]   like never before.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.640]   And even though at times that voice is challenging
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.360]   and not always easy to hear,
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.200]   it's always from a place of love to form and to shape you
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.640]   into the person he's created you to be
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.160]   and when you spend copious amounts of time with Jesus,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.520]   you're only going to love him more
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.600]   and so I return to you not with some great revelation
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.980]   but simply a love of Christ.
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:11.920]   Now, I know what some of you are probably thinking
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.380]   as you sit there.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.000]   You're thinking, well, that's all well and good
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.460]   for you, Andrew.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.240]   You had four months off.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.700]   You had a sabbatical.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.020]   Oh, isn't that nice?
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.140]   Give me four months off work, put a backpack on me
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.540]   and send me to Spain and have all that nice food
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.380]   and all that nice wine, I would love Jesus more too.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.980]   You know what?
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.140]   You would be right.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.080]   You would love Jesus more.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.860]   And so although I've had this amazing experience
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.620]   on this Camino and during my sabbatical
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.380]   and I come back to you and say, I love Jesus more,
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.260]   you're sitting there like, yeah, that's great for you
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.980]   but what about me?
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.580]   And I hear that and I think this actually raises
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.020]   one of the most important questions
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.220]   that we all have to wrestle with.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:01.220]   How do I deepen my love with Jesus in my normal life?
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.600]   Like in the normal busyness and stress
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.660]   and all the responsibilities I have,
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.460]   how do I deepen my love for Jesus in the here and the now,
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.740]   in the craziness of Hong Kong and in the work
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.140]   that I have to do and the responsibilities that I have
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.860]   and the grind that I'm in?
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.480]   How do I recapture, refresh something of a passion
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.940]   for Jesus in the here and the now?
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.260]   And that's what is on my heart for you as I do return.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.460]   I wanna share today but also in a number
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.660]   of one-off messages in 2025, some answers to that question,
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.020]   ways in which I think all of us can actually deepen
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.780]   and refresh in our relationship with Jesus
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.820]   without having to go away for four months
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.900]   and do a sabbatical.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.600]   I hope at some point you do get a chance
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.740]   to do the sabbatical and I highly recommend the Camino
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.800]   if you ever do.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.860]   But isn't it the point of Christian discipleship
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.580]   that we flourish and grow in Him
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.040]   in the moments of everyday life?
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.100]   So what I wanna do today is share the first
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.220]   of these ideas with you.
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.880]   And what I wanna share with you today,
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.180]   I believe actually has the power to shift so much
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.860]   of your thinking about God and who He is in your life.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.220]   In fact, so much of perhaps shifting your relationship
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.600]   with Him that I think if you put into practice this week
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.540]   the things we're about to talk about,
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.880]   I do genuinely believe that you will have
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.340]   a revolutionized relationship with Jesus.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.140]   I think what I'm about to talk about is that important.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.820]   So I wanna pray, I wanna pray that you open your ears
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.100]   and my ears will open too to what the Holy Spirit
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.760]   wants to say, is that okay?
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.600]   Let's pray.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.680]   And let us ask that as we come into this moment now,
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.320]   that Father, you would open our ears and our eyes
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.240]   to see you in new and fresh ways.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.120]   Lord, we long to love you more.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.480]   And Father, we pray that we would be able
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.420]   to do this together as a community.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.280]   We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.380]   To introduce you to this little tip
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.180]   or this little way of thinking,
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.040]   let me tell you a story about what happened to me
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.040]   whilst I was on the Camino.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.680]   The Camino, as I said, is 800 kilometers long
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.600]   and the majority of the time you're walking
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.800]   in rural parts of Spain, beautiful environments.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.000]   And you might come across a couple of villages
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.360]   as you're walking throughout the day.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.160]   And like I say, you could walk for hours
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.440]   without really even seeing another human being.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.580]   But throughout the walk, you actually come
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.000]   to a number of cities during those 800 kilometers.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.120]   Pamplona, where they do the chasing of the bulls,
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.760]   a place called Legrono, Burgos, and then one city,
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.180]   which is about 500 kilometers into the walk.
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.660]   So for me, that was about three weeks into walking.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.120]   It's called Leon.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.040]   And Leon is one of the largest cities
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.440]   that you come across during the walk.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.400]   There's about 200,000 people that live in Leon.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.840]   And it was interesting 'cause just before Leon,
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.480]   I'd been walking for about a week and a half,
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.640]   a lot of it on my own, and I'd been
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.000]   in a beautiful place of solitude.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.400]   Now, I'm an extrovert with a capital E,
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.520]   but it was amazing for me to be in this rural environment,
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.160]   spending a lot of time with Jesus.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.960]   And it felt so good that when I entered into Leon that day,
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.680]   and there's like 200,000 people living
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.680]   in this hustling, bustling city,
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.960]   it was very jarring for me.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.540]   And I actually didn't really enjoy it,
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.880]   even though I normally love big cities.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.840]   And I was like, I'm so kind of synced in to this thing here
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.180]   that this big city now is kind of a little bit annoying.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.720]   And I made the decision that night
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.400]   that I was gonna wake up earlier the next day,
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.400]   earlier than I normally do,
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.840]   and I was just gonna start walking.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.520]   I wanted to get out of Leon
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.480]   and get back into those rural moments.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.520]   And so I did, I normally would start walking
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.760]   about eight in the morning this day.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.400]   I started walking about seven in the morning.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.520]   And as I'm walking, I'm in urban Leon,
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.600]   so just busy streets, I'm walking along.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.840]   And as I'm walking, I see this man,
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.440]   and he's on like an electric scooter.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.420]   You know those like little scooters, not the big ones,
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.800]   but just like those little electric ones
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.860]   where you can zip into a city.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.900]   So he's riding one of those, and he starts shouting.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.840]   Now, I couldn't tell from where I was
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.960]   and where he was at the time what he was shouting,
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.240]   but it sounded like, "Nasdaq, Nasdaq," like this, okay?
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.760]   Which, I don't speak Spanish,
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.300]   but I figure he's saying something in Spanish.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.120]   I figure he's saying, "Get out of my way,"
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.600]   'cause he was coming pretty quick at me.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.320]   So I kind of moved with my backpack out the way,
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.240]   and I kind of stood against the wall like this
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.760]   so that he had ample room to zip by me.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.640]   But he zipped right straight up to me.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.120]   He looks me in the eye, and he goes,
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.640]   "Pastor, Pastor Andrew, Pastor Andrew from the Vine."
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.980]   And I'm like, "I can never get away!"
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.220]   No, I'm just kidding, I didn't say it.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.500]   I was like, "Yes, yes, I am Pastor Andrew."
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.140]   I hadn't thought about myself like that for a while,
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.940]   but "Pastor Andrew from the Vine, yes I am."
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.780]   He's like, "Oh, I cannot believe it!"
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.980]   Anyway, turns out his name is Emmanuel.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.900]   And Emmanuel was one of our asylum seekers
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.100]   who was a part of our refugee ministry back in 2018.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.780]   Him and his family had come here from West Africa,
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.820]   and for four years they had lived in Hong Kong,
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.900]   and we had helped them,
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.660]   and they had been a part of the Vine community.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.780]   They'd been part of our asylum seeker and refugee ministry.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.340]   This is Emmanuel here.
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.540]   And he was on his way that morning to work,
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.540]   because what had happened in 2018
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.660]   is that him and his family had gotten their refugee status,
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.740]   and they were moving from Hong Kong to Spain.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.700]   So they left Hong Kong, they went to Spain.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.740]   They decided to settle in this little town in Leon,
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.220]   and he has a business there.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.660]   And he's scooting on his way to work.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.940]   And actually, interesting, that morning,
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.940]   he was a little bit late leaving his house,
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.660]   so he was scootering quite quickly to try to get to work.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.220]   And then as he's scootering down this road
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.700]   that he scoots down every single day
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.380]   for whatever number of years it had been,
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.180]   he looks and he's like, "That looks like Pastor Andrew."
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.940]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.740]   And he comes straight up to me, he's like, "Pastor Andrew!"
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.900]   So he's like freaking out, and I'm freaking out,
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.260]   and we took a photo, and we prayed for each other,
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.980]   and it was like the most amazing thing.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.020]   'Cause I realized if I had decided to have left my hostel
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.020]   a minute before or a minute after,
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.540]   we would have missed each other.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.500]   If he hadn't been running late for work that day,
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.620]   he probably wouldn't have driven down
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.580]   that particular street at that particular time.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.700]   I mean, this is one of those moments in life
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.060]   where you know God is present, amen?
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.380]   Like it's like all these things,
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.380]   all of these complicated things have all come together
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.420]   for some reason that I would be walking on that street,
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.860]   he would be scootering on that street,
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.380]   and we had a great conversation.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.860]   I prayed for him, and he prayed for me,
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.260]   and I left there as he said goodbye and scooted off,
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.420]   and I kept walking.
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.220]   I left there thinking like, "Man, isn't God good?
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.900]   "That God would orchestrate all of this
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.460]   "so that I would know that God is with me."
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:41.820]   About 10 minutes later, and only the way that God does,
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.820]   God kinda comes up alongside of me.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.780]   You ever felt like God's come alongside of you?
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.660]   No, okay.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.740]   So God comes up alongside of me, and he's like,
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.060]   "Andrew," he's like, "It's funny, isn't it?"
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.540]   I'm like, "What?"
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.380]   He's like, "It's funny, isn't it?
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.060]   "Because that whole moment with Emmanuel and Leon,"
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.100]   he's like, "That's just often how you think
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.460]   "about my presence too."
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.860]   I'm like, "What do you mean?"
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.740]   He's like, "Well, you think that half the time
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.940]   "me meeting you is like some random encounter.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.260]   "You think you have to orchestrate all this stuff
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.900]   "in order for me to be present in your life.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.060]   "In fact, you think that my presence in your life
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.460]   "is so random and so rare that when it does happen,
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.380]   "you have to stop and say, 'Oh God,
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.380]   "'thank you for reminding me that you're with me.'"
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.740]   And I felt like God was beginning to unpack something
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.420]   that was deeply important for me,
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.820]   and I wanna unpack this a little bit for you today,
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.020]   'cause I think this will help to shift some things for you.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.900]   I realize that so often my relationship with God
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.260]   is built on these, what I would call,
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.460]   random occurrences or bumping into God.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.860]   Like I feel like I have to work really hard
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.300]   to feel like I'm in the presence of God sometimes.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.060]   Does any of you ever feel that way?
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.580]   In fact, I know that many of you feel that way,
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.620]   'cause as I've been leading here for so many years,
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.940]   I know that so many of you have shared that with me.
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.900]   "Oh, Pastor Andrew, I really struggle
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.420]   "to sense the presence of God in my life."
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.180]   Or, "Pastor Andrew, I wish I sensed God's presence
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.580]   "like everybody else at the Vine."
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.540]   "Oh, Pastor Andrew, I came to church this week
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.780]   "and I was raising my hands and looking around,
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.980]   "but I didn't feel like God was with me."
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.700]   And so often I think as Christians,
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.020]   we can wrestle with this thought
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.020]   that we're trying as best we can to meet with God
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.460]   and have God meet with us,
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.460]   and we often can feel like He's distant or away from us.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:35.100]   I wonder for you, does it ever feel like with God
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.780]   that He's more a random encounter
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.780]   than a constant presence in your life?
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.300]   Does it ever feel like that way for you?
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.260]   That maybe He's more like you bump into Him
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.460]   every once in a while in your life,
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.820]   rather than the reality that He is constantly there with you?
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.700]   I know that's how I have felt often,
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.180]   but I also know that that is not true,
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.100]   that God is always present with us at all times
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.980]   and in all ways.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.380]   But the reality is as Christians,
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.380]   I think we can so often kind of disregard that,
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.140]   and we can so often think that He's actually distant from us,
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.500]   that He's not near us,
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.500]   and sometimes even our language can interrupt that.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.500]   Even our language can begin to suggest
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.660]   that He is distant and away from us.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.340]   As God was unpacking this for me,
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.060]   I was beginning to see that actually even some of the things
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.780]   that I say here at the Vine and how I lead sometimes
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.540]   actually plays into a faulty theology
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.420]   that we have to somehow invoke God's presence
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.460]   in order to meet with Him.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.580]   I wonder if you've ever heard anybody up front at church
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.820]   say something like this.
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.220]   "Lord Jesus, this morning we invite Your presence
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.100]   to be with us."
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.820]   You ever heard that at church?
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.020]   Or perhaps you prayed something similar to that
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.940]   in your own heart in private.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.940]   "Oh Lord, would You just come and meet me today?
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.220]   I'm nervous about this work,
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.860]   and I just invite Your Holy Spirit to come and be with me
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.860]   so that I can get through this thing in my job."
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.340]   We have this language as Christians at times
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.620]   of this idea of inviting the presence of God
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.860]   or inviting the Holy Spirit into our lives.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.780]   And here's the issue with that, I think,
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.660]   that although there's language there,
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.100]   and maybe it's just semantics,
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.500]   but when we constantly are thinking
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.900]   that we have to invite God,
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.260]   what it really communicates
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.420]   is that we don't think God is there.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.300]   Come on, church.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.660]   I mean, think about it this way, right?
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.060]   Like the reason why you invite someone
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.980]   is because they are not currently present.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.860]   This is why we've created these amazing invites for you
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.780]   for Christmas Day.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.180]   We want you to write the name of someone on here
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.180]   who, guess what, doesn't normally come to the Vine.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.140]   And so you can invite them to be here, are you with me?
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.500]   But it's funny because our language in church
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.180]   so often seems to back up this idea
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.700]   that God, I'm inviting you,
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.340]   which essentially means before I did that, you weren't here.
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.860]   Like I have to somehow position myself
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.780]   in order to try to get Your Spirit and Your presence to me.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.100]   I think the second thing that this issue creates for us
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.740]   is that it kind of makes us think
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.540]   that God's presence is our determination and not His.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:18.380]   In other words, that I'm responsible in some ways
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.500]   for trying to get God's presence
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.420]   either in my life or in some situation.
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.260]   And that puts a huge amount of pressure on us.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.740]   And when it feels like for us that God is still distant,
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.700]   we think something's either wrong with us
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.260]   or we think something's wrong with God.
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.340]   And so we try to stir up within ourselves
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.540]   even more effort to try to create God's presence
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.740]   to just come 'cause He's obviously not here.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.180]   This is what we see actually happen
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.420]   in 1 Kings 18, verse 27.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.180]   And I love how Elijah is saying this.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.420]   This is the moment where Elijah's up on the mountain
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.860]   and he's speaking to the prophets of Baal
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.700]   and they're trying to call down God to respond.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.540]   He says this, he says,
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.700]   "At noon, Elijah began to taunt them.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.420]   "'Shout louder,' he said.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.700]   "'Surely He is a God.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.420]   "'Perhaps He is in deep thought,
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.660]   "'or He's busy, or He's traveling.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.300]   "'Maybe He's sleeping and must be awakened.'"
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.300]   I love the way that Elijah taunts them in this,
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:15.140]   but I read this and I think, man, I think we do this a lot.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.500]   Like we think if we just shout louder,
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.940]   if we just try more, if we just hype things up,
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.420]   then God's presence may come and change everything.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.900]   And God's standing to the side saying,
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.700]   "Don't you realize that I'm already here in my fullness?
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.860]   "Don't you realize that it's actually
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.260]   "not about you inviting me,
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.660]   "it's actually about me who's invited you?"
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:37.620]   The third thing I think it does is it causes us to think
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.580]   that some places are more sacred than others.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.700]   Because in church, when we gather in a building like this
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.060]   and we invite God's presence to come,
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.500]   it's amazing, we can all feel Him.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.220]   But when I wake up tomorrow and I go to work,
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.420]   I realize that He's not in that place.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.460]   And I realize that, thank God that God has me there
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.500]   because I can bring the presence of God into that place.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.500]   And God's like, "Hmm, I was there a lot longer
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.980]   "than you were, and I will be there
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.540]   "a lot longer after you left.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.580]   "Because my presence is all here right now in its fullness."
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.060]   And actually the job of a Christian
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.300]   is not to try to invite God to come and do something.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.420]   Perhaps the job of the Christian is to realize
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.020]   that God is already at work, already at play,
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.140]   already doing so much, and our role is not
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.420]   about inviting something that isn't there.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.580]   Our role is about walking into something that truly is.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.020]   And that if you can get that shift in your thinking,
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.900]   and it's a small, subtle thing,
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.180]   but if you can get that shift in your thinking,
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.660]   you're beginning to redefine your relationship with Him.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.980]   That your encounter with the presence of God
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.140]   is not reserved for 90 minutes on a Sunday
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.780]   or community group during the week,
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.660]   or in those moments when you pray,
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:52.340]   but every single moment is alive with the glory of God.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.660]   It's fascinating.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.300]   If you study the New Testament,
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.540]   and if you look at the word inviting when it relates to God,
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.940]   it only in the New Testament ever shows up in two contexts.
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.820]   The first context is the invitation of the Holy Spirit
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.060]   to come at the moment of salvation.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.160]   When we invite Jesus to come and be a part of our lives,
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.700]   when we invite Jesus to come and forgive us of our sins,
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.120]   and to wash us clean, and restore and renew us,
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.840]   the New Testament speaks a lot about inviting God
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.300]   to be in us and with us in the moment of salvation.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.940]   That's context number one.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.540]   The second context is the one
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.700]   that we're gonna be looking at at Advent.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.420]   It's the context of inviting God
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.140]   to come at the end of all things,
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.820]   to make everything right, to come in His second coming,
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.100]   and establish heaven on earth,
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.520]   to restore and make all things new.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.220]   The prayers in the Bible about the Spirit of God coming
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.540]   is always in relation to the second coming of Christ.
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.660]   And so you have this moment
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.060]   where they invite God for salvation,
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.200]   they're inviting God to come in the second coming,
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.460]   but in between, they're not inviting God
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.220]   to show up at every church meeting.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.380]   And they're not doing that
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.740]   because they have a theology that tells them
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.860]   that the fullness of Christ is both within me
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:07.860]   and in the world.
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.100]   This is the beauty of the New Testament,
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.740]   that it teaches that when you come into salvation
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:15.620]   with Christ Jesus, the fullness of God's presence,
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.680]   think of this, the fullness of His presence
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.020]   comes and lives within you.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.340]   Paul speaks about this so much,
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.340]   there's passages throughout,
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.000]   in fact, we've just thrown up a few on the screen here,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.020]   you can look at.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.820]   The idea of being the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.300]   Paul says, don't you realize that the same Spirit
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.460]   that raised Jesus from the dead
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.020]   is the one that's now alive and living in you.
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.020]   It's not like you have a half measure.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.060]   It's not like you have a little bit.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.460]   If you believe that Jesus is your Lord and Savior,
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.460]   the fullness of Christ is in you.
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.220]   The fullness of Him is always in you,
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.820]   regardless of where you are,
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.300]   regardless of what you're doing,
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.200]   regardless of how you're acting,
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   the fullness of His presence is in you.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.020]   For some of you, that should change
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.280]   completely your relationship with Him.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.700]   Because perhaps you've been feeling like you're distant
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.300]   or you're alone and you're feeling like,
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.460]   if only I can invite Him to come,
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.420]   if only He'll respond to my prayers,
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.020]   and He's like, I'm already fully in you.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.060]   The other thing the New Testament says
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.140]   is that He's already fully in the world,
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.860]   that there is not a place that you could go,
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.460]   whether it's the Old Testament or the New Testament,
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.620]   the theme is the same.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:25.060]   There's nowhere you can go or run away from His presence.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.380]   He's omnipresent.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.260]   He's in everything at all times, everywhere.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.820]   And so the New Testament presents to us
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.780]   this picture of the fullness of the Spirit of God in us,
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.100]   the fullness of the Spirit of God around us.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:43.100]   And it teaches us that Christ is fully there in person,
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.060]   when things are going great in your life
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.220]   and when things are not.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.220]   He is there in person, in the stillness and in the storm.
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.840]   He is there in person in your life,
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.380]   when you're on your own or when you're with others.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.060]   He is there in person, whether you're in church on a Sunday
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.900]   or you're in the office on a Monday.
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.300]   It does not change.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.940]   And our relationship with Christ, I think,
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.500]   is so often stilted because we've decided
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.700]   that God is in some places and He's not in others,
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.820]   and we need to spend more time in the places where He is
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.920]   if we wanna grow in relationship with Him.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.880]   And God would say, "Actually, your time in your office
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.340]   "tomorrow could be the most revolutionary time
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.620]   "in your experience with me than anything ever before,
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.420]   "'cause I'm in you fully,
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:37.560]   "and I'm around you fully at all times."
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.120]   So let me be real clear.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.420]   We don't make God show up.
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.000]   Think of the arrogance that is there in thinking
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.640]   that we somehow control the presence of God.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.220]   God decides in His authority where He is,
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.560]   and He's everywhere all the time.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.260]   So here's the really important thing,
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.220]   and I want you to track with this.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.100]   When it comes to the presence of God in your life,
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.540]   the issue is not inviting something that isn't there.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:09.540]   The issue is in becoming more aware of what already is.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.060]   Come on, church, are you following this?
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.420]   The issue is not in trying to invite something
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.700]   that isn't there because that puts the onus on you.
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.120]   That makes you central,
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.380]   and everything else is kind of revolving around you.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.740]   The issue instead is just about becoming more aware
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.660]   of everything that already is,
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.300]   the fullness of His presence in you,
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.300]   the fullness of His presence around you in everything,
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.500]   and as you see it and encounter it,
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.340]   and you become more aware of it,
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.060]   it changes everything for you.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:41.000]   And suddenly you realize that your life is a joy,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.580]   that your life is something to walk into boldly
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.480]   and confidently because you've got Him in you
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.180]   and around you at all times,
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.980]   regardless of what's happening.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.820]   And because of that, you begin to shift
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.860]   how you think you should act and be,
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.580]   that your role in relationship to Christ
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.860]   is not one of delivery.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.380]   Lord, I deliver your Holy Spirit to this moment.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.300]   Your role is one of discovery.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.100]   Lord, I ask that you make me aware
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.380]   of all of the amazing things that you're currently doing
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.680]   with this group of people.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:18.520]   Your role shifts from invitation, come Holy Spirit,
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.440]   and it shifts to subjugation.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.480]   I recognize that you are here in your fullness,
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.160]   Holy Spirit, and I now come to you.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.640]   Like Pastor Ellison was talking about last week,
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.620]   I deny myself, lay down, I pick up my cross,
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.800]   and I follow you.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.060]   I come to you.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.800]   The joy that there is inside of us
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.500]   to know that we are never aligned,
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.280]   that even though sometimes we may not feel it,
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.120]   even though sometimes we don't think it,
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:50.680]   God is always present, and that changes everything.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:53.680]   I just sense for some of you, that's gonna free you,
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.660]   free you from the chains of performance and religion,
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:03.660]   and put you in a different place of relationship.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.520]   The question is, how do we do this?
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.000]   How do we actually become more consciously aware
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.680]   of his presence in our lives?
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.860]   Well, let me offer you three quick things as I close.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:17.660]   Here's the first thing, embrace thanksgiving.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.540]   Embrace thanksgiving.
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.860]   Psalm 100, verse four says,
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.340]   "We enter his gates with thanksgiving on our heart.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.780]   "We enter into his presence
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.140]   "with this reality of thanking him."
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.660]   What thanksgiving does is it subverts
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.300]   any tendency of pride in us.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.040]   Thanksgiving kind of subverts any sense
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.060]   of entitlement we might have.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:41.820]   When we walk in a general idea of thanksgiving,
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.960]   thanking God for everything that is happening
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.520]   in and around our lives, it frees us so much,
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.840]   and it enables us to begin to see God
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.560]   in the things that we never thought
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.100]   we'd be able to see him in before.
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.400]   In the Beatitudes, it says that,
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.040]   "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God."
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.120]   And I think the number one way that you purify your heart,
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.940]   other than, of course, inviting the cleansing of forgiveness
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.840]   and the repentance of sin, the second beautiful way
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.960]   of purifying your heart is acting in thankfulness.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.000]   As you walk in gratitude, man,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.620]   this is annoying my wife, by the way.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.600]   I am so thankful for everything right now.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.640]   She's like, "Would you just tone down
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.740]   "the thankfulness, please?"
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.560]   But I tell you what, somebody cuts me off
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.620]   when I'm driving, and I'm like,
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.320]   "Oh my God, thank you, Lord, so much for that person.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.900]   "I had cold pizza yesterday.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.560]   "Thank you, Lord, for cold pizza."
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.600]   I'm thankful for the things
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.340]   that I would never be thankful for before,
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.540]   because when you begin to walk in a place
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:42.540]   of thankfulness for everything, you will see God,
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.340]   where you thought you would never see him before.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.600]   The second thing is this, be careful,
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.060]   keep an eye on your language,
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.040]   because, you see, language shapes culture.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.380]   And if amongst ourselves, we are practicing
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.780]   the language of invitation to God all the time,
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.860]   we're actually kinda communicating something
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.340]   that we probably don't wanna be communicating.
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.280]   And while, of course, it's great to have a heart
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.100]   to wanna receive more and to be more in his presence,
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.240]   perhaps as we shift our language,
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.220]   we'll begin to shift our expectations,
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.940]   and maybe some of that negative stuff
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.980]   that hangs around the invitation language
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.580]   about being alone or God being distant
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.060]   or having to try to control him in some way,
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.340]   we might actually begin to walk in more freedom
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.460]   than we've ever walked before.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.260]   So guard your language.
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.460]   The third thing is this, guard your awareness.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.140]   Because if this is all about becoming more aware
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.040]   to what is already within us and around us,
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.460]   then what are the things that still are awareness
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.100]   of the presence of God in our lives?
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.140]   Those are the things we should be wrestling with.
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.340]   And so I have an exercise that I wanna encourage
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.100]   all of you to do this week.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.780]   And if you do this, I believe that this will change
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.780]   how you approach your daily walk with Jesus.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.660]   It's a very simple exercise.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:59.500]   First of all, you ask yourself,
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.620]   "What helps me pay attention to God?"
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.420]   Write a list down, the things that help me
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:05.340]   to be connected to him.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.540]   Maybe it's worship music, maybe it's prayer,
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.440]   maybe it's whatever, walking in the wilderness,
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.280]   whatever it might be.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.780]   But what is it that helps me to connect with him?
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.740]   Second question, what hinders me
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.680]   from paying attention to him?
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.180]   In other words, what gets in the way?
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:22.180]   What distracts, what pulls me in the opposite direction?
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.980]   Your answer to those two questions
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.040]   will change your relationship with him.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.700]   And so if you're willing to do this,
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.540]   I would also encourage you,
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.220]   if you're part of one of our small group communities,
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.460]   our community groups here,
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.700]   take this and bring it into your community group as well.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.780]   And share with them, "Here's my list of things
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.500]   "that helps me to connect with Jesus.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.920]   "Here's the things that kinda distract me from that.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.900]   "Could you pray for me?"
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.660]   Let's talk about these together.
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.460]   And let's commit each other to recognizing
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.020]   that his presence is here.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.460]   Somebody once described the Camino
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.500]   as an 800 kilometer cathedral.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.060]   And that's how it felt for me.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.280]   As I was walking in the rural areas of Spain,
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.140]   I was outdoors, sometimes it was raining,
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.740]   sometimes it was sunny, sometimes I was happy,
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.360]   sometimes I was a little bit frustrated,
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.980]   sometimes I was super tired.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.420]   Other times I had lots of energy.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.460]   All different emotions.
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.660]   It didn't matter where my emotional state was.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.940]   I always felt like I was in the presence
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:15.980]   of the almighty king.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.220]   It was a beautiful thing.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.300]   Guess what?
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.860]   I came back to Hong Kong last week.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.020]   On the day I got back, I walked in Causeway Bay.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:27.000]   And I was like, this is a cathedral also.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.500]   It's a different kind of cathedral
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.980]   than the one that I've been walking in Spain.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:37.840]   But it is no less filled with the wonder and glory of Jesus.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.100]   May you change the way that you think
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.440]   about your workplace, about the streets of our city.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:48.220]   May we change the way we think about the presence of God.
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.180]   That we might actually be rebirthed,
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.900]   a freshness in our relationship with him
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.600]   because we see him and feel him in all things.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.940]   One of my favorite theologians is the 20th century
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.400]   British theologian C.S. Lewis.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.140]   Let me read you how he said this.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:06.500]   He says this, "We may ignore, but we can nowhere evade
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.780]   "the presence of God.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.560]   "The world is crowded with him.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.900]   "He walks everywhere incognito.
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:15.060]   "And the incognito is not always hard to penetrate.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.380]   "The real labor is to remember to attend.
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:23.380]   "In fact, to come and awake, still more to remain awake.
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.520]   "My desire as I come back as your pastor
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.320]   "is that I will honor and serve you
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.240]   "by remaining awake to this love of Jesus
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.160]   "that is now within me.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.420]   "And my prayer for you, as us as a community,
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:39.660]   "is that we would awaken more and more to his presence."
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.340]   In the name of Jesus, everyone says.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.500]   - Amen. - Amen.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.660]   Would you stand with me, I'd love to pray for you.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.420]   (pages rustling)
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:53.100]   And I just wanna invite you just to quieten your heart.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.620]   (gentle music)
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.460]   And if this has been a helpful message for you
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.200]   this morning, this afternoon,
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.440]   and if it's something that has resonated with you,
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.460]   I just want us, our eyes are closed.
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.220]   Here at the Vine, we just do a simple posture
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.780]   of just opening our hands before the Lord.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.700]   It's just nothing magical in it.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.100]   It's just our way of signaling to the Holy Spirit
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.460]   that we're open for his ministry.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.060]   By opening our hands, we're not inviting his presence
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.780]   to the room, 'cause of everything
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.580]   we've just been talking about.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.220]   But by opening our hands, we are saying
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.460]   that our hearts are open,
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:26.900]   that we are inviting, if you will,
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.420]   the ministry of the Spirit
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:34.940]   to come and to do some work within us.
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.460]   And so if that's for you this morning,
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.540]   this afternoon, just open your hands, let me pray.
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.460]   Father, as we stand before you now,
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.460]   we just quieten ourselves down.
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:47.060]   I wanna encourage each one of you now in this moment
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.900]   just to take,
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.620]   take some silence,
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:56.740]   and just begin to think about the fullness
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.340]   of Christ's presence within you.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.500]   Not one of you in this room,
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.260]   if you believe in Jesus, are alone.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.860]   It's a lie of the enemy
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.500]   to make you feel like you are distant from him.
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.300]   (gentle music)
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:17.380]   He is here in his fullness in you in this moment.
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.540]   So just take a moment for some of you
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.740]   just to reflect on that.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:26.460]   Not only that, but he's in his fullness around you
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.420]   in this moment, in all moments.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.460]   He is everywhere.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.900]   And he's inviting you
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.660]   to be awakened more and more to his activity
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.460]   that is at work around your life.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:47.980]   So as you're just taking a moment in calm
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.460]   just to recognize his presence in you,
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.900]   to recognize his presence around you,
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:59.100]   I wonder whether you just begin to be thankful.
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.380]   Just begin to offer thanksgiving in your heart.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:09.300]   Just thank him that the promises of Scripture are true,
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.620]   that you are a temple of the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.500]   Thank him that the same Spirit
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.700]   that raised Jesus from the dead is in you.
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:23.180]   Thank him that you are fully in Christ as Christ is in you.
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:30.380]   And then begin to thank him that he loves your colleagues
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.380]   and your office and your place of employment
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.940]   and your apartment building and your family
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.780]   and the streets and neighborhoods of the city.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.740]   He loves these places and is present in those places
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.980]   in profoundly important ways.
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:52.100]   Just begin to thank him that he is there.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:58.940]   And then in that place of gratitude,
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.220]   I wanna pray that you would receive
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.620]   what he has for you tonight.
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.500]   So Holy Spirit, have your way.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:14.300]   Don't feel like you need to rush this moment.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:20.980]   Just allow the joy of the Lord
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.060]   to be rebirthed in some of you.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.580]   I felt this in one of the earlier services,
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:26.420]   but I feel it again now.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.540]   For some of you, it's been a while
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:31.540]   since you felt any joy in your relationship with Christ.
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.340]   One of the great fruits of the Spirit is joy,
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.260]   love, peace and joy.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.100]   I love joy and peace.
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.300]   And so joy is this incredible fruit of the Spirit
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.540]   that's available for you.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:47.140]   So Lord, I wanna pray for a rebirthing of joy
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.100]   as some people here take that step of reshifting
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.220]   how they think about you and your presence.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.660]   As they become more awoken to the reality
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.460]   of your presence in their lives,
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.500]   Lord, I pray that joy would come in the name of Jesus.
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.740]   That joy would be a great breakthrough.
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:09.500]   So just, Lord, would you be at work?
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.460]   So just allow the Spirit of God
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.340]   to do whatever he wants to do
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.020]   as we respond together in worship.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.620]   (gentle music)
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.220]   (gentle music)
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.800]   (gentle music)
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   [MUSIC]
