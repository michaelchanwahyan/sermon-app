[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Amen.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Thank you, Ivan.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Wow.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   So much incredible things happening today.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   So exciting.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.440]   Now, when I was in seminary, one of the requirements was that I did an internship to graduate.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.180]   And I was in a missions track, so I decided to seek opportunities in other countries.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.520]   And so one of them that presented itself to me was that I could do my internship in India
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.940]   with a missions organization.
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.140]   Now the cool thing was that at the same time, one of my professors who had used to live
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.280]   in India, he was also running a class for a month all over India, learning from different
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.780]   NGOs and organizations and pastors about the work that they were doing, the challenges
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.480]   that they were facing, and so I was able to join that.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.840]   So part of one of those classes was that we were in Calcutta and we were going to volunteer
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.340]   in the home of the dying with Mother Teresa.
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.100]   So actually she already had passed away, but you know what, she had established.
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.180]   And so I went through some training, you know, we got prepared, and then we stepped into
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.340]   the home of the dying.
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.280]   And I have to tell you, I was not ready for what we stepped into.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.520]   So I stepped into the room and there was a floor, a big hall just filled with people
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.280]   laying on little mats and beds, you know, all throughout that hall.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.420]   And it was groaning in pain, and everybody seemed to know what they were doing.
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.100]   There were some people who were massaging some of those who were in their last moments
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.100]   of their lives.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.040]   There were some who were feeding people, some who were giving medication, some who seemed
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.280]   to be changing beds, but I didn't know what to do.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.080]   So this was a long time ago, I don't remember exactly, but I felt like I just stood there
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.080]   for 15 minutes not knowing what to do.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.080]   And so then finally I connected with one of the people, you know, laying on the mat, and
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.640]   somebody told me, "Oh, he likes a massage."
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.600]   So I started massaging him a bit, and then the only thing I knew how to do was I'm going
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.500]   to sing him a song.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.560]   So I sang a song, you know, just to this man that I met for the first time, and just sang
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.960]   a song to him, and he seemed to enjoy that.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.480]   And then one of the sisters came and they gave me some pills and some water, and I had
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.840]   to, you know, lift him up a bit, put the pills in his mouth and help him swallow the pills.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.440]   Now as I went through that experience, I was wondering, you know, what brought all these
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   people here?
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.520]   You know, what's their life story?
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.180]   How did they get here?
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.760]   How did they get to this point of being here in this room?
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.240]   You know, was there some injustice in society?
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.640]   Was there, you know, were they orphaned?
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.080]   Was all the family, they lost touch with family?
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   You know, what happened?
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.660]   And I'm sure that everybody's story was different, that it was not the same story.
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.020]   But at the same time, I was also inspired because of what Mother Teresa had done.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:29.140]   You know, that she saw a need, people dying in isolation, alone, in fear, being homeless.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.280]   And so she created a home, and I love this name, a home for the dying.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.780]   She gave them dignity, and she gave them love and care, and she mobilized resources, mobilized
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.540]   people, and they came and just brought care to people who were in need for care.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.040]   But all this also makes me wonder, you know, how might God want to speak to us what he
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   wants us to see, what he wants us to notice in Yuen Long, in Hong Kong?
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:11.140]   It makes me wonder how God wants to inspire us to be creative for how we care, love, serve
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.900]   the vulnerable, the marginalized, the hurting.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.460]   And it also makes me wonder how might our Christian faith inspire us to lead lives of
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.300]   justice and mercy?
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:32.840]   You know, what's God's heart that he wants to instill in us so we can be people who can
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.240]   see and who can act and who can be creative and who can find solutions to bring care,
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.060]   healing, justice, mercy to those around us?
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.600]   So that's what I want to explore with you today.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.040]   And in order to do that, we are going to look at the redemptive grand narrative of the Bible.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.120]   Now, that's a mouthful, right?
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.020]   The redemptive grand narrative of the Bible.
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:10.280]   And I believe that when we look at that narrative, that we start to see God's heart for justice.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.880]   We can start experiencing God speaking to us about the type of people he's calling us
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.120]   to be and the type of life that he wants us to live.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.520]   Now the redemptive grand narrative of the Bible is a big, big word.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.320]   So I want to actually explain a little bit what that means.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   Like what is that?
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.640]   Now, you know, the Bible is made up of 66 books, different types of literature, lots
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.740]   of different stories, some lists of names.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.560]   There's all sorts of stuff going on.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.720]   And at a first glance, it might not seem like it's all connected, but it is.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.920]   And the way that it's connected is there is an underlying story that ties all these stories,
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.320]   all these narratives, all these different literature, ties them together.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.480]   That's the redemptive grand narrative of Scripture.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.680]   And so what I want to do with you today is, and this is part of Vine DNA, so I'm trying
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.960]   to pass on and instill in us something that is important to us as the Vine, is to look
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:17.280]   with you at this redemptive grand narrative of Scripture to understand and to see God's
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:26.840]   heart, but also God's call for us to be people who act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.840]   with God.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.840]   Does that sound good?
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.840]   Yes.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.840]   I'm not that convinced.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   Does that sound good?
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.920]   Okay.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.400]   Thank you.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.960]   We get to cheer each other on.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.520]   So let me take you to the beginning of the story.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.000]   It's in the first book of the Bible.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.240]   It is in the book of Genesis, the first two chapters.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.080]   So we learn about that God creates the world, that everything in it that he creates is good
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.040]   or very good.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.840]   Now the pinnacle or the crown of his creation are human beings.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.800]   And so I want to read with you some key verses there.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.960]   Genesis 1, verse 27 and 28.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   It says this.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.280]   "So God created mankind in his own image.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.920]   In the image of God he created them.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.760]   Male and female he created them.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.840]   God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.820]   Fill the earth, subdue it, rule over the fish and the sea and the birds and the sky and
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.920]   over every living creature that moves on the ground.'"
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:42.160]   So the biblical narrative highlights that humans carry this special place.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.440]   They are made in the image of God.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:51.000]   They are different from other animals, different from trees, they're different from rocks because
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.280]   they are made in the image of God.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.720]   Now what does the image of God mean?
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.880]   Well, first of all, it means that God has given people dignity and worth, intrinsic
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.880]   worth.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.560]   Every human being has intrinsic worth.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:11.320]   God loves them and he has a purpose for them and that we should treat other human beings
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.720]   with that worth, with that dignity that God has bestowed upon each and every one of us
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:23.360]   regardless of our gender, our race, our cultural background, our socioeconomic status.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.760]   We are made in the image of God.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.760]   We are his image bearers.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.880]   But then secondly, it also means that we're meant to reflect his character.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:37.500]   We're meant to image him in the world and his character is full of justice and goodness
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:44.600]   and mercy and love and we're meant to reflect that in all our relationships.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:50.160]   And so being an image bearer also means that we are representatives of God on this world,
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.400]   that he has entrusted us with ruling.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:00.600]   Now ruling sometimes is understood as being oppressive and exploiting, but it means ruling
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   in line with God's good purposes, with God's definitions of what is good and evil.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.600]   And so when we do that, we actually get to shape and create new things and move them
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:22.540]   along and contribute to the flourishing, the thriving of creation.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.520]   So we are future shapers.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.820]   We get to take things further.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.840]   You could think of it as if an artist starts painting a picture, let's say Michelangelo
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:40.760]   or El Greco or whoever you like, and then suddenly they call you and say, "Hey, Ivan,
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.080]   Pastor Ivan, can you complete this painting for me please?
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.720]   Can you come to my studio?"
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.080]   And what that means, if Ivan says yes to that, it means that now he has this already started
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:10:02.020]   painting and needs to carry it forward consistently with what the creator has done and he needs
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.300]   to move it forward.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.860]   And that's the type of role that God has given us.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:12.780]   We're representatives to move forward, but consistent with his ideas of good and evil
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.060]   to create and shape new things.
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.280]   And when we do that, we also image him as creator.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.000]   And this is known as a cultural mandate in scripture that we find in the beginning of
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.720]   Genesis.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.320]   And there's four particular areas where we're meant to do that.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.520]   So let me look with you at the four relational contexts.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:44.000]   First it's us with God, us with ourselves, us with others, and us with creation.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.740]   So we're meant to contribute to flourishing in all these relational contexts and move
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.740]   them along.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:57.420]   And the best way to describe that is with the word shalom, which is the Hebrew word
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.420]   for peace and means relational wholeness.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.700]   So in all our relationships, they're meant to be whole and we're meant to carry them
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:13.060]   forward to bringing more wholeness, more goodness into these relationships, into this world.
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:18.860]   So I have an image for you that my wife created.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:27.220]   It's created for good.
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.500]   Can we pull up the next image, please?
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.500]   Thank you.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.020]   All right, right here.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.020]   Okay.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.620]   So we are created for good.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:42.200]   And you see here's Adam and Eve, they're in the garden and everything is flourishing
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:48.220]   and thriving and their relationship with God, with themselves, with others, with creation,
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.100]   everything is working out wonderfully.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.780]   So that's what God created us for.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.680]   He created us for good.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.140]   But if we're honest, that's not our experience of the world, is it?
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:09.560]   That everything, all relationships with us, others, creation, ourselves is good.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.300]   And some of us might even be cynical as we're talking about this, like, "Hey, you know,
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.160]   you're talking about this idealistic stuff."
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.160]   But that's not my experience.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.860]   You know, there's a lot of pain, there's breakdown in relationships.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.100]   And we all know that because we ourselves have experienced broken relationships with
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.100]   other people.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.180]   There's breakdown in relationship with God.
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.540]   We're taking advantage of creation.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.540]   So there's a lot of brokenness.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.980]   So we could say that our experience actually highlights that the world is broken and that
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.060]   it's damaged by evil.
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.500]   Yes, there is much good.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.500]   There's much to enjoy.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.840]   There's much to celebrate and praise God for that.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.560]   But there's also things where there's just something wrong.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.560]   And we can all sense it.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.960]   And if we take time to think, we can feel the brokenness.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.960]   We can see it.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.960]   We just need to watch the news.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.920]   But we can also just walk around through the city with open eyes and we can all see pain
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.120]   and brokenness all around us.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.880]   And so what happened?
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:10.060]   What brought us from this place of flourishing and thriving to this place where there is
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.180]   breakdown in all these relationships?
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:18.300]   Well, continuing in the book of Genesis 3, we find our answer.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:26.240]   So first, in Genesis 2.16, God commands Adam and Eve not to eat from the tree of the knowledge
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.240]   of good and evil.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.100]   So it's like the one command he gives them.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:35.900]   Actually, he gives them more, but this is one of the commands he gives them.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.980]   And then they are tempted by Satan in the form of serpent.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.380]   And Satan tempts them this way.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.660]   Your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.720]   So they want to be like God.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.800]   They give in to temptation.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.140]   They eat of the fruit of that tree they're not supposed to eat from.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.820]   And there is a bunch of consequences to that, which we know as the fall.
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.340]   Now let me unpack that a little bit.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:09.380]   So we can see that the first thing is when God confronts Adam about what happened is
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.380]   this is what Adam says in Genesis 3.12.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:18.100]   The woman you put here with me, she gave me some of the fruit from the tree and I ate
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.100]   it.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.460]   So Adam, the first thing he does, he blames God, the woman you put here.
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.380]   So he's blaming God, but he's also blaming the woman.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:31.020]   So this is the first act of injustice that we find in scripture, where he's trying to
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:37.900]   self-preserve and so he blames his wife and he blames God.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:44.620]   Now self-preservation is always at the heart of the work of injustice.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.460]   And we seek our advantage at the expense of others.
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.180]   You know, that's when we're selfish.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.460]   When we're a boss, we take advantage of our workers.
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.340]   You know, we preserve ourselves.
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:03.220]   We make the money, but we make other people, we take advantage of them and give them out
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.860]   what is due.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:11.740]   When we do blaming, like we see here, so we do this in all sorts of ways.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.700]   And so self-preservation is at the heart of injustice.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.900]   And what you see is the relationship of all these breakdowns, of all these relationships.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.020]   So can we pull up the slide of damage by evil?
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.020]   This way.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.020]   All right.
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:31.460]   So the relationship, we already talked about Adam and Eve.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.460]   He blames his wife.
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.980]   So now there's a rupture in the relationship between husband and wife.
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.380]   There's a breakdown in relationships.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.340]   So sin breaks down relationship with us and others.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:47.460]   There's a breakdown with relationships and themselves, because we're told that they suddenly
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.100]   realize they're naked and that they feel shame.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.460]   So now suddenly they're carrying shame.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.220]   So there's a breakdown in their relationship with themselves.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.900]   There's a breakdown in their relationship with God.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.300]   You know, God is looking for them and they're hiding.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.260]   Well, you don't hide from someone if everything is okay.
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.820]   Well, they hide because they know what they did is wrong.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.140]   So there's a breakdown between them, their relationship with God.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.220]   And then also as a result of their sin, there's judgment.
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.780]   And there's also a breakdown between them and their relationship with creation.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:28.340]   And so we, again, we can also experience all these different breakdowns where we, where
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.780]   it's brokenness within ourselves, there's brokenness in relationship with others.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.260]   There's brokenness in relationship to creation instead of being stewards and representative
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.020]   of God who contribute to the flourishing of creation.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:44.220]   You know, we exploit it, we destroy it, we consume more than we should.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.100]   And you know, with this, with this creation part, actually what happens is that usually
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:53.300]   the most vulnerable and the weak, the marginalized, they're the ones who are suffering, not the
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.860]   ones who are causing the damage, you know, a lot of the pollution, a lot of exploitation.
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.820]   You know, because they're the ones who deal with extreme weather conditions.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.580]   You know, they're the ones who are dealing with dirty water, don't have access to clean
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.580]   water.
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:10.180]   And so you see there's a breakdown in all these relationships.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:20.300]   And so, so that is the state actually that we find ourselves in, even right now in our
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.300]   world.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.540]   This is still part of our story, that there's brokenness in all these dimensions and relationships
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.460]   of our lives.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.340]   But what does, you know, what does God do about this?
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.860]   And thank God the story doesn't stop there.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:44.620]   God calls Abraham to form a new family, to form a new society, a new community.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.940]   And he wants, he's going to bless Abraham and he's going to bless the descendants, you
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.780]   know, from, bless all nations from the descendants of Abraham.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.020]   That's a promise that God gives.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:04.060]   But he wants his people, this new family to be people who embody, who practice, who learn
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.740]   holiness, righteousness, justice.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:14.420]   He wants them to restore them back to this shalom, to these original, you know, how God
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.420]   created us for.
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:22.100]   He wants his people to carry that and to image that to the world around them.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:29.100]   Now we're basically now summarizing all of the Old Testament with three words, which
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.480]   is very challenging, but I'll give it a shot.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.180]   So basically when you look at the Old Testament, there is three words that deal with justice
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.860]   and injustice and breakdown of relationships.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:47.940]   And we're going to go through them one by one and they summarize what God is trying
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.860]   to do with us as people.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:55.180]   And the first word is the Hebrew word for righteousness.
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.180]   This is a very hard to say, tz'taka.
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.740]   I'm probably saying it wrong.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.020]   And we often think of righteousness, you know, as our own righteousness.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.140]   Jesus made me righteous.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.660]   I'm justified.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.460]   And so I'm okay with God.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.460]   I'm righteous.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.820]   You know, I read the Bible, I pray and there are certain things I don't do.
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.720]   But biblically, the concept of righteousness is actually a lot broader because it involves
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   other people.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.740]   It involves righteousness in relationship to everything.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:29.020]   So Tim Keller, who was a well-known pastor, he says this, tz'taka refers to day-to-day
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:35.980]   living in which a person conducts all relationships and family and society with fairness, generosity
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:36.980]   and equity.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:42.140]   You know, that's the type of righteousness that God wants instilled in his people.
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.940]   That's the type of righteousness that God calls us to, that he wants his image-bearers
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:47.940]   to carry.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:53.460]   And then there's a second concept, which is the word for justice, which is mishpah.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.740]   And there's two, you can differentiate it in two different ways.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:05.100]   There is retributive justice, which means that you, there's a judgment that sort of
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.980]   is meant to set right what was wrong.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.300]   Let's say I steal an apple and then my punishment for stealing the apple when I'm caught is
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.660]   to, you know, replace the apple, maybe pay a little bit interest.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.340]   So that's that type of adjustment.
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:21.060]   But actually scripture most of the time doesn't just talk about that type of justice.
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:28.060]   It talks about restorative justice, which is, goes far beyond, you know, just restoring,
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.780]   you know, what was taken or what was lost.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.340]   And restorative justice is about being concerned about the vulnerable.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.860]   It means advocating for them who are right now not experiencing justice and being generous
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.320]   towards them.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.980]   So that's what it means to be a just person.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.100]   Now, biblically, it's interesting.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:53.340]   A lot of times when we think of advocating for the marginalized, for the poor, for those
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:58.780]   who are suffering and, you know, working for their good, even willing to disadvantage ourselves
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:04.580]   so that others can be brought up, a lot of times you see that as charity.
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:10.780]   But we actually, biblically, that's not an option.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.140]   Because charity is something that's optional, but being a just person and being generous
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.980]   and working this way is who God actually wants us to be.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.840]   So it's meant to be part of us as a person.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.820]   And so that's the second concept.
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.740]   So we have tzedakah and we have mishpah.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.980]   We have righteousness and we have peace.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.780]   But then there's a third one.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:35.060]   And the third one is rashab, which means wickedness.
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.300]   You find that a lot in the Psalms.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.100]   It means to be guilty, to be in the wrong.
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:45.700]   And it describes somebody who mistreats others and disregards the image of God in them.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:52.180]   And so as you read scripture, the Old Testament, these three words, they keep coming up.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:58.420]   How God speaks to Israel, about what he wants them to do, about what he calls them from.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:03.220]   And they're always standing close relationship to each other.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:08.700]   And basically, these three words, they highlight God's desire for his people.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.420]   You know, that he doesn't want them to be wicked, but he wants them to carry the righteousness
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.340]   and justice which reflect his character as they live out their lives.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:23.700]   And there's a constant calling them back from rashab, from wickedness, to being righteous
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.340]   again.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:30.900]   But let's, I don't know about you, when, you know, when I look at issues of injustice,
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.040]   sometimes it can be very overwhelming, right?
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.740]   So especially if you're like an NGO worker, you're working with that, sometimes it's just
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.140]   too much, you know, you feel that way.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:45.460]   And one thing that I think is important is that we remain hope.
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:51.340]   And so we can see how God brings justice to people who are being treated unjustly in scripture.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:56.500]   And the greatest example of that, or I should say the second greatest example of that, is
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:05.580]   the Exodus in the Bible, where God hears the cry of Israel who's being oppressed by Egypt
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:11.340]   and is enslaved to them, and they just keep tightening the screws more and more.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.860]   And so we hear that God hears the cries.
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:19.340]   And so Exodus 7-8 says this, "The Lord said, 'I have indeed seen the misery of the people
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.340]   in Egypt.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:25.740]   I've heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I'm concerned about their
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.180]   suffering.
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:32.540]   So I have come down to rescue them from the land of the Egyptians and to bring them up
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:40.220]   out of the land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey.'"
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.020]   So God has heard a cry, and he's going to do something about it.
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.980]   He doesn't just let it happen.
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:52.300]   And he calls Moses, who himself is a broken person, so God uses broken people nonetheless
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.940]   to bring about his justice.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:59.100]   And he's sent to the Pharaoh, and he confronts Pharaoh and says, "Let my people go."
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:05.060]   And he doesn't, and he does it multiple times, and God demonstrates power through the plagues
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:14.460]   and then ultimately delivers Israel from slavery and starts bringing them to the promised land.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:21.740]   And then along the way, Moses receives the Ten Commandments, where again it talks about
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.700]   the type of people that God wants his people to be, one that love God, that are holy, that
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.740]   are righteous, that are just.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.740]   And so this theme continues.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.820]   But here's a...
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.540]   All of this sounds great, right?
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:42.140]   That God rescues and redeems, but there's a problem, and it's an ongoing problem, because
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:48.100]   a lot of times what happens is when God rescues and redeems people that were oppressed, that
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:56.660]   at some point in time, many of them also become oppressors, where they practice Rashab, where
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.660]   there's wickedness.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:05.100]   I said that the German way, where there's wickedness in their hearts, in their lives.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:11.100]   And what God does throughout Scripture, you see this cycle of injustice.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.420]   He confronts the wickedness of his people.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.420]   And this is interesting, too.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.660]   A lot of times we always think of others as being bad.
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.660]   We always give ourselves credit.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.140]   We're the good guys, they're the bad guys.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.220]   But actually, Scripture-wise, God confronts his people.
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.260]   It's Israel.
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:31.140]   And he confronts his church, Jesus' followers, when there's a lack of righteousness.
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:37.580]   He calls them from wickedness to righteousness, to repent and to restore and to renew them.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.340]   But in the Old Testament, he sends his prophets to call them out.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:46.060]   And it's always with the heart to move them from Rashab, from wickedness, to move them
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.700]   again to righteousness and justice.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:55.140]   But the problem is there is a cycle of injustice, and it seems impossible to break.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:59.660]   Now while God works to bring righteousness and justice, the deep-rooted power of sin
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:05.380]   drives us towards self-preservation and selfish actions that are always at the expense of
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.460]   others, particularly the vulnerable and the weak.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.940]   You know, this is something that we just keep cycling through.
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.700]   We get stuck in our self-preservation.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.700]   We sin against others.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.420]   We put other people down for our own benefit.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:23.100]   And we all, to one degree or another, we participate in that.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:30.460]   So there's a tension in this narrative of Scripture that God calls us to be holy, righteous,
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:37.780]   and just, but that we are not able to do it, and that we cycle through.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.440]   And so we're stuck in this.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.740]   But God loves us so much that he doesn't leave us stuck in sin.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.900]   He doesn't leave us stuck in our wickedness.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:54.080]   He doesn't leave us stuck in our unrighteousness and in our injustices.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:27:02.180]   And so he sends Jesus to come into the mess, into our brokenness, into this world, fully
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:07.420]   God, fully human, to enter into the heart of things.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:14.140]   And this, in the redemptive grand narrative of Scripture, is really the central point
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:22.060]   of that story, that Jesus enters, and through his resurrection and death, he overcomes evil
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:26.020]   and sin, our very issue that we cannot shake.
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:31.660]   And he breaks us free from the power of it, so that we can become people who live different
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:39.420]   lives, who can start imaging him again more fully, who can be righteous, who can be just,
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.740]   who can live in this way, and not out of our own strength, but because of the Holy Spirit
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.900]   that God puts in his people, the laws that he writes on their hearts, so that they can
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:57.200]   live differently, and that they can bring others up.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.940]   So Jesus offers his life now to the guilty and the wicked, which is all of us, because
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.660]   we all, in one way or another, have sinned against God, against other people who are
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:15.420]   made in his image, and through repentance and faith in Jesus, he restores us, he declares
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:21.620]   us as righteous, and he wants us to learn to live as righteous people, and he gives
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:27.780]   us the grace and the power to do so, and so we are restored for life.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.780]   So let's look at that slide, restored for life.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.700]   Here.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.140]   And so the power of sin is broken.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:43.140]   You know, our relationship with God is restored, and the power of sin over us, where we cannot
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.260]   help ourselves to live differently, you know, with ourselves, with others, creation is also
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:53.980]   broken so we can now live differently, because Jesus has won a decisive victory on the cross
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.060]   so we can be different type of people.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.700]   And I want to walk with you through that.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:07.220]   Now often, you know, when we think of the gospel, we just think of God restores relationship
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.340]   between us and ourselves.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:15.020]   And so we get to be here and we get to enjoy this relationship, and it's all about, you
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.220]   know, now we're righteous, now we are in a relationship between us and God, you know,
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:24.060]   now this is restored, and it's all good, you know, I have my ticket to heaven, it's going
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:28.620]   to be amazing, praise Jesus, hallelujah.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.220]   But that's not the full gospel.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.620]   That's not the redemptive grand narrative scripture.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.740]   It is much wider.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:43.220]   The gospel is bigger, more beautiful, because it involves all these facets.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:50.860]   Jesus died so that all of our lives can be restored, all of creation can be restored,
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:56.620]   that once again, shalom can break into this world and be established in all facets of
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.340]   life.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:04.540]   So let's go to the next slide.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:10.540]   So we see here, you know, our relationship with us and God's restored because God sent
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.660]   Jesus to reconcile us, you know, to himself.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.860]   Our relationship with us and ourselves is restored because instead of having the broken
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.980]   identity of being slaves, we are now children of God, we are now part of his family.
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:26.300]   So he restores our identity, who he truly created us to be.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.820]   Now our relationship with others is restored.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.820]   You know, we're brought in the community of brothers and sisters, and we're meant to be
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:39.420]   people who are called to peace, who live in peace with each other, who are people who
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.340]   carry forth the peace, you know, of Christ.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:50.380]   And you know, we're able to do that because we have been forgiven, we can forgive others.
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.740]   But it's not only just between us and others.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.820]   You know, we've been given the ministry of reconciliation, that we can play that role
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.940]   to heal, restore, renew, reconnect other relationships in this creation.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:11.220]   We can address systemic injustices and institutions where we can start reconciling these things,
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:15.580]   you know, back to God, to his purposes, that they're working in this way.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:20.940]   And then also he, through Jesus' death, he also starts restoring our relationship with
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.420]   creation, that we can be the stewards that he has called us to do.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:30.700]   And then one day he will set creation right again and make it whole.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:36.180]   So Jesus died to redeem all four areas of the, you know, the racial context I've been
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.600]   looking at, you know, and that is the whole gospel.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:46.280]   You know, that he will bring newness and wholeness to all of these parts of our lives.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.300]   And that is good news worth believing.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:32:00.700]   Now Jesus, he died a death on the cross that we were already dying to give us a life that
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:06.220]   we could not live on our own.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:11.580]   And he calls the wicked and the guilty to become the righteousness and to live differently,
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:16.640]   to be people of justice, to do the works of Jesus in the world.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.820]   So we come to him in repentance, we ask him for forgiveness, you know, in our breakdown
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:28.840]   relationship with him, with others, with ourselves, with creation, so that we can become the kind
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.460]   of good that we long to see in the world.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.680]   As he gives us this righteousness, that we can start living that out, that we can start
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.380]   being the agent of that.
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.520]   And this is the final part of the redemptive narrative that I want to share with you.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:47.400]   And that is that we together as a church, as a new community, as a people of God are
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.420]   sent to heal into this world.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:57.680]   We're sent together to go out, not just to have enjoy our own relationship with God,
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.920]   but to go out into this world and to start being people who bring healing, who bring
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.880]   restoration, who bring wholeness in areas where there's brokenness, relying on God and
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:12.320]   his power and his grace and the spirits leading to restore, to renew, to heal.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.520]   And we do that by the power of Jesus.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.120]   We don't do that by our own strength.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.400]   And he sends us out to do this together.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:26.720]   And we do that under the leadership of Jesus and by the power of his spirit.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:31.520]   Now it's interesting, the redemptive grant narrative, a lot of times we look at it as
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.320]   if we're standing outside of that story.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.320]   But we're not.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.880]   We're inside the story.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.880]   You are inside a story.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.320]   This is a story of this world.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:51.560]   And we are, we can be passive inside the story, but we're actually meant to be active participants
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:57.440]   in the story to be part of the saving and healing work that God is unfolding, that he
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.880]   wants to unfold through us here in Yuen Long, in Hong Kong and beyond.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:09.040]   Now as I was thinking of Mother Teresa, you know, at the beginning of a sermon, now I
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:17.320]   was just amazed, you know, how she made herself available to create the home for the dying.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.840]   You know, she didn't just see herself as, "Oh, me and my relationship with God is fine.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.840]   You know, I'm good.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.400]   I'm righteous."
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:31.760]   But she believed the full gospel, you know, the whole gospel to live, to be just, because
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:37.040]   part of being a Christian means to be just person and to seek justice for other people.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.960]   And so I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:49.040]   And I just feel that God wants to speak to us.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:54.880]   He wants to challenge us to see ourselves in that story, in this redemptive grand narrative
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:04.800]   of the Bible, where we can be people who bring healing, who bring restoration, who bring
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.640]   the gospel to those around us.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:14.400]   I believe that God wants us to start seeing as we go around.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.120]   He wants us to start seeing things like Mother Teresa saw there was people dying on their
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.720]   own.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.320]   And He will speak to us about those things.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.960]   And He will give us the grace, the wisdom, the strength to do something about those things,
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.760]   to come up with creative solutions.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:39.760]   Remember as image bearers, we can be creative and to bring shalom, to bring healing, to
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.680]   bring restoration into all spheres of society.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.160]   That's what He's inviting us to.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:57.480]   I want to invite everyone to stand.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:03.000]   God is inviting us to see ourselves in the story, the story of His redemption, to be
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.040]   good news people, but not just good news people for ourselves, but good news for all of those
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.880]   around us.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:15.440]   And I just want to invite you right now just to prayerfully to respond to God.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.920]   If you want to say, "I want to see, Lord, open my eyes.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.960]   I want to participate in your work."
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:26.520]   I believe, Holy Spirit, that you will show us what to do, that you will help us to figure
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:33.040]   out together how we can contribute to your justice, to your mercy in our community, how
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:40.560]   we can do your work and see healing, see salvation of people happening.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:48.280]   And I just want to encourage you to just say, "Jesus, I'm in.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.760]   I want to be part of what you're doing."
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.400]   And if that's you, I just want to encourage you just as a sign of availability to stretch
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:00.480]   out your hands before you, to say, "Maybe you don't know what this looks like, but it's
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.000]   like, Holy Spirit, I'm just open."
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.800]   I want to encourage you to stretch out your hands before you, and I just would love to
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.120]   pray over us as a church.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:20.760]   Jesus, I thank you so much that you invite us to be partakers of your redemptive story,
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:26.240]   that you have a purpose for us here in Yuen Long, to bring healing, to bring restoration,
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:32.080]   to bring wholeness, to bring love, to bring care, to bring mercy, to bring justice to
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.800]   those around us.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.840]   I pray that you would reveal things to us, that we would see things, and where you just
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:46.080]   stir within our spirit to know that you wanted us to do something about that, that we're
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:50.620]   the ones who are able to, that you will lead us in that, Lord.
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.620]   And this is your work.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.880]   This is not because we come up with it, but it's your spirit moving among your people.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.200]   And this is us saying, "Yes, we want to be the people that you have set us free for.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.440]   We want to be your righteous and your just people, so will you use us?"
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.240]   We pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.800]   Amen.
