1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Amen. Thank you, Joshua. Hey, let's give Joshua a big hand.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,800
 First time service leading. Well done.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,240
 When I was actually, can we pull up the football slide? I do want to talk about that a little bit.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:28,480
 Sorry. It was too exciting. Okay. So here you see the easy. You see the viney long team.

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:37,040
 We had an incredible football tournament this past Friday. I want to say thank you for those

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,080
 of you who came out to support us. Also, thank you for those who helped us raise funds for

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,920
 Branches of Hope. So we're able to reach 7,000 Hong Kong dollars for Branches of Hope. So we're

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,760
 excited about that. And then to our own surprise, we actually did quite well. So we won the first

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:03,280
 three games. We made it into the playoffs and we ended up losing in the quarter final and the

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,680
 penalty shootouts. And it was very dramatic. That's how we liked it. So it was good. So thank

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,680
 you so much. But yeah, thanks for pulling that up. But today it's a one-off message. Next week,

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,440
 we'll also have a one-off message. And I just want to share something that was in my heart for you.

13
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,400
 Now, when I was a university or just a young graduate, I just graduated from university.

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,480
 And it seemed like that the people around me, that things were coming together in their lives,

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,720
 that stuff was working out for them, that their careers were working out,

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,320
 their relationships were working out. And here there was me. And I was still trying to find my

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:56,640
 way, my career path. I was wondering, is there somebody that there's a significant other that

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,080
 I'm going to be able to get to spend my life with? And during that time, a lot of my friends got

19
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,200
 married and the US people marry young. They had very promising jobs. And so as I was doing this

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:19,600
 comparison thing, I just really was wondering, am I ever going to be content because I was feeling

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:26,400
 some discontent in my heart? Am I going to be okay? Am I going to make it? And there was some anxiety

22
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:36,160
 actually around my future. Now, I think we all have experienced this, where we long to experience

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,360
 content in our heart, where we just feel at peace with where we are and what's happening.

24
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:52,160
 But the reality is that's actually not easy to come by, is it? To feel content.

25
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,680
 That's something I feel like it's like, you know, you almost have it and then it slips through your

26
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,400
 hands. Or feeling content is just something that seems like I'm almost there. It's just around the

27
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,640
 corner. If just this one thing happens, then I'm going to feel content. My life is going to be

28
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,720
 amazing. You know, everything's going to be good. But it always just seems a little bit out of reach

29
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,680
 for most of us. And then there are seasons where we do feel content and then our circumstances change

30
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,320
 and all of that goes out the window. And what do we do then?

31
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,720
 How should we think about this? Well, what I want to explore with you today through this message

32
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,360
 and this word that God has put on my heart is I want to explore with you this question.

33
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,320
 How can I grow and learn to be content in all circumstances?

34
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,080
 And is that even something that is possible? Or is that just wishful thinking?

35
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,320
 Does that sound good? Yes. A little bit. Yes. Okay. Good. Good. Just making sure.

36
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,360
 You know, it's not two people are excited about this. There's a few more. That's good.

37
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,800
 So what we're going to do is we're going to go to the book of Philippians, which is one of the

38
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,360
 letters that Paul wrote. And in Philippians, one of the reasons why he wrote the letter,

39
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,000
 actually, it was like I was reading one of those introductory New Testament books. There's seven

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,960
 reasons for why Paul wrote the letter of Philippians. But I want to share with you one

41
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,560
 that is significant for our context for what we're going to look at. And that is Paul is writing this

42
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:46,000
 letter to say thank you for a financial gift that the Philippians have made to him while he is in

43
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,160
 prison in Rome. So Paul is writing this letter from prison in Rome and he's saying thank you.

44
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,400
 Now, what makes this more significant is that Paul and the Philippians, they have a very close

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,000
 relationship. He planted the church in Philippi. They have been supporting him. They've been

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,560
 partners with him in ministry and have supported him financially all along. But another thing is

47
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:22,400
 that they didn't give out of their abundance. Actually, in second Corinthians, we learned that

48
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:30,560
 the Philippians were facing severe trials and that they were living in extreme poverty. So their

49
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,480
 generosity flows out of a place of extreme poverty. That's out of the place that they're giving and

50
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:46,480
 loving on Paul in his circumstances. And so Paul is saying thank you. And so this is where we pick

51
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:55,360
 up in Philippians 4, starting in verse 10, it says this. "I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last

52
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,080
 you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.

53
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,960
 I'm not saying this because I'm in need, for I've learned to be content whatever the circumstances.

54
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,160
 I know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have plenty. I've learned the secret

55
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:25,360
 of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in

56
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:35,360
 plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Now in verse 10, we see

57
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,280
 that Paul, he rejoices that this concern for him has been renewed. And he also acknowledges that

58
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,520
 for whatever reason, for a season, didn't have the opportunity to express their loving concern

59
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,400
 for Paul. Now maybe it was their own difficult circumstances. Maybe it was even Paul's

60
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,160
 circumstances. Because I mean, he's in prison, Philippi and Rome, they're like 800 kilometers

61
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,160
 or something like that apart. Back then there was no text messaging. So it's hard to keep up with

62
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,240
 what's going on in each other's lives. But at last they have renewed their concern and Paul is just

63
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,360
 grateful and he says, "Thank you." But then he turns things around and he wants to actually

64
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,000
 encourage them through his own example. And so that's what verse 11 and 13 is all about. And

65
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,600
 this is what I want to focus on with us, is how Paul wants to encourage the Philippians who are

66
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,880
 facing struggles, who are facing challenges, and he wants to speak into their lives. Now,

67
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,520
 as I was praying over what to share, I had a million thoughts, a million ideas,

68
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,800
 but I just felt that we're one year into our church plan or the public launch, at least,

69
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,880
 we've been doing this longer. There's a lot of things, I know there's a lot of things going on

70
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:03,440
 in your lives. And I just felt that God wants to encourage us and give us confidence in who he is

71
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:13,840
 so that we can learn to be content and know him, know his power in all circumstances of our lives.

72
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,560
 So that was my sense for the day and so that's what I want to share with you.

73
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:29,120
 So let me take you to verse 11 and 12. It says, "I'm not saying this because I'm in need.

74
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,280
 For I've learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need

75
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,560
 and I know what it is to have plenty. I've learned the secret of being content in any

76
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,120
 and every situation, whether well-fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want."

77
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:53,600
 So Paul is saying, "Hey, I'm grateful for your gift. Thank you so much."

78
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:03,040
 But then he says, and this is super interesting, "But your gift is not what guarantees me being

79
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,480
 content. My external circumstances, they don't determine whether or not I feel content."

80
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,680
 Now this is actually mind-blowing, right? He's in prison. Now in prison back in the days,

81
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,440
 it wasn't that the government was collecting money and then uses money to feed prisoners.

82
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,600
 Prisoners depended on family members and friends to actually bring

83
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,880
 needed resources to the prison. If you had nobody bringing you anything, that was it.

84
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:41,520
 And so, but Paul is saying, "My well-being does not depend on gifts like this. It depends

85
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:50,560
 on something else." And he also, he was not somebody who was living this luxurious life

86
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,520
 where everything was working out perfectly. He didn't have any challenges. I mean, he's in prison.

87
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:04,080
 He was, had people, churches that he loved turn on him. We saw him as his enemies. He was beaten

88
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:11,120
 several times, almost to death. So, I mean, this guy, for him to say that is very significant.

89
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,840
 These are not just like easily spoken words from somebody who's like comfortable sitting

90
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:26,080
 somewhere on a nice sofa, having a drink. Now, let's continue to, actually, before I go any

91
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,840
 further, let me define what we mean by content. And I want to give a Christian definition of this.

92
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,840
 And so here's a definition, says this, "Contentment describes finding peace,

93
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,440
 joy, and satisfaction regardless of life circumstances."

94
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,240
 So, Paul is making this incredible claim that regardless of what happens outside of him,

95
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:58,240
 he can know the joy, the satisfaction, and the contentment in the Lord, the peace

96
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,440
 that surpasses all understanding. This is absolutely incredible. But of course,

97
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,720
 we wonder, is this really true? You know, is this something that we can actually really

98
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,120
 experience and know? So, let's continue to unpack this. So, in verse 12, Paul says,

99
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,480
 "I have learned the secret of being content." Now, this is very interesting. It has the word

100
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,440
 "learned" and it has the word "secret." Now, why would Paul use these two words?

101
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,320
 That he learned and it's a secret? Well, I believe that it points us towards this learning to be

102
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,520
 content or being content is not something that is just easily come by. There has been some lessons,

103
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:52,080
 life lessons along the way that have brought Paul to this point. But you also use the word "secret"

104
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,160
 because it's not everyone knows how to experience this contentment. Just like

105
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,440
 books. I actually did some Amazon search about some book titles that uses the word "the secret."

106
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:11,360
 So, the secret of lasting beauty. You know, oh, I want to know that. I'm getting older, you know.

107
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:20,880
 The secret of a successful marriage. That's a good one. The secret of winning at life.

108
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:31,280
 Why do these books exist? Because we're looking for the code, right? We want to find the answer

109
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:37,600
 to these questions or something that's just not easily available. We want to know the answer

110
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,520
 because we want to experience the good marriage, the lasting beauty, the good life. And so,

111
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,120
 we buy these books, attend these workshops, you know, do all these things. But Paul is using

112
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:59,520
 this to just say this experience of contentment, you know, it's not something that is easily come

113
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:07,280
 by and actually eludes or is not easily available or obvious to everyone how to experience that.

114
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,680
 And people actually really struggle with that. Now, I want to be clear, he's not saying actually

115
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,880
 through his passage, he tells us how we can learn to be content or how we find contentment. So,

116
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,840
 he's actually, it's an open secret in what he's writing. But he's using this language to show us,

117
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:31,040
 you know, that it's actually something that doesn't come easy our way. So, the first thing is that

118
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,160
 real contentment is a secret. But just because it's hard for us to be content, it does not stop

119
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:46,320
 us from trying, does it? We often believe that the desire for contentment will be satisfied by

120
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:55,120
 accomplishments, material possessions, relationships, and the approval of others.

121
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:03,120
 We say to ourselves, "Hey, you say it's a secret. Hey, I know the secret. I know the answer to what

122
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,080
 will make me content. If only I have this relationship, if only I get married, if only I have

123
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,400
 this house, if only I can stay in this job a little bit longer and I get that promotion,

124
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,080
 if only I get the approval from my father that I've been working so hard for."

125
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,480
 And I just wonder, I'm just thinking about ourselves,

126
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,360
 what have you been telling yourself that will give you contentment? You know, what are you thinking

127
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:43,840
 in these material things or other achievements that will provide contentment for you?

128
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,320
 You know, is it that relationship?

129
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,480
 Is it that promotion? Is it a designer bag?

130
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,480
 Is it a designer bag? Something that I don't care about at all? You know, what is it?

131
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:16,320
 And so we say to ourselves, "I know what will make me happy. I know what will make me content.

132
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:25,280
 I know what I'm after. That thing, this will bring me contentment." And we believe that the objects

133
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,680
 that are stirring the desire within us will also be the objects that will bring the contentment.

134
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:39,520
 Let me give you an example. When I was younger, living in Germany, Nike or Nike, you know,

135
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,320
 some people call it Nike, some call it Nike, shoes were expensive. And they were really something

136
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,000
 special. Not everyone had those, but some of my friends had them. They played basketball.

137
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,640
 And I really wanted a pair of Nikes, some Nike shoes. And I thought if I have them,

138
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,520
 you know, it's going to feel great. I'm going to be a better basketball player.

139
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,440
 And I'm going to be a little bit cooler. And so there was the object that stirred this desire

140
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:15,120
 in my heart. And I thought that somehow these shoes will make me feel better. And they did.

141
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,880
 But just for a little while, right? Just for a little while. And then I thought,

142
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,080
 "Oh, it's not the shoes. It's this other thing." And so the question is, you know,

143
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,040
 is that really true about these things that we say will bring us contentment?

144
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,080
 Is it really true? The things that you're looking for,

145
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:44,800
 that you think will make you all right, are those really the things that make us all right?

146
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,160
 Now, I did get those shoes. I think some of us have reached some of our goals, achieved perhaps

147
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,040
 some of our dreams along the way. And it does feel good. There's no denying of that.

148
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,800
 But then what happens is we reach this goal and then we turn around and we say, "You know what?

149
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,240
 It wasn't this thing, but it's this other thing that will make me content."

150
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,840
 And then we focus our energy on this other thing that we don't have yet.

151
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:23,760
 So being content is like, you know, I'm trying to reach for this thing,

152
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:32,320
 but I struggle to ever really arrive. I'm just not getting there. It's just always around the corner.

153
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,840
 It slips through my hands.

154
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,400
 But yet, you know, I'm feeling this longing to just be whole, to be at peace

155
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,120
 about all the things that are going on in my life.

156
00:17:49,120 --> 00:18:00,400
 And so we seek to find contentment in things. Now, in verse 12, Paul shows us what true

157
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,480
 contentment looks like. It means being content in all of life's circumstances. There's a true

158
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,720
 contentment and there's a false contentment. True contentment means, you know, whatever happens,

159
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,200
 it doesn't matter. I can know peace. I can know joy. I can know satisfaction,

160
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:27,760
 regardless of what happens. But a false contentment is exposed, and Paul talks about plenty and want.

161
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:35,520
 When we experience plenty and want, that sort of shows if there's a lot of things that we can do,

162
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,520
 sort of shows of the contentment that we're experiencing if it's the real deal.

163
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,920
 Or if something happens and whatever circumstances are changed, you know,

164
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:51,840
 are we really going to be content? So the way you can tell you have real contentment is if you can

165
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,720
 handle plenty and want. But there is actually a problem with that. Because a lot of times,

166
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,800
 well, some of us never experience want. Like we've always in our lives actually had

167
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:15,360
 a certain level of things and cares. We never hit really the point where we're just struggling for

168
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:23,040
 existence. But some of us have experienced that. You know, we know want. And we've just hit rock,

169
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:30,080
 you know, bottom or we're in a very difficult place. But I believe that most of us have not

170
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:37,520
 experienced plenty. Where really in a very major substantial way, our dreams come actually true.

171
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:46,320
 Where we get the influence, the power, the finances, the whatever it is that you dream of,

172
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,520
 that you just have that in such a crazy abundance. That you actually find out,

173
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:01,360
 even if I have all these things, they still don't make me content. Now, Jim Carrey, some of you know

174
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:08,480
 him. It's by now it's a little bit maybe for older generation already. So he was or is a Canadian

175
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,760
 actor, comedian. Back in the 90s, 2000s was movies. I don't know if he still does movies or not.

176
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,760
 But he said this, so somebody who has reached plenty, he says this,

177
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,480
 I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of,

178
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:32,800
 so they can see that it's not the answer. You know, even if you reach this point,

179
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:41,440
 it's actually does not make you content. But most of us never get there. And so the problem is we

180
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,320
 maybe we taste a little bit of it. And so we actually still believe that those things will

181
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,880
 make us content. You know, because we just experienced a little bit of the dream.

182
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,080
 And like if I just managed to do a little bit more, you know, then I'm going to be content.

183
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:08,720
 And so we actually buy into this lie. But what if we actually do experience plenty and want?

184
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,280
 You know, what are what are some of the responses? Well, there's three. I want to suggest three ways

185
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,840
 that people respond to it. The first one is they reach their dream. It is fulfilled. It's amazing.

186
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,520
 But then after a little while, it wears off. And they're like, you know what? Actually,

187
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,480
 this was not my dream. This thing here is my dream. You know, that that relationship

188
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,960
 that didn't make me happy. This other relationship is going to really make me happy.

189
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,320
 And so then they shifted like, oh, I was wrong about this, but I know I'm right about this.

190
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:46,320
 So that's one response. Another one is that actually grow cynical. Like where we, you know,

191
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,280
 you reach this, you know, your dream and you're like, you know, I've tried so hard to be content.

192
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:01,040
 But I'm. I feel like the universe is messing with me because I even if I have all these things,

193
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,320
 I just don't feel good. I think this this world is just a joke. And so this is actually a very

194
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,200
 dark place to be in, right? A very cynical place. So that's that's a conclusion that people draw.

195
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,640
 But then there is a third thing. And that's, of course, what I want to suggest to you

196
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,760
 is that actually this this longing for being content and looking for it and things

197
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,920
 that it actually is something that points us towards God.

198
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,400
 You know that that there is something in this universe that can fulfill these deep longings

199
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,840
 and that we can find that in a personal relationship with Jesus.

200
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:53,600
 And so this is actually a story of C.S. Lewis. C.S. Lewis, he was an English professor at Oxford

201
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:03,120
 and Cambridge University. He writes about his journey of coming to faith in the book Surprised

202
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,280
 by Joy. And it's actually his longing. He calls it Zanzig, which is German, which makes me happy.

203
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:16,640
 You know, this longing that he felt was actually what brought him on his journey of of finding faith.

204
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,240
 That there must be something else. And so he wrote and mere Christianity,

205
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,800
 one of his most well-known books. He wrote this quote. So he's talking about that because we have

206
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,840
 this longing, it is something that points us to God. Let me read this to you. Creatures are not

207
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,800
 born with desires unless satisfaction for this desire exists. A baby feels hunger. Well, there's

208
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:48,560
 such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim. Where is such a thing as water? Men feel sexual

209
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:59,760
 desire. What is such a thing as sex? If I find myself. If in if I find in myself a desire which

210
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:07,920
 no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another

211
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:16,000
 world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud.

212
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,520
 So in other words, it does not prove the cynical view. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant

213
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:29,760
 to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. So in other words, our longing

214
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,160
 and desire for being content, they point us to God. You know, that there is someone out there

215
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,800
 who can fulfill this deep longing and desire in our hearts and who can meet that, that it doesn't

216
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:49,520
 matter what the circumstances are. We can find wholeness. We can find peace. We can find strength.

217
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,320
 We can find joy. We can find satisfaction, you know, in him. And this is actually also where

218
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:07,040
 Paul is moving in the letter to Philippians in verse 13. So he says this. He says, I can do all

219
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:16,720
 of this through him who gives me strength. So out of this relationship with Jesus, he can face plenty

220
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:24,160
 and want because it's Jesus who gives him the power and the strength to cope with whatever comes his way.

221
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:31,680
 Now this is not denying that there are real challenges. This is not a spirituality where we

222
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:38,160
 need to, oh, you know, everything's great. And it's not, but, but Paul is just saying, you know, he can

223
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:47,920
 face those things by the power of Jesus and he can know peace. He can know joy in the midst of all of that.

224
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:56,480
 And so in contrast to like self-sufficiency or self-reliance, Paul says, I am strong enough

225
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:03,520
 because of Jesus who is my strength and I can face this. I can get through this.

226
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,960
 And so part of my heart for us today is actually, I believe that Jesus wants to give us confidence

227
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,040
 in him because sometimes we lose confidence in Jesus, even as Christians. And we kind of try

228
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,200
 to hedge our bets and like, maybe, maybe this other thing is actually what does really satisfy me.

229
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,720
 And that Jesus wants to give us confidence and know it is him and him that we find our satisfaction.

230
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:37,360
 It is he who will give us the grace and the strength to be at peace in very difficult situations

231
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:45,760
 and experience, you know, his love and to even have joy that the Holy Spirit gives, you know, in

232
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,160
 those circumstances, even if it doesn't make any sense to people around us. It's like just a little

233
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,960
 bit earlier in the chapter, Paul talks about that we can come to Jesus and he gives us a peace

234
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,800
 that surpasses all understanding, the peace of God that he bestows that on his people.

235
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:15,600
 And so God wants to release his confidence in Jesus that we can face whatever it is that we're

236
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,360
 facing, whatever it is that we're going through, that he can be our strength. I can do all of this

237
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,640
 through him who gives me strength. So we all can say that and we all not just say it, but actually

238
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:37,120
 can know that I can do all things, all of this through him who gives me strength. Now, it's

239
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:45,040
 interesting that Paul, he talks about also that he learned to be content. He actually repeats that

240
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:52,160
 multiple times in the passage. And so there is a thing of like that this doesn't just fall in our

241
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:59,360
 laps, but it is actually as we live life, as we face these challenges and as we struggle with

242
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,360
 and learn to trust Jesus with what's going on, as we do that, we experience that he meets us

243
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:16,880
 in that struggle. And he does it every time because he is faithful every time. But we struggle

244
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,400
 and that's the truth, right? Like we struggle to actually trust them. We often, we don't come to

245
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:29,280
 him. We try to deal with what's going on in different ways. But Paul over his lifespan,

246
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,960
 you know, he learned to continuously come to Jesus. This can be on our own. This can also be

247
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,800
 with others that pray with us, that help us, you know, and where we entrust what's going on.

248
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:49,920
 And when we find rest, that God is sovereign over our circumstances, that he is Lord and he is with

249
00:28:49,920 --> 00:29:00,160
 us and he will see us through whatever it is that we're facing. And then suddenly the peace of God,

250
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:07,760
 you know, falls on us and we get to experience that even in the most difficult and challenging

251
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,680
 circumstances. Now, a little bit later in the letter, Paul, he continues to encourage the

252
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:22,640
 Philippians and he says this in Philippians 4 verse 19. He says, "And my God will meet all your

253
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:31,840
 needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus." And I love this. He's like, "My God,

254
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:41,440
 my God can do that for you." He's speaking from personal experience because he experienced it

255
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,600
 for himself. So he knows that because God has done this for him, he can also do it for you.

256
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:56,240
 My God can meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.

257
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:06,160
 Wow, that's amazing. So Paul is saying we can learn to be content as we walk with Jesus,

258
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:12,720
 as we continuously place our trust in Jesus, you know, and as we experience him meeting us

259
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,760
 and in these circumstances, and he wants to build our confidence. He wants us to know that he is

260
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,960
 faithful. We're unfaithful. We struggle, but he is faithful and he is with you and he will walk

261
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:32,240
 with you through whatever it is that you're going on and he will give you peace. He can release joy

262
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,600
 and even satisfaction when it doesn't make sense that your contentment does not depend

263
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:55,760
 on external circumstances. Does that sound good? Yeah. And I, you know, in my own life,

264
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,360
 I've shared some struggles here before and so I'm also not somebody who easily just preaches

265
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,640
 this who has never experienced anything difficult or challenging in his life.

266
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,240
 You know, I've experienced when I hit my own rock bottom, when the rug was pulled from underneath my

267
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,600
 feet in my job, a relationship, my home, you know, all of this was gone.

268
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,960
 Now I wrestled. I wasn't right away content.

269
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,320
 And I've experienced it was like I prayed once and then, oh, no, I'm content. Okay, it's all good.

270
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,400
 You know, but it was a wrestling and we're talking about months.

271
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:44,240
 But Jesus met me and he gave me confidence that it is he who sees us through whatever struggle,

272
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:52,080
 whatever difficulty you're experiencing. And if my God can do it for me, he can also do it for you.

273
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,680
 Amen.

274
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:01,280
 So I want to invite the worship team to come up.

275
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,720
 You know, it's a, as I've been sharing, it is in this personal relationship with Jesus

276
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,800
 that we find true contentment.

277
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:19,760
 You know, that's where we find peace. That's where we find rest for our souls.

278
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:27,200
 And we find peace in the presence of God.

279
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,960
 And I know it's easy to, you know, to come to church and I don't know everyone's backgrounds.

280
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,080
 You know, some of you, maybe you're a Christian, some of you maybe are not.

281
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:45,040
 But as one of the responses we'll have, I'll give different ways of responding to this message.

282
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,840
 One of them, I just simply want to ask, you know, is there anyone here

283
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,880
 that wants to invite Jesus into their lives?

284
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,240
 You know, that says like, "Hey, I've experienced

285
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:06,880
 this discontent and I just want to experience it's Jesus who meets people in their challenges."

286
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,600
 And, you know, if that's you, if you want to invite Jesus in your life,

287
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,840
 in just a moment I'm going to give an opportunity to, but actually want to ask,

288
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,320
 can we turn down the lights a little bit and can we actually close our eyes, if that's okay?

289
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:33,520
 So I want to ask if there's anyone, maybe for a while you've been thinking about this,

290
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:40,160
 taking the step of faith. I want to ask if there's anyone who wants to take this step.

291
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,760
 And if you do, I want to ask you to maybe just give me a little wave.

292
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,360
 Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say a prayer.

293
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,400
 I'm going to say a phrase, you know, by phrase and give you space where you can follow it.

294
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,440
 And it's through this prayer that we say, "Jesus, come into my life. I want to be a Christian."

295
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,960
 And you can make this your own prayers. I'm going to pray a line and then you can repeat

296
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,080
 and I'll pray another line and then you can repeat. And so why don't we do this now?

297
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,920
 Jesus, I'm sorry that I have sinned against you and I've sinned against other people.

298
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:39,120
 Jesus, thank you that you died for my sins on the cross, that you forgive me.

299
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,560
 I place my trust in you.

300
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,960
 Will you come into my life?

301
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,240
 Will you fill me with your Holy Spirit?

302
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,680
 And will you show me what it means to know you

303
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,160
 and what it means to live my life for you?

304
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,760
 Amen.

305
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:16,160
 Now, if you've prayed this prayer, God's word says if we confess with our tongue that Jesus

306
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:24,640
 Christ is Lord, you know, we are saved. And I would love to help you and, you know, take further

307
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,480
 steps or afterwards I'll be up front here. You can come and we'd just like to guide you more so you

308
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,600
 know, you know, how to move forward in this journey. But right now, what I want to do is,

309
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,240
 as I shared, even as Jesus followers, even as Christians, you know, we struggle with discontent

310
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,920
 and a lot of times our hearts, you know, we get unsure. Can Jesus really help? And so we place

311
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,480
 our trust in other things, in idols, you know, that we think this thing will make me happy.

312
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,080
 That's an idol. Whatever you think will make you fulfilled and content besides God, you know,

313
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:06,160
 that's an idol. And I want to actually just create a space for us to turn to each other.

314
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,920
 Maybe somebody you came with, maybe somebody sitting next to you, you ask them if they're

315
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:21,040
 open to praying with you and just pray that God will meet you, you know, in this area of discontent,

316
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,360
 that he will give you confidence in him, that he is powerful, that he's able to see you through

317
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:33,440
 whatever it is that's going on. And so I want to just give space for five minutes or so to pray

318
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,280
 with each other. It's also okay if you want to just pray on you and you can say, tell the person

319
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,280
 here, I just want to pray on my own. That's okay. But why don't we do that right now as a church?

320
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,560
 And we'll just take time to pray with each other. So turn to each other. Let's pray for one another.

321
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,960
 Let's pray that God meets us in the areas we're struggling to trust him, struggling to be confident

322
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,080
 in him and just ask him to meet us. So let's do this right now. And then in about five minutes

323
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:04,080
 or so, I'll come back and I'll pray for us. Jesus, you've heard the cry of our hearts.

324
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:15,600
 Will you instill faith and trust in you and our hearts? Will you release faith on your people?

325
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:22,400
 Will you give us confidence in you? Will you meet us in the places where

326
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,680
 there's right now pain, there's difficulty, and we're just overwhelmed?

327
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,960
 Will you give us confidence? Will you help us see that you are sovereign over the situation,

328
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:43,760
 that you stand above it, that you are with us, that we are not alone, that all power belongs to you,

329
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,640
 that you love us and you do not withhold your goodness from us and you will meet us

330
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,680
 in those places of need. Strengthen your people, strengthen our hearts,

331
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:04,000
 and allow us to be content in whatever comes our way because you are with us.

332
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,440
 Because we know you. So I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.
