1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 Have a seat, have a seat, have a seat. It is so good to have you guys with us here today. If it's

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,200
 your first time to The Vine, my name is Andrew. I'm one of the pastors here, and we are so glad

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,920
 that you're present with us. And we are absolutely jam-packed today in the overflow as well. Welcome

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,600
 to everybody in the overflow. We're so glad that you're with us. As well as everybody that's joining

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,600
 us online, streaming from around the world, we're so glad that you're with us as well.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,840
 We come today to the actual turning point of the whole of the Exodus story. In fact, the event that

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,560
 we're looking at today is not just a turning point in the Exodus story, but it is probably the

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,840
 central narrative in the whole of our scriptures. It's certainly the central narrative that has

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:52,560
 shaped and formed both the Jewish faith, but also the Christian faith ever since. It's a central

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:02,800
 act of God where the axis of his redemptive love for humanity actually pivots. And a moment

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:11,360
 where we see both the power and judgment of God, and yet also his mercy and his grace come together.

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:20,160
 Pharaoh, after nine plagues that have slowly built up to bring a condemnation against the

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,720
 pantheon of Egyptian gods and the idolatry that it has created in its people,

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,160
 Pharaoh is about to discover the brutal consequences of his hardened heart.

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:40,160
 For God is about to act in Egypt like God has never acted before. And when he does,

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:50,560
 finally, Israel's long walk to freedom is about to begin. This is our 14th week of Exodus,

17
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,920
 but we've only just got to the start of the Exodus. Are you with me?

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:06,160
 The 10th plague that we're looking at today is the plague of the death of every firstborn in

19
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:15,760
 Egypt, every firstborn son. It's a plague of staggering contrasts, because on the one side,

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,960
 it does show this reality of God's justice and his holiness. But on the other side, it challenges us

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,040
 with deep poignancy. It's the kind of plague that you can't stand back from and just read in the

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,800
 Scriptures and think, "Oh, that's nice." It's a plague that grabs you visually, passionately,

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,320
 and speaks of things that's difficult for us to reconcile with a peaceful and loving God.

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:52,240
 But just like we saw last week, where we need the appropriate lens through which to view the

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,480
 plagues themselves, so when it comes to the 10th plague, we need to have the right lens to approach

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,280
 and to understand it. Like last week, where we saw that there was an actual beginning to the

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,080
 plague narrative that the storyteller wanted you to look through. So here in the 10th plague,

28
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,960
 there is also a lens through which God wants us to look through as we look at both the brutality

29
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:22,400
 and the poignancy of this 10th plague. And to show you that beginning, the actual Exodus story

30
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,760
 of the 10th plague, the plague of the firstborns, is found in Exodus chapters 11 and 12. But the

31
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,840
 lens through which God wants you to see it is actually found in Exodus chapter 4. Actually,

32
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,840
 in a moment where Moses has just met with God at the burning bush. And off the back of that burning

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,040
 bush moment, Moses is having a conversation with God about how Moses and them feel capable of being

34
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,000
 able to go back to Egypt. He's still in the wilderness at this point. He's not gone back to

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,160
 Egypt. He's never spoken to Pharaoh. But God speaks these words to him in that moment. This

36
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:03,120
 is Exodus chapter 4, starting in verse 21. "The Lord said to Moses, 'When you return to Egypt,

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,960
 which you're going to do in just a little while, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders

38
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,480
 that I've given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the

39
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:26,000
 people go.' Then say to Pharaoh this, 'This is what the Lord says, 'Israel is my firstborn son.

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,960
 And I told you, 'Let my son go so he may worship me.' But you refuse to let him go,

41
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,080
 so I will kill your firstborn son.'" I want you to get into your head what's happening here.

42
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,600
 Before Moses has gone back to the land of Egypt and confronted Pharaoh for that first time that

43
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,080
 we see in chapter 5, here whilst he's still in the wilderness, God begins to unpack for him what's

44
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,280
 going to happen in the place. And he begins to say, "Look, I see you as my firstborn son." Here's

45
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,720
 the powerful thing. This is the first time in all our scriptures where God refers to his people as

46
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,320
 his children. This becomes a major metaphor in the rest of the Christian narrative. The rest of the

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,960
 Old Testament and the New Testament speaks about God's love for his children, God's love for his

48
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,120
 sons and daughters. All of that starts here. This is the very first mention in the whole of

49
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,760
 scripture where God identifies himself as a father over Israel, as a father over his people. And he

50
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:32,080
 says to them, "Don't you realize that Israel is my firstborn son?" We know in Chinese culture

51
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,640
 the importance of firstborn sons. Can I have an amen? I know that was a very quiet amen.

52
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,520
 Raise your hand if you're a firstborn son in the room. Come on, put them up proudly. All right.

53
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,480
 Some women raised their hands. That's a little worrying, but we'll come back to that later.

54
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,600
 But we know in the culture here that firstborn sons is important, isn't it? And it was no

55
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,920
 different in ancient Near Eastern culture. Because back there, if you were a firstborn son,

56
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,640
 it came with privilege. It came with prestige, and it came with power. You were going to be

57
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,080
 the one that would carry on the generations of your family name. You were the one that actually

58
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,240
 held all of that prestige in front of the world. The rest of the family looked to you to provide.

59
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,960
 The rest of the family looked to you to be the one who would carry forth the integrity and the

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,880
 honesty and the value of your name. The firstborn son had a big job to do. And God says, "These

61
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,400
 people are like my firstborn son. They're the ones that are going to carry forward my name into the

62
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,360
 generations that are to come. They're the ones that have the value and the integrity and the

63
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,760
 honor to show the world my character and my name because my firstborn son represents who I am."

64
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,040
 Do you follow that? So it's important. But I want you to see this. He then speaks to Pharaoh,

65
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,200
 and he says, "You have a firstborn son too. And I'm going to do something to your firstborn son.

66
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:00,880
 That firstborn son is going to be killed." And when we read it like this, we think,

67
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:12,800
 "How can God do that? How can God allow that to happen?" Well, this tension between the firstborn

68
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,520
 son of Israel and the firstborn son of Pharaoh's family is the lens through which God wants you

69
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,480
 to look at as you now come to the 10th plague itself, which is found, as I said earlier,

70
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,840
 in chapters 11 and 12. Now, there's a lot of scripture here. I'm not going to go through it.

71
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,960
 I just want to pull out a couple of key verses for you to really understand God's message in the

72
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,400
 10th plague. The first is found actually in Exodus chapter 11. I'm going to start in verse 1. It says

73
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,720
 this, "Now the Lord God said to Moses, 'I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt.

74
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,920
 After that, he will let you go from here. And when he does, he will drive you out completely.'"

75
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,520
 Can I get an amen? Finally, it's going to work. Finally, this plague is going to have the work

76
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,080
 that God has longed to want to do. Finally, Israel is going to be released from their slavery.

77
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,200
 Starting from next week in our Exodus series, we're going to be talking about a free Israel,

78
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,320
 no longer bound in slavery to the ways that they've been treated for 430 years in Egypt.

79
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,800
 Now, because of this event, God's people are going to be set free. Verse 4 says this, "So Moses said,

80
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,480
 'This is what the Lord says. About midnight, I will go throughout Egypt. Every firstborn son

81
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,600
 in Egypt will die. From the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn

82
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,200
 son of the slave girl, who's at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of all the cattle as well.

83
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,800
 There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt. Worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.'"

84
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,600
 I want you to see something really important here. Because often when we think of the 10th plague,

85
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,160
 and we hear about the killing of the firstborn sons, we immediately think that this is God's

86
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,280
 polemic against Egypt and Egypt alone. But I want you to notice something which is really clear in

87
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,520
 the Hebrew, but it's also clear in the English. It says, "Every firstborn son in Egypt will die."

88
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:09,120
 What it doesn't say is, "Every firstborn son of Egypt will die." Are you with me, church?

89
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,160
 This is a very important distinction. Because God in chapter 4 had said, "Israel is my firstborn."

90
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,120
 You've got to bring that context now into here. And now God says, "There's this 10th plague coming,

91
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,840
 the killing of all firstborns in Egypt." And he actually gives a demonstration. He says,

92
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,920
 "Pharaoh's son will die, but also the son of the slave girl." Who are the slaves?

93
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:38,880
 This is something that's happening, God is saying, to both Egypt and Israel. And it's important that

94
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,680
 you understand this, God is saying. Because this is the plague, all the other nine plagues have

95
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,120
 impacted Egypt and have let Israel go. But this plague, this plague is for both of you.

96
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,800
 That picks up even further in chapter 12. Let me read you chapter 12, verse 12, probably the most

97
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,760
 important verse in the whole of the Passover narrative. "On that same night, I will pass

98
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,600
 through Egypt and strike down in the land of Egypt every firstborn man and animal. And I will bring

99
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,640
 judgment on all the gods of Egypt, for I am the Lord." There it is, "In all of the land of Egypt,

100
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,560
 every firstborn will die." This is really important, because Israel had to understand

101
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,320
 that they also were not right before God. Now, this wasn't just about God coming and saying to

102
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,560
 Egypt, "Hey, you guys have been nasty for 430 years, and you've treated my people as slaves,

103
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,880
 so I'm now going to be nasty to you." This is a God of justice. And a God of justice is not playing

104
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,320
 favorites here. And he's coming before both Egypt and Israel and saying, "Hey, Israel, don't think

105
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,880
 that this is not about you." Remember I said last week that God's call to let my people go was not

106
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,200
 just a call to Pharaoh in Egypt about the slavery they had caused for the Israelites. It was actually

107
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,760
 a call also for Israel about the slavery that they had created for themselves and their idolatry,

108
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,520
 that they needed to deal with their idolatry. And so God shows up and says, "Here's what's going to

109
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,520
 happen now. You're going to have to deal with your idolatry, because both your idolatry, Israel,

110
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,280
 and your slavery of my firstborn son's Egypt, both of those things have to receive justice.

111
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:22,800
 So I'm coming, and I'm going to kill every firstborn son in Egypt."

112
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:30,160
 Could you imagine how that would have felt for Israel? Because you'd be forgiven, wouldn't you,

113
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,720
 from thinking that maybe by this time in the narrative, Israel were kind of going, "Heh,

114
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,760
 this is all about those nasty Egyptians and what they've done to us for 430 years,

115
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,160
 and how they've been so nasty and mean to us. And look what God has done. The last nine plagues

116
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,600
 have given them that impression, because the nine plagues didn't touch Israel at all.

117
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,840
 But now everything changes." And the reason why this is really important for you to grasp

118
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,080
 is because when it comes to the idea of judgment for the sin and brokenness in the land,

119
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:10,800
 it involved everybody. God is not showing distinction or favoritism in the concept of

120
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:18,800
 justice in the land. If anybody has broken his law and broken his heart and broken sin in the land,

121
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,680
 that'll be judged by the 10th plague. That's a sobering thing that we all have to wrestle with.

122
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,400
 But the reason why that is powerful is because of what we see happen next. You see,

123
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:41,440
 God then says, "Israel, you're as guilty. And you need to understand and wrestle with the reality

124
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:52,320
 that you're just as guilty as the Egyptians. But in your guilt, Israel, you are my firstborn child.

125
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,560
 You are my firstborn son. And I'm covenanted in love with you. And so despite the fact that,

126
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,640
 yes, there is justice and judgment needed, I'm going to actually pay the price for that judgment

127
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:13,120
 and justice. Even though you are guilty and you need to understand that, Israel, I'm going to make

128
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,560
 a way for you. I'm going to make a way in my covenantal relationship for you that you don't

129
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,680
 need to go into impending death like the Egyptians. You're going to get to experience revived life."

130
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:38,640
 And here's the powerful thing. The only difference that there is between Israel and Egypt is this,

131
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:50,000
 blood. The only thing that is going to separate these two nations is nothing Israel's done.

132
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,120
 It's not their moral superiority. It is not the fact that they are just a special kind of people.

133
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,680
 It is only going to be this that will separate them, blood. And the question you should ask

134
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:11,600
 yourself when you're reading the Exodus story, why blood? Why is blood going to be the separating

135
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,760
 thing between Israel and Egypt in this moment? One thing that you may not have realized is that

136
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,200
 actually blood has been the background character in the whole of the Exodus story so far.

137
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,400
 Blood was right there at the start when the midwives bravely decided to stand

138
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,280
 against Pharaoh's decree to murder all the newborn Hebrew boys. Blood is there when

139
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:42,000
 Pharaoh decides to drown all of those Hebrew boys in the Nile. Blood is right there when Moses decides

140
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,520
 to take on the mantle of Savior himself and murder an Egyptian. Blood is there when he flees from

141
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,560
 Egypt and finds himself in the desert. And in the desert place, he actually defends his future wife

142
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,880
 Sapphora against an invading shepherd army. Blood is there. And then blood is there right in the

143
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,120
 first plague itself. The first plague is spoken about so profoundly as Moses stretching out his

144
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,640
 hand with his staff and touching the Nile River and the Nile turning to blood. Blood has been

145
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,680
 there the whole time. And because blood has been there, the great question we wrestle with is,

146
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:25,040
 what is it about blood, not just for the Israelites, but for the Egyptians that matters so much?

147
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,200
 Because when God chooses blood to be the differentiating factor between the two nations,

148
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,640
 it's because blood wasn't just important to Israel, it actually had something to say to Egypt too.

149
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:44,640
 In ancient Near Eastern Egyptian mythology, blood played a very central role. And to help you to

150
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,720
 understand that, I want to take you now back to Egypt once again. And I want to take you to where

151
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,560
 the Israelites lived in Egypt in those moments. It's a place called Goshen,

152
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,520
 because it is that place where we see the importance of blood. Let's take a look together.

153
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,400
 (birds chirping)

154
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:18,400
 (music)

155
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:24,000
 I've returned to these fields here behind me today because it is right here that perhaps the

156
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,680
 most significant moment of Jewish history took place. Behind me and buried in these fields is

157
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,320
 the ancient city of Avaris. It was the capital city of Egypt for the Hyksos, a Semitic group of

158
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,880
 people who invaded here during the 15th dynasty. But Avaris as a city was actually older than when

159
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,200
 the Hyksos was here. In fact, recent archaeological evidence has revealed the existence of an older,

160
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:55,120
 more sophisticated community that used to live here. And those people were from the Canaan Syria

161
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,680
 area. A Semitic group of people that moved in here, settled, grew to a really large number,

162
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,080
 and then all of a sudden left very quickly, right at about the time that Egypt's power was decreasing.

163
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:15,840
 All of which tells us this. It is very likely that right behind me here is exactly where the Passover

164
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:21,840
 took place, where God actually brought the final judgment on Egypt to release God's people and

165
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:29,040
 send them to the promised land. It happened right here. And here's how it happened. God actually

166
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,200
 came to the Jewish people and he told them to take a lamb and at twilight to sacrifice that lamb,

167
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,120
 dip their fingers in the blood and put it over the walls and doors of their home. In so doing,

168
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,080
 creating protection for them and their families. So I want you to track with this. There was an

169
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,320
 animal sacrifice. It created some shed blood and that blood was then used to create protection.

170
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:59,280
 Now, why is all of that important to our story? Well, what is it about blood that actually was

171
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,040
 the significant catalyst to releasing God's people into freedom? What is it about blood

172
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,040
 that was important, not just for the Israelites, but for the Egyptians as well? Well, to answer

173
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,640
 that question, I need to now take you back to the ancient temple in Talbasta and show you

174
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,200
 something there that will change your perception about what the Passover is all about.

175
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:31,600
 Since antiquity, blood has been recognized as the essential component of life. Without knowledge of

176
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,680
 the circulatory system, ancient Egyptian religion recognized the heart as the seat of the soul

177
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,840
 and all eternal life. But the Egyptians also saw blood as something hidden, visible only when

178
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,680
 flowing from a wound or during childbirth, miscarriage or menstruation. As such, blood

179
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,840
 became a symbol not just of life, but also of death, something that gives, but also something

180
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:03,120
 that takes away. Because of this, blood was deeply revered and to control blood was to literally hold

181
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,480
 in one's hands the power of life and death. This power was what animal sacrifice was all about

182
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,240
 in ancient Egyptian religion. And as blood was the central image of this power, the sacrifice

183
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,280
 of an animal to the gods revolved around the collection of the blood that was shed. Here in

184
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,320
 the museum of Talbasta is a great example of a sacrificial stone that was found in the temple

185
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,840
 of this area. The animal would have been placed on the top end of the stone slab where its throat

186
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,600
 would have been cut. The blood that came forth would then flow down these rivets, across towards

187
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,360
 the middle section, and then drain through the various holes you can see here, eventually flowing

188
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,400
 out of the bottom onto whatever was chosen to receive the blessing of the sacrifice.

189
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,720
 Interestingly, it was the flow of the blood that was important. The blood flowing out of the animal

190
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,720
 onto the stone signified the bringing of death. But the blood flowing out of the stone onto

191
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,680
 whatever icon or offering was below it signified the bringing of new life. This new life was

192
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,520
 understood as a form of protection, protecting the person from death through the sacrifice of another.

193
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,920
 Think about that for a second. Egyptian animal sacrifice was about the exercise of power through

194
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,760
 death and life and the protection it brings through the shedding of blood. And this is something that

195
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,720
 can still be seen in the Egyptian culture today.

196
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:43,120
 Around the time that the city of Cairo was first established, between 909 and 1171,

197
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,640
 the Fatimid Caliph ordered the slaughter of a large number of sheep and lamb as a declaration

198
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,480
 and protection to the city. After the slaughter took place, people were encouraged to leave traces

199
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,920
 of the blood as a sign of blessing on their property or brand new items that they owned.

200
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:13,360
 To this day, traditional Egyptian families continue this practice by

201
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,280
 dipping their hands in blood and placing it on their material goods, things like

202
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,640
 brand new cars, in order to show humility to their neighbors and honor to the gods.

203
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,680
 Now, let me pull together what we've been teaching about blood in Egyptian history and culture.

204
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,840
 See, for the Egyptians, blood was critical for three things. The blood actually said, first of

205
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:42,320
 all, that it symbolized the power over life and death. That blood also brought blessings and honor

206
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,960
 to the people. And finally, blood was a way of actually bringing protection for life. Like,

207
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,280
 if you wanted to be protected, you would use blood as that symbol. So, is it a wonder, then,

208
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:02,000
 that God chose the Passover as the thing to bring the final judgment to Pharaoh and the Egyptians?

209
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,760
 The very thing of asking the Israelites to take blood and to place it on the door frames of their

210
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,960
 property to symbolize protection and honor in that place. This was basically God saying, "Hey,

211
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,240
 Egypt, do you want to know who has the power of life and death? It's me. Hey, Egypt, do you want

212
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,480
 to know who can really protect you? It's me." It was God establishing His authority upon the

213
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,920
 Egyptian people. There's this verse in Leviticus that I love. It says, "The life of the flesh is

214
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:40,400
 in the blood." The Passover begins the Exodus narrative, and it does so by laying down perhaps

215
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,440
 the most foundational truth of our whole Christian story, that it truly is in the shedding of blood

216
00:22:47,440 --> 00:23:00,160
 that we are set free. It truly is in the shedding of blood that we are set free. I want to show you

217
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,800
 how God speaks of this bloodshed in the original Passover story. Verse 13 of chapter 12 says this,

218
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:15,200
 "This blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood,

219
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,440
 I will pass over. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt." The thing that

220
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,240
 God mentions about the blood right up front is it will be a sign to you. The blood was certainly a

221
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,960
 sign to Egypt like I just explained in the film. It was a sign to Egypt that all of the things that

222
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,840
 they had thought about with animal sacrifice really was only truly powerful in the hands of

223
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,240
 Yahweh, this one God. That the sacrifice to all this pantheon of Egyptian gods was useless and

224
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,640
 nothing. That no protection, honor, or life, which is what blood symbolized for the Egyptians,

225
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,360
 could ever happen through the worship of their Egyptian gods. It could only take place

226
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:03,200
 through Yahweh. The Passover was a sign to Egypt that this blood, the blood that has been shed on

227
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,080
 behalf of God's people, was the only blood that could truly set them free. But it was also a sign

228
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:18,000
 to Israel. It was a sign to them that God can provide a substitution to their sin. It was a

229
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,320
 sign of God saying to Israel itself, "Hey, you are guilty. There is a judgment that should come if

230
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,880
 I'm a God of justice. I have to bring that judgment, but I will provide a blood, an animal,

231
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,800
 who will be sacrificed as a substitution to that." And Israel learns that their sin and their

232
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:43,280
 brokenness can be covered by the blood of this animal. And I think for many in Israel, they would

233
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:48,320
 have remembered what happened to Abraham and Isaac. And now Abraham had gone up in that hill

234
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,800
 and was about to sacrifice Isaac, and God shows up and says, "No, there's another one for you.

235
00:24:52,800 --> 00:25:00,320
 There's a goat in a thicket for you, and that one will be a substitution for you." And now,

236
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,840
 here's Israel realizing that they have every reason to be judged, and God has shown up and

237
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:13,840
 said, "There is a substitution for you." My grace offered now through the reality of blood.

238
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,080
 So when Israel comes and they take that blood and they place it on their doorframes,

239
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,840
 here's what's going on in their minds. They're thinking to themselves, "I am guilty."

240
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,720
 They're thinking to themselves, "I should be blamed." They're thinking to themselves,

241
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,200
 "We didn't get away with it. We have broken things. We've broken our covenant with God."

242
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,960
 They've thought to themselves, "God has every right to come and take our firstborn. God has

243
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,520
 every right to come and do what he said he's going to do against us, as well as against Egypt. We're

244
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,720
 equally guilty, but this blood, this blood we're applying in hope, in faith, and in trust that if

245
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,160
 God sees this blood, if he understands that we are aligning ourselves to the reality that we know

246
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,840
 that we're guilty, but this blood can set us free, then maybe God will pass over us." This was a sign

247
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,000
 not just to Egypt and not just to Israel, but also a sign to God. The blood on the doorpost

248
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,440
 was a sign to God for God to say, "This family trusts in me. This family agrees with me."

249
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,000
 Because I want you to think about this for a second, because this is actually really important.

250
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,080
 You see, the actual sacrifice of the lamb itself was not the main thing. The taking of the lamb

251
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,240
 and sacrificing it and eating it that night was not the thing that was going to protect them and

252
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,400
 bring salvation. In fact, what Israel had to do was not just kill the animal, but then had to take

253
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,680
 the blood of that animal and apply it to the doorposts. And it was in the application of the

254
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,520
 blood that they were showing a moment of faith, a moment of trust. And any family of Israel that

255
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,680
 had just killed the lamb and not applied the blood would not be spared from the judgment that was

256
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:09,120
 coming. This act of faith, this act of trust made this whole original Passover the main teaching

257
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:17,040
 place for Israel themselves. Will we align ourselves to the hope that God has provided for us

258
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:24,800
 in the substitution for our sin? And so every home that had blood on the doorposts and blood

259
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:32,080
 on the walls, the destroyer, it says in the passage, passes over that home because of their faith.

260
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:39,760
 Are you with me? So there's a call on Israel to partake in the substitutional sacrifice

261
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,800
 that had been provided for it. And in so doing it, they found freedom and grace.

262
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:54,880
 They found the mercy of God. So the message of the plague of the firstborns is that God is holy

263
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,680
 and just. But the message of the Passover is that God is merciful. And in this way,

264
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:11,200
 through his infinite love, God makes it possible to be both just and forgiving at the same time.

265
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:20,960
 He actually paves the way for what our Christian faith completely sits upon.

266
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:29,760
 Should it surprise us then that the primary metaphor that the gospel writers use to speak

267
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,800
 of what Jesus does in his life and his death and his resurrection is the Passover imagery.

268
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,400
 In fact, the disciples at the time and the prophets at the time, they grab a hold of this

269
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,280
 really quite vicious type imagery and they begin to apply it to the reality of Jesus

270
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,760
 because they understand that no number of slain lambs would ever cover the reality of humanity's

271
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,080
 sin. And so they begin to look for God to provide a substitutional sacrifice that's different from

272
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:05,760
 just slain animals, which is why when Jesus walks past John the Baptist for the very first time

273
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,960
 at the very beginning of John chapter 1, John the Baptist says something out loud about Jesus. I want

274
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,840
 to read this to you from John chapter 1 verse 29. He says, "The next day John saw Jesus turning

275
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,520
 towards him or coming towards him and said, 'Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.'"

276
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,200
 No one told John about this. This wasn't like Jesus has performed all these miracles and Jesus

277
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,040
 has done all this stuff and they're beginning to connect the dots. This is a prophetic statement

278
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,160
 from John. The Holy Spirit is revealed to this in his spirit and he looks at Jesus before Jesus

279
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,960
 has done any ministry and he says, "This one is the Lamb of God. This one is going to be slain for the

280
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,400
 sins of the world. This one is going to be killed and if we take this one's blood and we apply it

281
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,960
 to ourselves, we will know what it is to be forgiven even though we carry sin." And this

282
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,400
 beautiful idea that Jesus somehow in his death and in the shedding of his blood was going to

283
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:08,000
 set people free becomes one of the primary ideas of the New Testament. In fact, all of these

284
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,520
 scriptures here draw that out from across the New Testament narrative. Things like, "Without the

285
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,440
 shedding of blood there is no forgiveness, that he might make atonement for the sins of his people.

286
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,760
 To him who loves us and has freed us from the sins by his blood." The whole of the New Testament is

287
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:29,040
 the blood of Jesus does this, but there's something that's still amiss. Should we take

288
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:37,040
 somehow the blood of Jesus and apply it to the doorposts of our homes now? How do we take the

289
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:43,600
 blood of Jesus and how do we make this a part of our faith, a part of who we are? How does actually

290
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:52,160
 the death and resurrection of Jesus pay the price for our sin? And it's almost as if God says,

291
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,760
 "You don't need to place blood on the doorposts of your home anymore, because I'm going to take

292
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,080
 the blood of my son Jesus and I'm going to place it on the doorframe of your heart."

293
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:11,360
 It's going to be like I literally kind of just reach out with my hand with the blood of Jesus

294
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,600
 and I cover your heart. I just do it right here. I just take it and cover your heart,

295
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,520
 your heart of darkness, the heart of brokenness, the heart of sin. I cover it with his blood.

296
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,000
 And when I cover it with his blood, I'm saying to you that you don't have to do anything to be set

297
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,960
 free, that the work of Jesus on the cross is for you. It's for you and your heart is covered now

298
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:43,120
 because I love you and I will provide the sacrifice for you. Are you with this?

299
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:52,320
 But just like Israel, who in the original Passover had to realize that the death of the

300
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,480
 animal was not enough, that they had to take the death of that animal and the blood of that animal

301
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,680
 and place it on the doorframes, so it is also for us. You see, Jesus' death on the cross is not a

302
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:09,840
 cure-all for all. It is not like a moment that universally suddenly cleans everybody of all of

303
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,520
 their sin and, "Hey, you can just live however you want for the rest of your life and everything's

304
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,960
 going to be perfectly fine. It doesn't matter because Jesus has paid the price for you." It's

305
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,800
 not a cure-all for everything. You, like Israel in the Old Testament Passover, have to apply the

306
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,360
 blood by faith. You have to dip your fingers in that blood, if you will, and you have to apply it

307
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,600
 on your heart. You have to be the one that says, "I believe that Jesus died on the cross for me.

308
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,360
 I believe that that is a substitutional sacrifice for me. I will take that blood that Jesus

309
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,600
 has shed on behalf of my sins and in taking it by faith, I apply it to myself through repentance of

310
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,880
 my sin and belief that Jesus is really the only Son of God. And in doing that, I align myself to

311
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:04,080
 the reality that Jesus died for me and for all of the world. And in faith, I apply that in belief

312
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,080
 and repentance and by saying it with my tongue, by baptism, by communion, by all the ways that I can,

313
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:20,240
 that I am aligned to the substitutional sacrifice of Jesus Christ. It sets me free. It sets me free.

314
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:30,000
 I don't need to fiddle with any doorposts, but I do need to keep my heart soft. I do need to choose

315
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:41,600
 in faith to walk with the blood of Jesus, to embrace that blood for me, for me. It shouldn't

316
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:49,440
 shock us then that when Jesus wants to explain about this sacrifice he's going to do, he uses

317
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,560
 the imagery of the old Passover to speak about it. In fact, what Jesus does just the night he's

318
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:01,360
 betrayed and arrested, he gathers his disciples in an upper room and he takes them at the very

319
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,280
 moment that they're celebrating the Passover, the very moment where they're celebrating the

320
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,360
 reality that this is what has happened in the Old Testament for the Jewish people in the past.

321
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:15,200
 He takes that moment and he says, "Now we're going to change it." And Jesus does something that has

322
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,120
 never been done in history before. He embodies himself into the story of the Passover. And he

323
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:28,880
 says, "I now am going to be the one who will be your sacrificial lamb, and my bloodshed will truly

324
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,920
 set you free." I want to read this to you, hopefully without getting blood on my Bible,

325
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:45,280
 from Luke chapter 22. It says...oh, it's so sticky. Are you with me, everybody? I can't do it. Lord

326
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:55,600
 Jesus. All right. Luke 22, starting in verse 7. "Then came the day of the unleavened bread on

327
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,120
 which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed. Jesus sent Peter and John saying, 'Go make

328
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,520
 preparations for us to eat the Passover.' 'Where do you want us to prepare for it?' they asked.

329
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,800
 Jump through to verse 14. 'When the hour came, Jesus and the apostles reclined at the table,

330
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,880
 and then he said to them, 'I've eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,

331
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,400
 for I tell you I will not eat of it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.'"

332
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,920
 There it is. "This Passover will find fulfillment in me. After taking the cup, he gave thanks and

333
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,920
 said, 'Take this, divide it among yourselves, for I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of

334
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,840
 the vine until the kingdom of God comes.' Then he takes the bread and he gives thanks, and he broke

335
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:37,440
 it and said to them, 'This, this is my body given to you. Do this in remembrance of me.' In the same

336
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,120
 way, after supper, he took the cup saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is now

337
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,920
 poured out for you.'" Jesus takes the imagery of the original Passover and he begins to apply it

338
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,000
 to himself and he says, "I am now your new Passover, and you don't need to smear stuff on

339
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,800
 on any kind of thing anymore. All you need to do is come around this new meal. I create a new way.

340
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,360
 Just take the bread and break it and share it amongst yourselves. It's my body. Take the cup,

341
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,520
 this cup, which is now the symbol of the shed blood of Jesus, and apply this to yourself.

342
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,720
 Take this now and allow this to become your lifeblood. This is being poured out for you so

343
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,320
 that you would know the forgiveness of sin, so that you wouldn't be judged, so that the Passover

344
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:33,360
 would happen for you." And what incredible encouragement it is. And I want you to sit

345
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:44,240
 with this final thought. This blows my mind. God chose his firstborn son to die. Have you noticed

346
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:51,680
 that? He takes the tenth plague, the one that he had against Egypt and against Israel, and he says,

347
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:59,440
 "If anyone's going to suffer in this plague, it's me. I will take my firstborn son, Jesus Christ."

348
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,320
 And he's going to go to the cross, willingly choose himself to go to the cross. He's going

349
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,440
 to have that moment in the Garden of Gethsemane where he's like, "Really, Lord?" And then he's

350
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,680
 going to go, "But let your will be done." And he will go freely to the cross, and he will give up

351
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,880
 his life because it's the ultimate example of love. It's the ultimate invitation into the freedom that

352
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,160
 comes from the blood that sets us free. It's our way now of gathering around this thing that we

353
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:28,080
 call communion and taking the bread and taking the cup to align ourselves in faith. This is our faith

354
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:38,720
 statement. It's us saying, "I agree that Jesus was God's lamb. I agree that I'm guilty, that I should

355
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:48,720
 be judged, but I also, thank God, agree that that judgment passes over me because even though I

356
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:59,120
 deserve it, his blood sets me free. For it really is in the shedding of blood that we are set free."

357
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:06,560
 What we're going to do in a moment is I'm going to invite you to come and take communion. If you've

358
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,520
 come here with family and friends, you're welcome to come and take communion as family and friends.

359
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,480
 I want to invite you to take the communion and pray together as family and friends. Here in the

360
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,120
 lower house, we're going to do the communion by inviting everybody here in the lower house to come

361
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,400
 forward to receive communion. We also have communion tables just here on the sides if it's easier for

362
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,360
 those in the fixed seating. For everybody here, you're invited to come around the doorway and take

363
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,360
 communion here. In the upper house, if we ask you to get out of your seats and come somewhere,

364
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:42,240
 it would be a nightmare. So for you guys, our team are now going to hand out communion to you as well.

365
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,120
 But for you as well, I want you to take your time. When you get the bread or the cup, you can pray

366
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,000
 with the people next to you. You can share in communion together. You can allow yourselves to

367
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,200
 come under this faith step of celebrating what God has done in the blood of Jesus. Whether we're here

368
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,160
 in the lower house or in the upper house, can I pray for us? Then you're going to have time

369
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,920
 to come and do communion. Father, I thank you for each person here. I thank you for your blood.

370
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,040
 I thank you that it really is your blood that sets us free. I thank you, Lord, that you

371
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:25,280
 are the Lamb of God, that you are the one who has sacrificed all everything so that we who might be

372
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,360
 guilty get to walk free. Father, that's the central thought of the Christian faith. And Lord, there

373
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,520
 might be people here in this room where they've never heard that before. Maybe some people in

374
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,360
 this room are online who don't know you. But Lord, they're here today and they've heard the most

375
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:48,240
 central gospel message there is, that God loves them. That God loves them so much that no matter

376
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,560
 what they've done, no matter what brokenness, what sin, whatever it is that they carry,

377
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,200
 by the blood of Jesus, they're forgiven. There's a Passover for you.

378
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,920
 And if you're here in this room today, and this is the first time you've heard this message,

379
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,760
 this is the first time you've heard that there is a God who so loves you, that he would send

380
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,120
 his only son to die for you so that you would be released from anything that you've done,

381
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:20,800
 that's good news. That's the best news that there is. And if that's you, I want to encourage you

382
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,800
 just to say a prayer in your heart as we take communion. And that prayer is just to come before

383
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:33,680
 God and say, "God, thank you. Thank you for dying for me. Thank you for dying for the things that

384
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,120
 I've done in my life that I'm not proud of. I ask you to forgive me of what I've done.

385
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:47,920
 And I ask you to set me free from it by your blood. And I receive your sacrifice

386
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:57,600
 on my behalf. Thank you, Lord." It's a very simple prayer. "Thank you. Please forgive me."

387
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:04,000
 And then thank you again. And then you do that, you're doing that step of faith that I talked

388
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,240
 about. You're taking the death of Jesus and then applying it to yourself. And that means that you

389
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,320
 become one of his children, that you become a firstborn son of God, a firstborn child of God.

390
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,320
 And it's the most amazing, wonderful thing. So if that's you here today for the first time,

391
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,320
 we welcome you to pray that prayer and come and speak to us afterwards. And we'd love to tell

392
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,280
 you a little bit more about what it means to be a Christian. But for the rest of us,

393
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:36,800
 this is communion now. This is your time. You don't need to rush it. It's your time to engage

394
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:46,320
 in the bread and the cup and receive the grace that Christ's sacrifice gives for you.

395
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:56,320
