1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 and meeting you.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Lord, we pray all this in Jesus' name.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Everyone says, amen.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Amen.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Have a seat, have a seat.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 My name's Andrew.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I'm one of the pastors here.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 If you've just joined the Vine or only been a part of us

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 for a little while, we're so glad that you are here with us.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 We're in a series on the Holy Spirit.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 We've been opening the scriptures around the Spirit each week.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And I want to share out of a passage of the Apostle Paul writing

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 to the church in Ephesus.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Paul was a prolific man of prayer, loved to pray for people,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 loved to pray for his church.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 He was deeply pastoral.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 And in the book of Ephesians, he actually prays a number of times.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Often when Paul prays, he's not just kind of like offering a prayer.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 He's not just like Lord Jesus, amen kind of thing.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 He's actually trying to communicate and teach something to the church.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 His prayers are some of the deepest theological things that are found

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 in his word.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And we're going to unpack them and get a sense of how he wants

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 to pastor his church.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And in the prayer I'm going to read you here this morning,

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 he says something about the Spirit.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And what he says about the Spirit is one of these paradoxes

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 that we're going to be unpacking throughout our series,

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 these both and elements of the Spirit.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 And this one is particularly key because this one draws us

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 into a deeper knowledge of God himself.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Let me read this to you from Ephesians 1, starting in verse 15.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 He says, "For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers."

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And here's what I pray.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 "I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 the glorious Father, may give to you the Spirit,"

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 or in other translations, "that the Spirit would give to you

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 wisdom and revelation so that you may know him better."

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Father, our prayer this morning as we gather in this room

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 and the overflow online is that that would happen in us.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 That as you open your scriptures to us, as you speak a fresh word to us,

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 that we would come to know you deeper, better.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And Lord, I believe that you have a personal thing

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 that you want to say to every person in this room here this morning.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And just as Emma has so beautifully prepared us,

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 as we've brought that sacrifice of praise to you,

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 as we've entered your gates with thanksgiving in our hearts,

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Lord, we pray now that you would reveal the innermost sort of passions

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 and love that you have in your heart for each person in this room.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Everyone says.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 So a number of years ago, my wife and I, Christine,

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 we were in Bible school in Auckland in New Zealand.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And my wife's from New Zealand, so when we decided to go to Bible school,

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 we looked at lots of places we could have gone to.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 We decided New Zealand was the place.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Auckland was the Bible school that we wanted to go to.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And it was a great place. We loved it.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 But we always wanted to get out of Auckland and explore New Zealand.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So on one particular long weekend, we decided we were going to take

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 a four-hour drive up to the north of New Zealand.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Now, the further you go north in New Zealand, the less people there are.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 There's not a lot of people in New Zealand in general.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 But the further north you go, the less people there are.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And a friend of ours had a house in a place called Russell,

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 which is kind of northeast on the North Island.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And so from where we were in Auckland to get there, it's about four hours.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 We had lectures all day, so we had to stay.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 But we decided to leave at around about six o'clock at night.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 About three hours in, around about nine o'clock,

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 we knew that we would enter into this village.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And we had seen on the map that this village was the last,

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 largest populated area before we would end up where we were going to go.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And so if we needed to eat, if we were going to eat some food,

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 we needed to stop in this particular village.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 On the map, it looked like a decent-sized village.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And I've come to learn that New Zealand kind of exaggerates

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 the size of their towns on maps to make themselves feel a bit better.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And so we arrive at this town at like nine o'clock at night,

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 and it literally was like way smaller than we were predicting.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 It only had like one little road where there were some restaurants.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And we were there, like I say, about nine o'clock.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And so most of the restaurants there were shut.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 In fact, there was only one restaurant that was open

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 at that particular time on that particular night.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Only one restaurant.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I wonder if you could imagine with me what type of restaurant it was

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 that was open at nine o'clock at night in the middle of nowhere in New Zealand.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Anyone get it?

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 It was a Chinese takeaway restaurant.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Yes, it was.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And not just a Chinese takeaway restaurant.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 No, no, no, no, no.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 It was a Hong Kong-style Chinese takeaway.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I could tell right away this looked like a dai pai dong from Mongkok or something, right?

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Like it just reeked Hong Kong.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And of course, we were homesick at the time,

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 and I was like, "Oh, my gosh, this is so amazing.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 There's a Hong Kong Chinese restaurant. It's open."

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And it kind of, in the front of its door,

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 it had like the beads that kind of go down to keep the flies out and stuff.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And I said to Chris, I said, "I'm going to go in there,

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 and I'm going to whip out my best Cantonese."

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 You know, like I haven't spoken Cantonese for a while.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 This is going to be awesome.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And so sure enough, I was like, "Wah, wah,"

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 and I jumped into this restaurant.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I'm like, "Wah, ay-ya.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 What would I like to eat today?

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Wah, wah, wah, please, please, please.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 I don't want to eat char siu fan.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Please, quickly, quickly. It hurts so much."

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 So, thank you, thank you, thank you.

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 So I whip out my amazing, immaculate, perfectly pronounced Cantonese.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 The man behind the counter, he's like 80 years old.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 He's like the kind of guy when you go into a restaurant here,

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 has like a cigarette hanging out of their mouth, you know,

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 like with the ash that's like, you know, going to fall into the thing.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Like he's 80 years old, the oldest Chinese guy I think I've seen in a while.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 He's like so wrinkled and stuff.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 But as he hears my Cantonese, his face, he starts to smile.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Like this smile comes, literally years of youth enter his face.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 It's like he suddenly becomes a new man.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 He's so excited that there's somebody in his restaurant speaking Cantonese.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 It's almost like him and his wife must have decided

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 they're going to plant a restaurant in the middle of this Chinese village

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 or this village in New Zealand, and they get there,

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 and they speak no Chinese for miles around, right?

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 He's never heard Cantonese for years.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Here's this white guy speaking Cantonese in his restaurant.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 He thinks this is the greatest thing that has ever happened to him.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 So he starts speaking Cantonese back at me.

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And I tell you, he was like...

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Little does he know that I've exhausted every piece of Cantonese I have ever spoken.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 But he doesn't know that. He's just going...

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I'm like, "Hi, hi, hi."

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Pretending like I know what's going on, right?

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 At one point, he tells a joke. I'm assuming because he laughs.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I'm like...

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 At one point, I know he asked me a question

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 because at the end of what he was saying, he's like, "Ah."

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 It's like...

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And then he pauses and looks at me, and I'm like...

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And then he just keeps going.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 This guy, like years washed off him

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 and somebody had entered in and spoken just a little bit,

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 a little utterance of the native language that was in his heart.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Every human being is made in the image of God.

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And every human being has the same singular heart language

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 embedded in their soul.

153
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And it's the heart language of the Spirit of God.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And whether they know it or not,

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 whether they believe in God or not,

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 every single human being has a longing,

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 a crying, a desperation deep within their soul

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 to connect with the living God.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And the Spirit of God speaks.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And when the Spirit of God speaks into the person

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 whose heart has long not heard

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 the very language that brings them alive,

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 they can't help but be changed.

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I mean, that guy in that restaurant that night

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 hearing Cantonese changed him.

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 He kind of came alive.

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 But I tell you what, when the Spirit of God speaks,

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 when the Spirit of God speaks a word in season,

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 when the Spirit of God says something

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 or brings something in the Scriptures alive to us,

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 it literally comes and changes and transforms us.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 The work of the Spirit of God,

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 the voice of the Spirit in our lives

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 is designed to change us, to heal our hearts,

175
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 to make us anew.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 What I was teaching us in week one

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 about going from disorder to order,

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 that's the purpose of the reason why the Spirit speaks.

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 I mean, think about that for a moment.

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 The very reason that the Spirit speaks

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 is so that He can move His people

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 from a place of disorder into a place of order.

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 The Spirit communicates in order to change us.

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 He changes us by communicating to us.

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Does that make sense?

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And when that voice comes,

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 when we hear it deep within ourselves,

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 everything shifts, everything begins to change.

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And like I said in week one,

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 it's because the Holy Spirit is a person.

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 And because the Holy Spirit is a person,

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 He longs to be in relationship with us,

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 that connection that we can have with the Spirit.

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 We saw in week one that there was this idea

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 of the fellowship of the Spirit.

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 So our connection point to the Spirit

197
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 is found in this kind of reciprocal relationship

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 we can have in communication.

199
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Him communicating to us so that we are changed

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 and us communicating with Him

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 and deepening our relationship with God.

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And the reason why this is all taking place

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 is because God longs to bring into all of us

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 clarity and focus.

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 He loves to bring into all of us wholeness.

206
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 It's that order that the Spirit of God

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 is moving us towards.

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 He wants you to be whole,

209
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 to be clear about life,

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 to move out of confusion.

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 When the Spirit speaks,

212
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 it's never to bring confusion.

213
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 It's always to turn confusion on its head.

214
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 The Spirit always wants to bring clarity

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 and refreshment and newness and wholeness to you.

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 That doesn't mean, though,

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 that every time the Spirit speaks,

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 it's gonna be something you're gonna wanna hear.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 So often when the Spirit speaks,

220
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 the Spirit actually does the contrary.

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 He actually says something that we don't want to hear,

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 but we need to hear.

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Doesn't mean always that the Spirit

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 has such nice things to say.

225
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Sometimes the Word comes from the Spirit

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 that actually shapes and changes

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 'cause He needs to disrupt the disorder

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 in order to bring the order.

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 But no matter how it happens,

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 the Spirit's Word changes all.

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 If I was to summarize it,

232
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 I would put it like this.

233
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 The Spirit's goal is to communicate to you

234
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 so that you would receive clarity,

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 wisdom, and understanding

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 so that you would be strengthened,

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 comforted, and changed.

238
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 That's a good slide to take a photo of

239
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 if you wanna take a slide photo.

240
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 This idea that He wants to bring clarity

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 and wisdom and understanding into us

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 so that we would be strengthened,

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 comforted, and changed

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 is the work of the Spirit.

245
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 It's that native language that sits within all of us

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 and when we hear the Spirit,

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 something within us begins to shift,

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 something within us begins to change.

249
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And why do we change?

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Because the Spirit leads us to the person of Jesus.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Remember, it's Jesus that changes everything.

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 And the Spirit's role is to illuminate Jesus,

253
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 to help us to see Jesus clearer and better

254
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 so that in Jesus we can be transformed and renewed.

255
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 In the same way that Jesus' role is to reveal the Father,

256
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 the Spirit's role is to reveal Jesus.

257
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 You following?

258
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So it's the Spirit speaks to us in that native language

259
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 that all of our souls are crying out for

260
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 so that we would see Jesus more clearly

261
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 so that we would ultimately come to know the Father.

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 The Spirit into Jesus, Jesus into the Father,

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 the triune Godhead at work

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 because God's voice is at work.

265
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 This is why when Paul picks up this prayer for the church,

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 he wants to help them to understand how the Spirit

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 connects us to Jesus so that we can know the Father.

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And he mentions this next kind of and/or paradox

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 that we're looking at,

270
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 or the both/and paradox that we're looking at in this series.

271
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And it's the idea of teaching and revelation.

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Let me read this to you from Ephesians 1 verse 17 again.

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 "I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,

274
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 the glorious Father, may give you the spirit of wisdom

275
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 and revelation," or in other translations,

276
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 "the spirit that brings wisdom and revelation

277
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 so that you may know Him better."

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Now, that's not the Spirit of God.

279
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Now, before I break this down into its individual parts,

280
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 let me step you back for a moment

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 and you need to see the whole.

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 It's so beautiful what Paul is saying here.

283
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 He's praying to the church.

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 His desire for them is to know God more.

285
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 He wants them to know God better,

286
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 and he understands that the only way

287
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 that they're gonna know God better

288
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 is through the work of the Spirit in teaching and revelation.

289
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 That teaching and revelation provides for us,

290
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 as Paul writes it here, "wisdom and revelation."

291
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 It provides for us the pathway

292
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 to be able to get to know Jesus better.

293
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 An analogy might be to think of this

294
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 a little bit like Zacchaeus in Luke chapter 19.

295
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 You'll be perhaps familiar with the story of Zacchaeus.

296
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Zacchaeus, we're told in the Scriptures, was a short person,

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 and because he was short, he didn't have the stature

298
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 to see over the crowd in order to capture

299
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 a good glimpse of Jesus.

300
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And on this one particular day, Jesus is walking by,

301
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 but Zacchaeus, being small, can't see him properly

302
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 through the crowd, and so Zacchaeus does a smart thing.

303
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 He runs ahead, finds a tree.

304
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 He climbs up this tree so he can get a clear view of Jesus.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And then Jesus and him lock eyes together,

306
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 and Zacchaeus invites Jesus to his house,

307
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 and Jesus transforms not just Zacchaeus' life,

308
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 but his whole family life.

309
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 It's a beautiful part of Scripture.

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 I think that's analogous to what Paul

311
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 is trying to communicate here.

312
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Every single one of us, if you will, we're short in stature

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 when it comes to being able to see Jesus.

314
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Our sin, our brokenness, and our flesh does not work

315
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 to help us to see Jesus more clearly.

316
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Our sin is a little bit like a crowd in front of us,

317
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 a crowd that's taller than we are,

318
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 so that we're not able to be able to connect and see Jesus,

319
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 but God has provided for us a way that we can move up

320
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 above that sin, above that brokenness,

321
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 to deal with it, if you will.

322
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 It's a tree of his teaching and revelation by the Spirit.

323
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And as we go up that tree, we actually get a clearer view

324
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 of who Jesus is.

325
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 That's what Paul says here.

326
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 "I hope that the Spirit comes to bring you wisdom

327
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 "and revelation so you will see him better,

328
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 "know him better, engage with him better,

329
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 "so that you can lift yourself out of the crowd

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 "towards the vision of Jesus, who changes everything."

331
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 I wonder whether here this morning we might have

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 some time to climb that tree together.

333
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 I want to unpack for you what this wisdom and revelation,

334
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 teaching and revelation, this two sides of this

335
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 both and paradox of the Spirit is all about for you.

336
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Paul begins with this idea of wisdom.

337
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 He uses the word wisdom here.

338
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 He's actually talking about this process

339
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 of the Spirit teaching.

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I'll connect the two of them together in a moment.

341
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 But he starts out by saying, look,

342
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 he's gonna bring a spirit of wisdom

343
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 so you can know him better.

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 The Greek word that Paul chooses here for wisdom,

345
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 somewhat unique in this part of the Scriptures,

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 and it's a word that has a lot of different things

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 that come together to help you understand it.

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 But essentially it means to illuminate,

349
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 to make clear, to bring understanding,

350
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 to give clarity.

351
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 So the idea of wisdom is to take something,

352
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 now this is really important, listen to this,

353
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 take something that is already known

354
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 and help us to understand it, illuminate,

355
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 shine a light on something that is already present,

356
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 already known, and help us to understand it

357
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 so we can then embrace it for our lives.

358
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 This is the concept that Paul's trying to communicate

359
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 about how the Spirit works in us.

360
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 It brings us understanding, illumination,

361
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 teaching of what has already been given to us.

362
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Now this is really important that you notice

363
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 that what it's emphasizing is something

364
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 that's already been given.

365
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 The teaching side is like, hey, I've given you something,

366
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 whether that's my presence in the world

367
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 or particularly of course the Scriptures themselves,

368
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 the Word of God contained for us in the Bible,

369
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 and he's like, my Spirit will help you and teach you

370
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 so that he will illuminate so that you will come

371
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 to a better understanding, so that you will come

372
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 to see Jesus more clearly.

373
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 The reality is these are just words on a page

374
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 without the work of the Spirit in our lives.

375
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And words on a page have never changed or transformed anyone.

376
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 They might have given somebody some knowledge of something,

377
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 some understanding of it, but it's not transformative.

378
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And what Paul's saying is my prayer is that the Spirit

379
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 will come to teach you, to illuminate, to reveal,

380
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 to strengthen, to help you to see more clearly

381
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 the very thing that he's already given you.

382
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 That make sense?

383
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Now Jesus himself actually taught this.

384
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Let me show you Jesus speaking to the disciples

385
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 in chapter 14 of John.

386
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 He puts it this way.

387
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 He says, "But the counselor or the advocate,

388
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 "the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name

389
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 "will," notice this, "teach you all things

390
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 "and remind you of everything I've said to you."

391
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So this is Jesus kind of taking the same concept

392
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 that Paul's speaking about, and Jesus is saying,

393
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 look, here's what you need to understand.

394
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 The Spirit is gonna come and the Spirit

395
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 will teach you all things, illuminate all things.

396
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And remind you of the things that I've already said to you.

397
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 In other words, there's already stuff out there.

398
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 There's my word that I've already communicated,

399
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 whether that's to you directly, audibly,

400
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 or whether it's written down in the Scriptures.

401
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 For them it was, of course, the Old Testament.

402
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 He said, "In all of that, the Spirit will illuminate it

403
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 "so you will know me better."

404
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 So he will remind you of all of the things

405
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 that I have said to you.

406
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 This is how you begin to climb the tree.

407
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Anyone here ever open the Bible and fallen asleep?

408
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Come on, church, let me see the hands, be honest.

409
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 That's pretty much every single one of us, I know.

410
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 I've been a Christian for 30 years, I understand, okay?

411
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Even as a pastor, I open the Word sometimes

412
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 and I'm tempted to fall asleep.

413
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Here's a trick.

414
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 If you ever wanna stay awake reading the Scriptures,

415
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 here's a trick.

416
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 When you open the Scriptures, before you read it,

417
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 just pray a simple prayer.

418
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Holy Spirit, would you teach me?

419
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 I invite you to teach me your Word

420
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 so I could become more like Christ Jesus.

421
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 If you pray that every single time you open God's Word,

422
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 you are aligning yourself to the Spirit of God.

423
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 You are aligning yourself to the very thing

424
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 that the Spirit was designed to do,

425
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 which is to illuminate what has already been given,

426
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 to teach you, equip you in what has already been given.

427
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Does that make sense?

428
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 So that's an important prayer to pray

429
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 when you're coming to read Scripture.

430
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Now, this all then brings us back to why Paul writes wisdom here

431
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 rather than the word teaching,

432
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 because the whole point is to make us more and more like Christ Jesus.

433
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Notice what he says.

434
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 He says, "So that you would gain wisdom,

435
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 so that you may know Him better."

436
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Wisdom is this Hebrew concept

437
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 that is beyond just knowing something.

438
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 When the Hebrews spoke about wisdom,

439
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 what it was was it was a lifestyle,

440
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 not just a mental information thing.

441
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 In other words, for Paul, his prayer is

442
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 when the Spirit teaches us,

443
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 it doesn't just give us right information,

444
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 it also leads us towards right application.

445
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And this is really important for Paul

446
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 because he wants you to understand

447
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 that you are a fool, the opposite of wisdom,

448
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 if you allow the Spirit to give you understanding

449
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 and you do nothing with it.

450
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 That if you get illuminated in the Scriptures,

451
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 you learn something about God

452
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 and you learn something about His character and His ways

453
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 and you walk away and don't change.

454
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 He's like, "You're a fool if that's what you think."

455
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Now, the Spirit is here to bring wisdom.

456
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And wisdom, the wise,

457
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 are ones who not only are illuminated by the Spirit

458
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 but then decide to put that into practice in their lives,

459
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 decide to live differently, act differently,

460
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 think differently under the power

461
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 and the leading and the guiding of the Spirit.

462
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Those are the ones that have actually been taught

463
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 by the Spirit, Paul is saying.

464
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And my prayer is that you would receive

465
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 the Spirit that teaches you to wisdom,

466
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 not teaches you to foolishness,

467
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 teaches you to wisdom.

468
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So, the first part of this paradox

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 is that the Spirit teaches us the things

470
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 that are already there

471
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 and helps us to be illuminated, to understand,

472
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 so we can apply that into our lives.

473
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 But then there's the second side of this paradox.

474
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 The word he uses here is revelation.

475
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Think of it this way.

476
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 The Spirit does not just illuminate

477
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 the word that's already received.

478
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 The Spirit also reveals the word that is yet to come.

479
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 This idea of revelation,

480
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 the other side of the Spirit's work here,

481
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 is literally the Greek word for revelation

482
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 that Paul uses here,

483
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 is literally translated like this,

484
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 to kind of disclose or to reveal

485
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 something that was previously unknown.

486
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 So, notice this, guys.

487
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Where teaching was about taking what was known

488
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 and helping it to be understood and applied.

489
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Does that make sense? Follow that?

490
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Revelation is taking the things

491
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 that are not previously known

492
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 and bringing them to us.

493
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 So there are both of these moments at work.

494
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And it's really important that you understand

495
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 that these never contradict themselves.

496
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 They're all from the same source,

497
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 and that's the Father.

498
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 And when the Father works in this world,

499
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 he works by illuminating the things

500
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 he's already given,

501
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 and he brings a fresh revelation,

502
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 a fresh perspective,

503
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 a fresh idea of perhaps things

504
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 that we had never even thought about before.

505
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 And both of those things work together,

506
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 never contradict each other.

507
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 In fact, that's how we test

508
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 whether revelation is really from the God or not.

509
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 'Cause let's face it,

510
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 sometimes we can hear some pretty weird things.

511
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Sometimes we can eat a really spicy curry

512
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and have a crazy thought afterwards

513
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 and think that that might be Jesus.

514
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 The way that we take revelation

515
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 and know that it is from him

516
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 is we link it to scripture.

517
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 It will never contradict it.

518
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 It will always work together.

519
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 But you need to know

520
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 that it's not just about discovering

521
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 the word that's here.

522
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 There's also the spoken word of God

523
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 in the here and now.

524
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And those things are beautiful

525
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 because they're both the work of the Spirit,

526
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 and they both help us, the tree,

527
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 to climb to be able to see Jesus more clearly.

528
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I mean, just step back from this for a moment

529
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 and reflect on this.

530
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 We don't have a God

531
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 who decided to speak to a bunch of people

532
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 2,000 years ago and then went silent.

533
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 We do have a God who spoke to a bunch of people

534
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 2,000 years ago,

535
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 captured in the word of God,

536
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 which is a rich depository

537
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 of grace and goodness and life eternal.

538
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 But we also have a God

539
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 who's still speaking today,

540
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 a God whose voice is still at work

541
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 so that those souls

542
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 who are crying out for connection

543
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 come alive,

544
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 so that like that man in the restaurant

545
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 whose literally ears

546
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 just dropped off his face

547
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 when he heard that language,

548
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 so people can still be caught up

549
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 in the wonder of a God

550
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 who speaks in this moment.

551
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 And when God speaks,

552
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 he opens up for us this idea

553
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 of things that might be going on in our lives,

554
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 maybe things that nobody else knows,

555
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 only God knows.

556
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And God brings a word or a picture

557
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 or even illuminates a scripture

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 that helps to transform something within us.

559
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And we're like,

560
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 so many times when people listen

561
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 to people speak here at the Vine,

562
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 oftentimes when I'm talking to them afterwards,

563
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 they're like, "Well, it was just like

564
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 "that person was speaking directly to me."

565
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And I'm like, "Yes, that's the Holy Spirit

566
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 "at work for you,

567
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 "bringing a revelation

568
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 "of something he wants you to be aware of

569
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 "that you previously were not aware of."

570
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 It's a wonder when he does that.

571
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Paul, writing just to the church in Corinth,

572
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 unpacks this concept a little bit more.

573
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 So I want to dig into this

574
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 just a little bit more for you.

575
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 So this is 1 Corinthians 2,

576
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 starting in verse 6.

577
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 He writes to the church, he says,

578
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 "We do, however, speak a message of wisdom

579
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 "amongst the mature."

580
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 There again, he talks about wisdom,

581
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 the teaching and the application of God's word,

582
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 "but not the wisdom of this age

583
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 "or the rulers of this age,

584
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 "who are coming to nothing."

585
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 So Paul wants you to know

586
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 that there is not just God's wisdom,

587
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 there's also the wisdom of this age.

588
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 And I tell you what,

589
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 you will always battle as a Christian

590
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 between which of those two things

591
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 you apply to your life.

592
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And if you're anything like me,

593
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 you apply that one,

594
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 sometimes almost as much as you apply this one.

595
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 This one being the word of God, by the way,

596
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 the wisdom of God.

597
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Do you know what I'm saying?

598
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 I think we wrestle with this, don't we?

599
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 The wisdom of the world,

600
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 which seems so tempting

601
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 and seems so seductive to us,

602
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 and God's wisdom.

603
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Paul says there is wisdom out there,

604
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 the wisdom of the world,

605
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 but we have a different wisdom, he says,

606
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 one that's been spoken amongst the mature.

607
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Verse seven, "No, we speak of God's mystery,

608
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 "God's wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden,

609
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 "so therefore it wasn't known before,

610
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 "that God has destined for our glory before time began.

611
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 "None of the rulers of this age understood it,

612
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 "for if they had, they would not have crucified

613
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 "the Lord of glory.

614
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 "However, here's what's been written in the scriptures,

615
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 "no eye has seen, no ear has heard,

616
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 "no mind has conceived,

617
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 "what God has prepared for those who love him."

618
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 You need to know in this room today

619
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 that if you love Jesus,

620
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 God has a lot prepared for you.

621
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 He's prepared things for you,

622
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 'cause he loves you.

623
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Things that he's set aside,

624
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 things that he's prepared in his written word

625
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 that are to be illuminated and brought alive in your life,

626
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 and things that he's prepared

627
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 that he wants to say to you directly

628
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 and personally by his spirit.

629
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 How does this happen?

630
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Notice verse 10.

631
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 "But God has revealed it to us."

632
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 By what?

633
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 By his spirit.

634
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 "The spirit searches all things,

635
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 "even the deep things of God,

636
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 "for who among people know the thoughts of a person

637
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 "except that person's spirit within them?

638
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 "In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God,"

639
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 here it is,

640
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 "except the spirit of God.

641
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 "We have not received the spirit of this world,

642
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 "but the spirit who is from God,

643
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 "that we may understand what God has freely given to us.

644
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 "That is what we speak,

645
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 "not in words taught by human wisdom,

646
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 "but in words taught by the spirit."

647
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Notice this,

648
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 "Explaining spiritual realities by spirit-taught words."

649
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 That's revelation, my friends.

650
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 I don't know about you,

651
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 but that's what I want in my life.

652
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 I wanna look out on this world

653
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 and not see physical reality,

654
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 but spiritual reality.

655
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 I wanna see spiritual reality in my life.

656
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 I want the Holy Spirit

657
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 to explain spiritual realities within me

658
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 and spiritual realities in my city of Hong Kong

659
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 with spirit-taught words.

660
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Not from the wisdom of this world,

661
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 but the wisdom that can only come

662
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 from the one who is still speaking today.

663
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 When we hear spirit-taught words,

664
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 it brings us into spiritual reality.

665
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 So Paul is saying,

666
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 "Look, you need to sit with this tension

667
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 "of the both and and.

668
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 "It's not just the word,

669
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 "it's all about the word.

670
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 "And it's not just revelation."

671
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 He's like, "It's both of these things working together.

672
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 "The word that is illuminated by the spirit

673
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 "to great understanding and application

674
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 "and the revelation of the spiritual realities

675
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 "of this world and of our lives

676
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 "by spirit-taught words that can only come from God

677
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 "because only the spirit searches

678
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 "the innermost realms of God."

679
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 This was happening in the gatherings

680
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 that Paul's early church was in in those days.

681
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 This was happening all over the place.

682
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 In fact, actually in Corinth,

683
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 it was happening so much

684
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 that there was kind of disorder happening in the church.

685
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And remember, the spirit is here to take disorder to order.

686
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 So Paul writes to the church

687
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 about this disorder that's happening in their gatherings

688
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 because there's so many kind of things happening,

689
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 particularly the abuse of tongues,

690
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 which maybe we'll get to in another week here.

691
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 But in this moment, he writes them to understand,

692
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 "Look, there needs to be order,

693
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 "and there can be order if you quieten down

694
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 "and open your ears to hear what the spirit says."

695
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Let me show you this in 1 Corinthians 14,

696
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 verses one to three.

697
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 He says, "Follow the way of love

698
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 "and eagerly desire spiritual gifts."

699
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Pastor Ellison's gonna preach on spiritual gifts

700
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 in a few weeks' time,

701
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 "especially the gift of prophecy.

702
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 "For anyone who speaks in a tongue

703
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 "does not speak to people but to God.

704
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 "Indeed, no one understands that person.

705
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 "They utter mysteries within their spirit.

706
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 "But everyone who prophesies speaks to people

707
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 "for their strengthening, encouragement, and comfort."

708
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I love this.

709
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Paul's saying, "This is why I want you

710
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 "to eagerly desire prophecy in your midst,

711
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 "because when the spirit speaks, revelation comes,

712
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 "it is for the strengthening,

713
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 "it is for the encouragement,

714
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 "and it is for the comfort of the church."

715
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And he's like, "Why would you not want that?"

716
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Like he's like, "Embrace prophecy amongst you.

717
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 "Embrace the work of the spirit amongst you."

718
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 'Cause yes, he's gonna illuminate and teach you

719
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 and apply the word so good,

720
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 but he's also gonna bring that life-changing moment word

721
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 that speaks in your life,

722
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 and you're like, "How did the spirit know

723
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 "about that work thing that's going on?

724
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 "Because I haven't told anyone about it."

725
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And suddenly this word comes,

726
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 spiritual realities by spirit-taught words,

727
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 that changes everything for us,

728
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 and like that restaurant and that guy,

729
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 everything drops off us,

730
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 and we become the people that we were created to be.

731
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Understanding, revelation, teaching,

732
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 God's word coming together

733
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 and making us into the people

734
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 that we were designed to be, disorder into order.

735
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Over our time together, hopefully today,

736
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 I've done the best that I can

737
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 in the teaching part,

738
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 helping to illuminate the scriptures

739
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 so that we can both know and apply God better,

740
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 but we wanna now take some time on the revelation part.

741
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And during our service at our pre-service part time,

742
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 and during our worship time,

743
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 our pastors and our prayer ministers here at the Vine,

744
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 they've been praying and asking

745
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 for specifically spirit-taught words,

746
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 revelation, prophetic words,

747
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 that are spoken to us so that we can speak them to you,

748
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 so that we can begin to listen

749
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 to the word of God that way together.

750
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 I'm so excited about this.

751
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Would you stand with me?

752
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And as you stand, I want you to do two things.

753
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Number one, everybody look at me.

754
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Is everybody looking at me?

755
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Good looking, right?

756
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Okay, you're looking at me because here's the thing,

757
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 do not leave.

758
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Hear from your pastor, do not leave.

759
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 The Lord has something he wants to say to you, amen?

760
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 That's the first thing.

761
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Second thing, I wanna encourage you just to open your hands,

762
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 because as we open our hands,

763
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 we're in a posture of receiving before the Holy Spirit.

764
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 And I wanna pray for us,

765
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 and then we're gonna listen to some spirit-taught words.

766
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Holy Spirit, we thank you for the teaching and revelation

767
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 that you have poured out on your church

768
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 so that we could climb that tree and see you clearly.

769
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 And Lord, in this moment, we ask you to speak.

770
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Holy Spirit, would you speak?

771
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Lord, I believe that you have a word

772
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 for a lot of people in this room,

773
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 a word that doesn't come from human wisdom,

774
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 human strength,

775
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 but a word that comes from your spirit.

776
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 So Lord, we pray that you would speak.

777
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 And that in these words that are about to be spoken,

778
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 many people here would come alive.

779
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 So just keep yourself in a posture of receiving.

780
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 I'm gonna make space now for any of the pastors,

781
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 prayer ministers,

782
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 who have a word for people in this room

783
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 to come forward and share that word.

784
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 (soft music)

785
00:33:44,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 I got the word tear, tears.

786
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 In Psalm 56, eight, it says,

787
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 "You have taken account of my wanderings.

788
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 "Put my tears in your bottle.

789
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 "Are they not in your book?"

790
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 So if you're someone who's really tired of your tears,

791
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 pause for looking for answers, but just seek God.

792
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 I wanna echo what Beth just shared.

793
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 It's just for those of you

794
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 who are maybe struggling in silent grief,

795
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 and you feel like,

796
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 and we had a similar word at 9.15,

797
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 that you're in grief.

798
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 And I think especially as today's Mother's Day

799
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 in the area of like motherhood

800
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 for our ladies out there,

801
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 women out there who are suffering in grief,

802
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 something to do with your role as a mother.

803
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Maybe it's the loss of a child,

804
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 or maybe it's a miscarriage

805
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 or a journey through infertility,

806
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 something like that.

807
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 And you feel the grief of today.

808
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 And so there's that side, you know.

809
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 And others who are just walking in a grief

810
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 that they've been holding,

811
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 that they feel like nobody understands

812
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 and that it's a silly thing to grieve for,

813
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 and that, yeah, I just have to store up my tears

814
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 and hide it from everybody.

815
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 The word of the Scripture says this,

816
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 "Praise to you God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

817
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 "the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,

818
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 "who comforts us all in our troubles,

819
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 "so that we can comfort those who are in any trouble

820
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 "with the comfort ourselves have received from God."

821
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 And one of the blessings of having a bigger church,

822
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 at least in terms of numbers like this,

823
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 is that there are people, I believe,

824
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 who have walked through the path that you are currently going down.

825
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 And there's a community here that are encouraged to comfort

826
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 with the comfort that you've received from Jesus as well.

827
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And so my prayer is that the Word for you is that

828
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 find those people who have walked through

829
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 and find that space where you can share the grief that you're holding

830
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 so that you don't have to--

831
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 you know that you're not in this alone.

832
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 God is there to comfort you.

833
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 But I believe that there's a family,

834
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 the body of Christ who wants to put their arms around you

835
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 and walk with you in this journey as well.

836
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 I feel like the Lord's saying there are maybe many people here

837
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 struggling with a lack of identity.

838
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 You don't know who you are.

839
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 You're trying to figure that out.

840
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 And because you don't know who you are,

841
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 you don't know what you're supposed to do in this world, in this life.

842
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Lack of identity and lack of purpose.

843
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 And this is an invitation to you to come to Him.

844
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 The Father would say to you today, "Come to Me.

845
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 I am the one that put you together in your mother's womb.

846
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 I am the one that wrote down every day of your life

847
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 before one of them came to pass in My books in heaven.

848
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 If you want to know who you are and what you are to do,

849
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 you will find the answers in Me."

850
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 I have the sense that there's someone here, a wife perhaps,

851
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 and you're thinking of leaving your husband.

852
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 And I feel the Lord say there is hope in him.

853
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 He wants to restore your marriage, your family,

854
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 to go to God, seek his hope,

855
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 and also, as Alison shared, speak with others around you.

856
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 Let others in. Let God in. Let others in.

857
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Let God fight for your family and your marriage.

858
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 This is a wisdom of the Holy Spirit by a congregant sharing this morning.

859
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 It's about, yes, you have been chasing a lot of goods.

860
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 Yeah, a lot of good things, good suggestions, good ideas,

861
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 and you kept on fighting for this.

862
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 But what about the right thing I've been calling you to do?

863
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Something that you have to give up your time, give up your efforts,

864
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 even though that may not seem good for everybody,

865
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 but that's the right thing.

866
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 That's the one that I require you to do.

867
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 And would you follow me?

868
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Would you put down the good stuff you think

869
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 and be ready for that?

870
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 I have two things.

871
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 One, somebody here in their left ear, they have a ringing,

872
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 which is causing them not to be able to sleep properly.

873
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 And the other thing I saw was a spotlight shining on somebody,

874
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 and the spotlight suddenly goes off.

875
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 Somebody here, maybe a number of you,

876
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 you've been in the spotlight, you've enjoyed it.

877
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 There's been a season where the light's been shining on you,

878
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 and it's gone dark, and you're wondering why it's gone dark,

879
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 and you're feeling alone, you're missing the spotlight,

880
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 you're missing what it brought to you.

881
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 And the Lord has a word of encouragement to you

882
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 that it's not going to be dark forever.

883
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 He's just changing the light bulb on the spotlight,

884
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 and a different color is about to shine on you.

885
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 It's a new season He's moving into,

886
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 He's stopped the previous season,

887
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 and there's a time of waiting whilst He's changing,

888
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 and He's about to move you into a new season

889
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 with a new light shining on you.

890
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 So when the Holy Spirit gives words, it's not to show off.

891
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 When the Holy Spirit gives words, it's because He longs to act.

892
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 This is what we see at the beginning of Genesis.

893
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 He creates literally by His words.

894
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 He speaks because He wants to act.

895
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 And so if any of those words has connected with any of you in this room,

896
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 it's because He wants to act on you right now.

897
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 He wants to bring that transformation, that new life,

898
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 He wants to take disorder into order, and we want to pray for you.

899
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 So here's what we're going to do.

900
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 We're going to ask you, Upper House, Lower House, Overflow,

901
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 we're going to ask you to be brave if any of those words,

902
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 and we're not going to go at them individually so that there's a bit of anonymity,

903
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 but if any of those words spoke to you,

904
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 we want you to be brave to put your hand in the air right now.

905
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Okay? Just put your hand up in the air nice and high.

906
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 If it's any of those words, Upper House as well, Lower House here,

907
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 Overflow as well, put your hand up in the air nice and high.

908
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 Okay? That's a lot of people with their hands in the air.

909
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Anyone else? All right.

910
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 Okay, so here's what we're going to do now.

911
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 So keep your hand in the air if one of those words spoke to you.

912
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 If your hand's not in the air, you're part of our prayer team right now,

913
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 and you're going to have a chance to pray for the people around you

914
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 with their hands in the air.

915
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Upper House, Lower House, Overflow.

916
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 So keep your hands high.

917
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 Come on, don't be shy.

918
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 If those words spoke to you and you want prayer today, keep the hand up.

919
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Everybody else, why don't you begin to look around right now

920
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 and begin to see if you see somebody with their hand raised near you.

921
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 If their hand is raised near you, that means they would love prayer.

922
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 You can either introduce yourself and ask how to pray for them,

923
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 or you can just start to pray for them.

924
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Just be respectful, maybe a hand on their shoulder, nothing more than that.

925
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 But let's begin to pray for one another. Amen?

926
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 Because when God speaks, it's because He wants to ask.

927
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 So keep your hands up in the air.

928
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 Everybody else, turn around.

929
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Keep praying.

930
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 Lots of people still being prayed for.

931
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 If you're not praying for someone or receiving prayer,

932
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 open your hands.

933
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 I want to just pray over you.

934
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Father, thank you for each person here in this room.

935
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Lord, I want to pray that you would open Scripture to them like never before.

936
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 The Spirit of teaching would fall upon them.

937
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Lord, I pray this week that the Word of God would be more alive

938
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 than it has been at any time in their Christian life.

939
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 And Lord, I want to pray for revelation for those to hear your voice,

940
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 to hear you fresh, to have the deep thoughts of yours revealed by the Spirit,

941
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 spiritual realities by Spirit-taught words, Lord.

942
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 And we pray for this in your name.

943
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Please continue to pray for people if you are.

944
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 If you need to leave, please do so quietly.

945
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 But feel free to stay, receive more prayer.

946
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 We have a prayer team, as always, here at the Vine that's happy to pray for you as well.

947
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 But we'll make our time to pray for you.

948
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Please do leave quietly if you need to leave.

949
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 Otherwise, continue to pray for the people around you

950
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 and allow the Spirit to continue to minister.

951
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Thanks, everyone.

952
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
