1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Amen, thank you Tim and happy Lunar New Year everyone and thank you for having me

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And I hope you are all enjoying the food, the festive decoration everywhere in Hong Kong

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 and family time as well

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And at least you may enjoy the purple colour day I think

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 So, in case you are not familiar with the culture of Lunar New Year

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Hong Kong basically is a big family thing

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 We go out to visit our families and friends

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 We gather and some of my friends would go to Mainland to visit their extended family as well

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 So basically, Lunar New Year in Hong Kong is a huge family festival for us

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 So, for my family, the Yu's family, our tradition is quite relatively simple

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 We do not have many different dinners going on

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 We just have one, like happening on the second day of the New Year, which is today

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And every year we gather on the second year of the New Year

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And as a kid I really enjoyed it

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 When I was young, my mum always prepared new clothes, new shoes for me

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And then I would go over to my grandparents' house in the afternoon

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 And then the adults would be playing mahjong, which they don't have much attention on us

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 So for us as kids, it's perfect for snacks and chocolate

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 So I really enjoyed it

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And then my grandma would be cooking a big meal for everyone

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 So my dad has four siblings, so it's not many, many

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 But if everyone is present, we still get up to 20 people for the dinner

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 So my grandma always cooked for every one of us

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Of course, the licey part is the best part for kids

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 So it was a very happy experience for me as a kid

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 But since I started to grow up, I want to show you a meme

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And perhaps it's universal for family gatherings

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Your relative will start asking you questions you might not be super comfortable to answer

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Like, what school are you in? How's your academic results in school?

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Who is taller among me and my cousins?

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And when I grow up, they will ask me, how much do you earn a month?

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And I'm like, I'm not sure if I want to share that out loud in front of everyone

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So that's the part that I don't fully enjoy as I'm starting to become a teenager, I guess

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And the other thing is, you know, Lunar New Year for us is always happy gatherings

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Families, and we all want happy gatherings

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And there's a saying, you know, Lunar New Year has a lot of rules

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Like, you can't shower or wash your hair on the first day

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And I want to show you one rule that my mom always tells me

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Do not argue with people during CNY

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Because that will give you a whole year of turbulent relationships

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 So you can't really have conflicts during the Lunar New Year

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 But the tension still goes on, right?

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 So as a teenager, when I sit at a table, I start to pick up a little bit of people's facial expressions

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 They might not like each other, or some people will avoid sitting together

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 You can tell every year they're doing that

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 You know what I mean, right?

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So today I will read into the family dynamics with you guys

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 We all want our family to be peaceful, drama-free, and we get to enjoy each other, right?

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 But many of the time, it's not the case

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So if we cannot be excused from this complex situation

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 How do we see God's goodness in the midst of all the tension that's going on around us?

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So actually, the Bible does not shy away from telling us the family dramas

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And we are going to look at Abraham's family today

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So we all know Abraham, who is one of the most important figures in the Bible, right?

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 He's called to be the father of many nations and a blessing to all nations

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And he's also our father in faith as well

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 So as Paul said, everyone who is in faith are descendants of Abraham

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 So he is important to us

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 But I think many of us know Abraham's story

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 So God has a covenant with Abraham that he will bless him with many descendants

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And they will live in a promised land for many, many generations

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And we all know the rest of the story

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 God gave Isaac to Abraham and his wife Sarah

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And then we have a covenant to Isaac and also Jacob and so on

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 As we can tell from Exodus, we see that they are really having many descendants as God promised

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 However, Abraham and his wife Sarah were childless when God gave them the promise

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And he was around 75 years old at that time, which is quite old already

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And they only had Isaac when Abraham was 100

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 So there was a 25 years gap that, oh, we don't have a son

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 So how would God's promise come true if I don't have a son?

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 So I think that period of time might have been giving them a lot of stress

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Especially Sarah as a woman in those days

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 They are quite stressful because she's childless

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 There's a lot of shame, maybe stress going on in her life

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 So she came up with a plan and she decided to give her slave called Hagar to Abraham

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And then they have a child together

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 So that's what happened

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 They have Ishmael

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 But, however, 13 years later, God spoke to Abraham again

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 He said, only the child from you and Sarah will be the promised son

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Oops, so what do we do with the son?

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 But back in those days, not bad to have more children

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 So we will pick up from the story here

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 We will look at Genesis chapter 21 and see how the matter turns out

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 So, Genesis chapter 21, verse 8

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 The child, who is Isaac, grew and was weaned

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 But Sarah saw the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 So she said to Abraham, cast out this slave woman with her son

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 For the son of this slave woman shall not inherit a lot along with my son Isaac

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 The matter was very distressing to Abraham on account of his son

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 So we see here, there is a huge conflict going on in this chosen family because of the sons

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And we can tell that Sarah doesn't seem to be happy with the other son, Ishmael

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And when he was playing with her own son Isaac

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 We are not sure what exactly Ishmael did here

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 But we saw that Sarah seemed to see that son as a threat to her and her son

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And she wanted Abraham to send Hagar and Ishmael away

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 So when we read this, we might wonder

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Isn't that your suggestion for Abraham and Hagar to have a son together?

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Why are you doing this?

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Of course, Sarah's brokenness and her security plays a role here in the story

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 However, when we look deeper into the story

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 We see that there is something more going on within the dynamic of this family

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So when we look back a little bit in chapter 16

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 When Hagar was conceived, the Bible said

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 He went into Hagar and she conceived

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And when she saw that she had conceived

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 She looked with contempt on her mistress

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 So when we look at here, we can tell

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Maybe she is not fully innocent in this family

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Maybe she had done something to trigger a little bit of the tension in the whole family as well

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And for Abraham, if we pay attention to his words and his responses in the whole story

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 We can see that he actually holds a little bit of a passive role in the whole family

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 So when Sarah made a suggestion, he agreed and did that

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 And when Sarah complains about Hagar, looked with contempt on her

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And he told Sarah, "It's your slave, you can do whatever you want with her"

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And now when Sarah asks for expelling Hagar and Ishmael

119
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 His reaction was very distressed

120
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 So we see that even though Abraham is very blessed

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 He is the chosen one by God

122
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 But he is not free from the family dramas and conflicts

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And he can mess things up too, just like you and me

124
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 In this family, Sarah and Abraham might play a bigger role

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 But we see that everyone in this family contributed to the dynamic and conflict

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I think by looking into this story, one thing I do want to note that

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 There is no perfect family

128
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 All families experience conflicts and somehow a level of dysfunction

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Because as Romans said, we are all sinned and fall short of the grace from God

130
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 So I think that's one thing I want to acknowledge together

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 That we are all living in somehow imperfect family as well

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Just not to discourage you, but let's acknowledge that we do mess things up

133
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And we all have a role in our family

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And we are significant in that way by the way how we behave

135
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Or what we say with our family members

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 So no matter what role you are in

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Some of you may be taking a little bit more role as parents or as older siblings

138
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Or you have more responsibilities than others

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Some of you may feel that I have not much to say within my family's matters

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Maybe me as a kid younger, I can't really say anything about my family

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 But I want to encourage you that you are all important to your own family

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Everything you do is contributing in your family

143
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 And also as we are called to be the children of God

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I wonder how does it contribute to us in our family as well

145
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Of course our brokenness, our insecurity like Sarah may contribute to our family

146
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But the good things like as children of God

147
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Our faith, our love, our life that flow out from Jesus

148
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Has an impact in our family as well

149
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So what does it mean to have God in our family?

150
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And how do we involve God in our family as well?

151
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 So let's take a look how God was involved in Abraham's family

152
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Perhaps it will give us some insights and direction

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 So let's pick up from chapter 21, verse 12

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 But God said to Abraham, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and because of your slave woman

155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you

156
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 For it is through Isaac that offspring shall be named for you

157
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 As for the son of the slave woman, I will make a nation of him also

158
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Because he is your offspring

159
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water

160
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 And gave them to Hagar

161
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 She went on her way and wandered in the desert of Beersheba

163
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 So God spoke to Abraham

164
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 The first thing when we pay attention is addressing his emotion

165
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 He saw that Abraham is very distressed

166
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And he also saw the reason behind it

167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Abraham as the father of both sons, Ishmael and Isaac

168
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 It must be very difficult for him to face that situation

169
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Because both of them are his sons

170
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And he loves them and has a responsibility with them as well

171
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 But at the same time, Sarah is his wife whom he loved

172
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And also he has spent most of his life with Sarah as well

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 So now he has to make a decision kind of between his sons and also his wife

174
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 So we can kind of feel his emotion a little bit, right?

175
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 But God sees that and shares how he wants the matter to be resolved

176
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 He commands Abraham to follow Sarah's response to send them away

177
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 We might wonder why would God even agree with that plan

178
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 I'm sure the intention behind is very different

179
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 God never intend to abandon Hagar and Ishmael

180
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Which we can see in the rest of the stories

181
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And I think here he is affirming his promise to Abraham and Sarah

182
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 That Isaac is the promised son

183
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Even though they messed things up, they came up with another plan

184
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And kind of created a problem here that cannot be resolved

185
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 God wants to show his faithfulness by providing a solution to the whole family

186
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 We can tell if things go on and the family stays together

187
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Things might go even worse, right?

188
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 So God here is addressing this problem and showing that

189
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 I still care for your family

190
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Even though you messed up things a little bit

191
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And having something that you kind of deal with

192
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 So we see that God also has a role in this family, in this promised family

193
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 He concerns for each one of them

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And also take care of all members of the family

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 It might seem to us that Hagar and Ishmael are out of the promise

196
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 But God doesn't see that way

197
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 He also cares and helps them when they are wandering in the wilderness

198
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 So this is important for us

199
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 No matter how we are doing in our family

200
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 God is taking care of us

201
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And his grace is enough for us in whatever situations we have

202
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 So after God gave his command

203
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 It is Abraham's turn to make a decision

204
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 As a father, it's hard to choose

205
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And after listening, he might also struggle

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 It's hard to just let his son go

207
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 But we definitely see that as a faith decision

208
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 We don't know what will happen after sending them away

209
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 We don't know whether they will survive

210
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 We don't know whether they can really become a big nation

211
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Because he can't see that

212
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 In those days, sending them away would mean that they will not meet again

213
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So I wonder how he feels when he sends them away

214
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 But I think here, it's not only the faith

215
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Like, we trust God in every way and then we send them away

216
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 It's not like that

217
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 But actually, his action of faith, of sending them away

218
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Is an action of acknowledging God's role in our own family

219
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And put our trust to God that he will take care of them

220
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Even though we don't see how things turn out

221
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And we don't know what's going on in the future

222
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 So I wonder how that speaks to us

223
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 To our personal roles and responsibilities in our family as well

224
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 That in some point, we can't control everything

225
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 We have to let go and let God work among our family members

226
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 To me, I think I really struggle with letting my brother go

227
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 We grew up together until a few years ago

228
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 He told me, "I actually want to move to another country to live in"

229
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 I just want to let you know a little bit of our background

230
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 I'm a super planner

231
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 I'm those who will go to travel with an Excel

232
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 I plan everything ahead

233
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 But my brother is very chill

234
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 He's just like, "Whatever, I'm happy with anything"

235
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 So our personalities are very different

236
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 So when he told me that he wanted to move out

237
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I was like, "Can you survive? You have a good job in Hong Kong

238
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Where are you going? You don't even know where you are going

239
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Do you have a plan? Do you know anyone?"

240
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I asked him so many questions

241
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I'm sure he was annoyed by me, by my questions

242
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Finally, in the end of 2022, he departed to Manchester in the UK

243
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 He was by himself, he's not married

244
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 He's just by himself and he has no friends there

245
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I have some friends there, I wanted to introduce him

246
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 But he rejected me

247
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I'm like, "Are you serious?"

248
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 One night when I was overthinking my overthink

249
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 God spoke to me

250
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 He said, "He's an adult now, actually he's 26 when he moved out

251
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 You're not his mom either

252
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 It's okay that he can live by himself

253
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 He can flourish by himself

254
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 It really spoke to me that night

255
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Why am I overthinking?

256
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 My brother already said he would like to take charge of his life

257
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 He doesn't need my help

258
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Why do I not have peace to just let him flourish in the UK?

259
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 In fact, that's my personality

260
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Because my parents always taught me the responsibilities as an elder kid

261
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I need to take care of my younger brother, my younger cousins

262
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 That's how I grew up

263
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 I worry a lot when my brother is trying to do his own thing and out of my sight

264
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Last year I went with my dad to the UK to visit him

265
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I saw how happy he is

266
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 He told me he planned ahead financially

267
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 That allowed him to have some time, not to rush himself to find a job

268
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 But really think about what he wants to do there

269
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 With his life, with everything

270
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Seeing him that at peace and enjoying his life

271
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Makes me really want to praise God for how he has been

272
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 With him, growing up and also taking care of him in the UK

273
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Even though I can't see, but I know that God takes care of him

274
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 So it was really a very humbling experience

275
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Just to let go of my control on my brother

276
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And see how he can flourish there

277
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 I know each one of you might have different parts

278
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Maybe not as a sibling

279
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 But there are a lot of things that we want to take care of

280
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 We think that's our responsibility

281
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Because this is how we are taught to be

282
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 But I wonder if there's anything you would like to just let go

283
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And submit that to God and allow him to intervene

284
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And take care of the rest of your families

285
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 So I wonder how the things can be different with God's intervention

286
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Let's go back to Abraham's story a little bit

287
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 The change, I don't know whether you are aware of where the change comes from

288
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 You have been doing your own thing

289
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And having Ishmael for a few years already

290
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 But God can only intervene when Sarah voices out something is wrong

291
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 So at the start of the story we see that

292
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Sarah saw how the two boys were playing together

293
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 And she thinks something is wrong here

294
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And she voices out to Abraham

295
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And then after that God starts to speak to Abraham on this matter

296
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 We see that, as I mentioned before, Abraham took a relatively passive role

297
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And we can see that he doesn't want to send the boys away

298
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Because he might not see that as a problem

299
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 But we can only resolve a problem when you acknowledge there is one

300
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 If you don't want to acknowledge it, nothing will be changed

301
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 So Abraham's position is not new to us

302
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I want to address something, particularly in our culture

303
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 In Chinese culture, there are a lot of people who like to avoid conflict

304
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Many of us have huge conflict avoidance

305
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 We want to maintain the harmony at home and keep everyone together

306
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 But the harmony on the surface is not exactly what we want

307
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 We do not have peace just having harmony on the surface

308
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 And seeing the tension, like my family's tension on the table

309
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 It's not true peace, right?

310
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 And also we like to greet each other with blessings in the beginning of the year

311
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 That's a good thing to do, but let's not settle with that

312
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Let's not just settle with saying some blessings

313
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 But actually be a blessing to the people around us

314
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 So I wonder how we can actually be a blessing in our family

315
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 When there are things that we might not be able to control

316
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 I want to share a story with you, I struggle with that

317
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 But I feel I want to share with you today

318
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 My family is not, I struggle with my family basically

319
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 My parents are divorced, and before they divorced

320
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 They took a really long time with a lot of conflicts at home

321
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 I know you might not expect this in Chinese New Year

322
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 But anyway, I'll just share

323
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 So one night, they were having a really intense fight with each other

324
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 My brother and I were sharing a room at that time

325
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And then we overheard their fight

326
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And then we were not sure what to do in the room

327
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 So as I said, my brother is a huge conflict avoidant

328
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And he was like, "Oh, I can't deal with that"

329
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And then he also said, "I'm not sure whether you can deal with that as well"

330
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Because I have always been the firecracker at home

331
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 I make troubles and I stir things up

332
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 And then I was like, "Yeah, maybe let's wait"

333
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 But it takes so long, it's like until 1am, it's not resolved yet

334
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And I'm like, I prayed and I have peace

335
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And I go out and talk to my parents

336
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And then what I did was just simply calming them down

337
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I said, "You need to calm down right now"

338
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 And it's 1am in the morning and we're not heading anywhere

339
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And I don't know what will happen

340
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 That's all, and then I try to talk to them

341
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And they calm themselves down

342
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And decide to have a discussion later when they are calmer

343
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 So, that's the case, I didn't do anything

344
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 But the next day, my dad spoke to me

345
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 I am the only Christian at home

346
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And my dad spoke to me

347
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 And he always be a little bit unsure whether he likes me as a Christian

348
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Because he just doesn't believe that

349
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 And don't know what I'm doing in church

350
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I'm always in church

351
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 But he spoke to me that morning and said

352
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 "Now I see how God works in your life"

353
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And you were never that calm in conflicts

354
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 But you did that very well last night

355
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 And so I wonder, in the midst of our family dynamics

356
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 In the midst of different things going on in our family

357
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 How do we be the one that stands in front of God

358
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 And be the person that can minister God's goodness in our family

359
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 So I know that it's uneasy to do that

360
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 It's uneasy for me to do that as well

361
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 As we attend to the bigger gathering

362
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 There's too many things going on

363
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 But I wonder how we can do that

364
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 I want to encourage you with what Paul says to us

365
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 He describes us as God's temple

366
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And the Holy Spirit dwells in us

367
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 That means people actually can meet God through us

368
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Because we are God's temple

369
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 In the past, people can only go to the temple to pray to God

370
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 To ask the priest to have sacrifice

371
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And now, since Jesus Christ has come

372
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And gave us the Holy Spirit

373
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 We are the temple

374
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And people see God through us

375
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 So as we are

376
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Probably many of you will be going to family gatherings

377
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I want to encourage you that

378
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 There's a significance in you

379
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And because God is in you

380
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 So I don't know how you can do that

381
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 You might feel I'm not that significant in my household

382
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And I don't have much to say

383
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 But God does not look contempt on you

384
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 He sees your role

385
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 He sees that you are important to your family

386
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 As your family members will see him through you

387
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 So

388
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 I would like to pray for us

389
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 So can I invite you to stand?

390
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Let's start with a little bit of reflections on ourselves

391
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Let's think about what role do we hold in our family

392
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 What relationship do we have?

393
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 How are we doing with interacting with the people?

394
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 No matter what's going on

395
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 We know that God is with us

396
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 He sees our situation

397
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 He sees those unspoken things

398
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Even though we might not want to acknowledge

399
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Thank you

400
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Holy Spirit we want to invite you to be with us in our family

401
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 We acknowledge that we are imperfect

402
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 We mess things up

403
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 But your grace is enough

404
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 May you reveal to us

405
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Is there any area we need your help on?

406
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 We don't necessarily need to

407
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 We solve everything by ourselves

408
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 But you are the father of our household as well

409
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 So may you speak to us and allow us to see

410
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 What we can bring your love and your grace to our family

411
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Perhaps some of us notice something is wrong

412
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And we are unsure how to say about it

413
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 I pray that your wisdom and your strength is in us

414
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 May you give us strength

415
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Give us the words on how to communicate with our family

416
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 With love, with patience

417
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Some of us may be avoiding some difficult decisions or conversations

418
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 God we pray that you will guide us

419
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 And allow us to have the courage to bring you to our family

420
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 To bring you perhaps some of the solutions to our family as well

421
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 So Lord, we need you because we are imperfect

422
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 We don't know everything

423
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 We don't know how to handle every situation that we are going through

424
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 So Lord, we pray that you will come with us

425
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Perhaps some of us feel that we are nobody in our family

426
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 We can't really decide or contribute

427
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 But we know that in you we are not like that

428
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 We are important, we are significant as your children

429
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 So Lord, may your goodness flow out from us

430
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 May you use us in our family

431
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 To extend the real blessings to the people around us

432
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 As we gather, we pray that your goodness, your love, your faith will go with us

433
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 And you will minister to the people around us

434
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 To those who don't know you yet through us

435
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 So Lord, may we be your temple

436
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 May you show your goodness to the people around us, to our family

437
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Help us and be with us

438
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 We pray in Jesus name

439
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Amen

440
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Thank you

441
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Why don't we sing and declare this together
