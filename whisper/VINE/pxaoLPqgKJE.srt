1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Why don't you have a seat, why don't you have a seat.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,480
 And I want to start today by asking you a question.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,960
 And it's a really honest question.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,080
 And the question is this, I wonder if you've ever felt hopeful for like really serious

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,160
 positive change in your life and then things just got worse.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,840
 Anyone ever experienced that?

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,240
 Where you were really hopeful for positive change to happen in your life and things just

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,140
 kind of got worse rather than better?

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,880
 Have you ever felt an experience where God has spoken a word to you?

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,600
 Where God said something into your spirit or confirmed something in you and you felt

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
 the rush of the wind of the spirit and you know you're about to move into something that

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,740
 God has promised for you and there's an excitement that builds up in you and perhaps you've even

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,280
 taken that first tentative little step of faith knowing that because God is saying it,

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,960
 because God is in it, because God is for it, you know that it's going to go well and as

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,520
 you step out in faith, it actually ends up being worse than what life was like before

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,360
 God had even given you the word in the first place.

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,880
 Anyone ever felt like that?

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
 Just me.

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:24,760
 Have you ever felt like God fans something into flame and as soon as you step forward

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,000
 in faith, the flame just died?

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,200
 Back in the spring of 2006, God spoke a word to me that was perhaps one of the most life-changing

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,040
 things He's ever said to me.

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,320
 The word was this.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,480
 God said, "Andrew, it's time to build a family."

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,440
 And it's hard to describe to you the literally life-changing events that took place because

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,800
 God has spoken those words to me.

27
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,040
 I don't know if I've ever heard the audible voice of God, but this was a time in my life

28
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,280
 where I had never felt a word so sure, a word so real, a word that released a wind of the

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,480
 Spirit in me like nothing before.

30
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 "Andrew, it's time to build a family."

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,040
 My wife and I got married early.

32
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,040
 I was 16, she was 15.

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
 Just kidding, just kidding.

34
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,560
 It wasn't like that at all.

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,760
 Some of you here, like, you're a guest today.

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,520
 Somebody invited you to church.

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,880
 You're like, "What?"

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
 But we did get married young.

39
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,460
 I was 23, she was 22.

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,600
 Now my wife's from a culture where people often get married young and when they get

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,480
 married young, they usually start to have kids young.

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,400
 And usually by about the age of 25, the family has kids already.

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,880
 The first child comes into the world at about the age of 25.

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,240
 I grew up in Hong Kong.

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,680
 I come from a very different culture to my wife.

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,240
 In Hong Kong, you have to have a big successful career first before you have kids, right?

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,320
 Like things take a lot longer in Hong Kong.

48
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,760
 People don't generally have kids at a young age.

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,960
 It usually happens when you get into your 30s and you've kind of lived a life and things

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,960
 have happened and maybe you've had some success and now you're ready to settle down and have

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
 kids.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,360
 So my culture and my wife's culture, very different.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,640
 And so we get married 23, 22 and Chris is like, "Woohoo, time for kids."

54
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,280
 And I was like, "Woohoo, no."

55
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
 Because I wanted to enjoy my life.

56
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,920
 I wanted to enjoy my wife.

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,720
 I wanted to go and see the world and do things together and have great dreams and enjoy life

58
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,440
 without the inconvenience of little kids around all over the place.

59
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,920
 I didn't want to be shackled down.

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,200
 I wanted to be free.

61
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,720
 So my wife and I, soon after we got married, had a conversation.

62
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,600
 My conversation read, "Argument."

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,280
 And she was like, "But I want to have kids.

64
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
 I'm excited for kids."

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,960
 We talked about having kids and we had actually talked about having kids before we got married,

66
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
 my bad.

67
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,320
 And I said, "But I'm not ready, honey.

68
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
 We can't do it.

69
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
 I'm not ready.

70
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
 I don't feel ready."

71
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
 And so I said, "No."

72
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,840
 And this conversation would come up every year.

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,720
 Every year we'd get to the end of the year and Chris would be like, "Are you ready now?"

74
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,040
 And I'd be like, "No.

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
 I'm not ready.

76
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
 I don't want to do this.

77
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
 I don't feel equipped.

78
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,640
 I don't feel like this is my time.

79
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,520
 I feel like we've still got more time together and I don't want to get shackled down."

80
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,920
 And I was going through all of this.

81
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,360
 And throughout the years of my 20s, she kept on going, "Now?"

82
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,800
 I kept on going, "No."

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,960
 We got to the end of our 20s.

84
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
 I turned 30.

85
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,920
 And Chris is like, "Man, it's been eight years.

86
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,480
 We've been married for a long time now.

87
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
 And what's going on?

88
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,080
 When is this ever going to happen?"

89
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,600
 And we were in New Zealand at this time.

90
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,320
 And I remember the exact moment.

91
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,600
 I'm sitting in a chair and I'm staring out through this beautiful large window at a beautiful

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,400
 New Zealand park, green everywhere.

93
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,600
 And there's this family, husband, wife, and one child.

94
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,300
 And they're pushing their child on the swing set in this park.

95
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,760
 And as I looked upon that, I almost heard the audible voice of God.

96
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,960
 "Andrew, it's time to build a family."

97
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,720
 And I can't begin to describe the 180 that happened in my spirit in a single moment.

98
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,480
 Before that moment, I would look out on those people in the park and I'd be like, "Man,

99
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
 that's tough.

100
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,840
 You know, bless them, but that's not what I want."

101
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,680
 And literally within just that phrase from God, I felt my spirit completely change.

102
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,080
 I felt the rush of the wind of the Spirit in me like perhaps I've never felt before.

103
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,840
 And I knew that this was our time.

104
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,280
 I knew that God had ordained this time that God was calling us into perhaps the greatest

105
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,420
 journey and adventure my wife and I would ever have.

106
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,920
 We would start to build a family together.

107
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,840
 And I remember looking out on this family and I remember almost seeing Chris and I standing

108
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,160
 in this park pushing a child together.

109
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,240
 And I longed for that moment.

110
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,840
 I longed to be a father like I had never longed before.

111
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,600
 It was just this instant change in my life.

112
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,120
 I remember sharing with Chris, "Hey, Chris, I feel like God's given me a word today and

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
 I'm ready.

114
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
 Let's go.

115
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
 Like this is happening."

116
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,320
 And she starts crying and she's so excited.

117
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,120
 She's been so long suffering, waiting for me to get to the place where I'm finally there.

118
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,520
 And together we're so filled with joy because God had spoken.

119
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,880
 And when God speaks, things happen.

120
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,320
 Amen?

121
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,840
 Amen.

122
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,400
 Yeah.

123
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,400
 I told this story many times over the years.

124
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,080
 If you've been here at the Vine, you'll know what happened next.

125
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,700
 God did not roll out the red carpet of fertility for Chris and I.

126
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,840
 In fact, we tried for around about a year.

127
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,320
 And at the end of the year, we realized that this was not happening like we thought it

128
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
 was going to happen.

129
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:55,560
 We had the question, "Did God really say that it was time?"

130
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,240
 And we entered into a time of tests.

131
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,920
 I figured my wife, there's lots of things that could go wrong in that area.

132
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,360
 With a guy, it's only one thing.

133
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,920
 So I kind of like thought the issue would be with her.

134
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,280
 But we very quickly discovered that the issue was with me.

135
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,280
 And that entered us into another year of procedures, of tests that culminated in a surgery to discover

136
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,100
 whether I was biologically able to father children or not.

137
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,060
 And at the end of that one surgery, the next week we were called into the doctor's office

138
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,360
 at the fertility clinic that we were a part of.

139
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,120
 And Chris and I sat down together holding each other's hands, looking across the desk

140
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,520
 at this doctor white coat clipboard.

141
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,160
 And he turns to me and he says these words.

142
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,000
 These were his exact words.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,760
 He says, "Andrew, you will never be a father."

144
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,280
 I want you to sit into the contrast of the paradox of these two words about a year and

145
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
 a bit apart.

146
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,240
 "Andrew, it's time to build a family."

147
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,760
 "Andrew, you will never be a father."

148
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,280
 And I remember thinking to myself, what is going on here?

149
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,400
 Because more than anything in my life, I knew that God had spoken.

150
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,680
 I had never felt the rush of the wind of the spirit like that and ever before.

151
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,920
 I knew that God was in this.

152
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,520
 I knew that this was our time.

153
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,940
 And suddenly things have gotten a lot worse than better.

154
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,020
 In fact, our marriage was better before God had given me that picture of that family and

155
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,240
 God had given me that word.

156
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,160
 We had now just gone through all of this pain, all of this hurt, all of this frustration,

157
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,880
 and I was angry.

158
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,480
 And I wonder whether this resonates with any of you here today.

159
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,400
 Like when you see these two things here, maybe for you it's not that exact issue, but you

160
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,640
 know a time in your life where you felt like God say something and you took that step out

161
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,480
 and things did not go how you thought.

162
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,520
 In fact, it got worse rather than better.

163
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,960
 I remember writing in my journal something super honest.

164
00:08:50,960 --> 00:09:02,160
 I wrote this, "How can you call me into freedom and then take me into more slavery?"

165
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,520
 I was wrestling with this idea.

166
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:15,400
 How can you, God, call me into great freedom, but then bring me into a place of deeper slavery?

167
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:23,040
 That question and the paradox that it creates is exactly what we see happen next in our

168
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,400
 Exodus journey.

169
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,360
 We're entering into chapter five today, and I want to tell you this.

170
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,980
 Chapter five is one of the hardest chapters in the whole of the journey.

171
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,360
 Chapter five is the moment where Israel have looked out that window and seen that swing

172
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,680
 set and gone, "God is for us."

173
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,680
 And then nothing happens quite how they were expecting it to happen.

174
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,800
 In fact, things get a lot worse before they get better.

175
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,080
 And perhaps some of you today, you're in a situation where your life feels like it's

176
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,200
 worse than it's ever been before.

177
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,480
 Perhaps things have happened or things are going on for you right now where you're wrestling

178
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,360
 with those deep questions, "Where is God in this?

179
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,080
 I thought God was for me, and if God's for me, then who can be against me, but this is

180
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,240
 my reality."

181
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,280
 And you're sitting in the reality of what you're struggling with.

182
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,000
 Perhaps during this series of Exodus, you've enjoyed the series and you're excited because

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,480
 you believe that God is calling you out of a slavery.

184
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,920
 You believe that God has spoken to you over the last six, seven weeks, and there is something

185
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,520
 that you're trying to exit from.

186
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,920
 There's something that you're trying to depart from, an exodus for yourself, and you're excited

187
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,360
 about it, and you're really looking forward to it, and you know that God is for you and

188
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,520
 God's going to do great things.

189
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,440
 I want to just say something right up front that I think is really important to understand

190
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,840
 about the whole journey and the book of Exodus itself, and it's this.

191
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,920
 Just because God calls us to freedom doesn't mean that the journey is going to be a pain-free

192
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
 one.

193
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
 Come on, church.

194
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,080
 And I know this is not going to be easy, but I want to present to you the heart of what

195
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,360
 Scripture reveals to us.

196
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,840
 Just because God might be calling us to freedom doesn't mean that the journey is not going

197
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,160
 to be a pain-free one.

198
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,680
 It doesn't mean that suddenly we're going to be questioned from all the bad stuff.

199
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,440
 It doesn't mean that perhaps we're going to have to go to even deeper places of our brokenness

200
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,900
 and our darkness before we might see the journey of freedom that God has, that maybe there's

201
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,000
 a first thing that needs to happen.

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,920
 Because one thing you've got to understand that when you're on any journey of deliverance,

203
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,720
 any journey of freedom, the darkness always fights back.

204
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,040
 The darkness always tries to fight back.

205
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,680
 And if the Exodus story tells us anything, it tells us this, that the journey of deliverance

206
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,040
 is always a journey that has highs and lows, a journey of great mountain peaks and dark

207
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,460
 valleys, a journey, yes, where there's straight moments and straight paths, but also a journey

208
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:02,040
 where things wind and twist and you wonder whether it will ever end.

209
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:11,080
 And I'm so grateful that the sobering reality of deliverance is that it is not pain-free

210
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,120
 and that the Bible does not shy away from it.

211
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,040
 And I want to show you how it doesn't shy away from it here.

212
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,920
 And I want to open this up to you with that pastoral heart that we've been talking about.

213
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,480
 Because I believe that there is some real nuggets of wisdom for you this afternoon,

214
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,640
 if you resonate at all with the kind of thing that I've already been sharing with you.

215
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,640
 I want to show you the contrast that happens between chapter four and chapter five.

216
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,800
 John did a fantastic job last week with chapter four, as he showed you the signs that happen,

217
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,440
 that God gives Moses, throwing down the stick and becoming a snake, the leprosy in the jacket

218
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
 and that kind of thing.

219
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,800
 Those signs were a revelation that God was at work, that God was here to fight on behalf

220
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
 of His people.

221
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,380
 And at the end of chapter four, you get this climax moment where the people of Israel begin

222
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,840
 to believe that God is going to deliver them.

223
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,760
 I want to read to you just the final few verses of chapter four.

224
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,960
 "Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites, and Aaron told them

225
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,600
 everything that the Lord had said to Moses.

226
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,620
 He also performed the signs before the people, and they believed."

227
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,680
 They saw the signs and they believed.

228
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,220
 They believed that their God was come.

229
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,480
 They believed that their God cared for them, that their God was compassionate, that their

230
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,120
 God was going to deliver them.

231
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,600
 "And when they heard that the Lord was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they

232
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,720
 bowed down and worshipped."

233
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,120
 I mean, what a moment.

234
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,920
 The whole of Israel realizing that their 430 years of being trapped in Egypt is about to

235
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,160
 be released.

236
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,160
 The whole of Israel understanding that God is now here for them, fighting battles for

237
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,200
 them, that their God is concerned for them.

238
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,300
 And so they fall down and they worship Him.

239
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,080
 This is everything that God had asked, that He was going to deliver them so that they

240
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,760
 might be free to worship Him.

241
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,080
 Right here, before anything else, they start to worship.

242
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,320
 And you can almost sense the faith that's in the camp of Israel in this moment.

243
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,080
 The sense that God is here now for them.

244
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,440
 And it's off the back of this faith and this confidence that Moses and Aaron now go to

245
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
 Pharaoh to confront him and ask him to let his people go.

246
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,640
 And you can understand that Moses and Aaron are in this moment of great joy.

247
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,280
 They're in this moment of great confidence and faith.

248
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,520
 And you can understand that they're expecting that if God is for us, who can be against

249
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,840
 us?

250
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,560
 And so in that confidence, they stand before God.

251
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,920
 And notice chapter 5, verse 1 onwards.

252
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,920
 "Afterwards," so after this amazing moment on this mountaintop experience of worshipping

253
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,760
 God, "Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said this, 'This is what the Lord, the God

254
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:53,680
 of Israel, says, 'Let my people go so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert.'"

255
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,920
 Pharaoh said, "Who is the Lord that I should obey Him and let Israel go?

256
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,520
 I do not know this Lord and I will not let Israel go."

257
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,400
 Not quite what Moses and Aaron were expecting.

258
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,760
 They then said to Pharaoh, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us.

259
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,120
 Now let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our

260
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,600
 God, or He may strike us with plagues or with the sword.

261
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,280
 But the king of Egypt," that's Pharaoh again, "Pharaoh says, 'Moses and Aaron, why are

262
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,240
 you taking the people away from their labor?

263
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,840
 Get back to work.'

264
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,120
 Then Pharaoh said, 'Look, the people of this land are now numerous and you are stopping

265
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,760
 them from working.'"

266
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,720
 Notice this, "That same day, Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and the foremen

267
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,880
 in charge of the people.

268
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,360
 You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks.

269
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,080
 Let them go and gather their own straw, but require them to make the same number of bricks

270
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
 as before.

271
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,120
 Don't reduce the quota for they are lazy."

272
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,360
 And this is why they are crying up and going, "Let us go and sacrifice to our God."

273
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,080
 Make them work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to

274
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,460
 the lives.

275
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,920
 This was not expected.

276
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,680
 They were expecting, "Hey, let us go."

277
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
 "Oh, okay, sure.

278
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,400
 Yeah, you can go."

279
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:23,400
 And God is at work here, but this is not how people expected things to happen.

280
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,640
 It has gotten not just normal, but worse than before.

281
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,680
 Notice this, that there is now slavery taking place at a level that it had never happened

282
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
 before.

283
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,400
 There's an oppression that's happening at a level never before.

284
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,440
 Pharaoh takes the straw away from the Israelites.

285
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,800
 The straw was an essential component to making these bricks that they had to make.

286
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
 It held them and bound them together.

287
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,800
 He removes it from them and tells them that they still need to make the same quota of

288
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,080
 the same quality bricks as before, which meant that the Israelites had to go source the straw

289
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,000
 themselves in order to try to make these bricks.

290
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,440
 If they made bricks without straw, they wouldn't be strong enough to hold anything.

291
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,240
 This is an incredibly difficult thing.

292
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,480
 And they're in this moment where they're like, "Hang on.

293
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,840
 This is not the way things were supposed to go."

294
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,360
 Because God had said, "Now's the time to build a family."

295
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,520
 And then I discover I'm infertile?

296
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,720
 Hang on a sec.

297
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,400
 What's really going on here?

298
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,480
 This so upsets, in fact, the leaders of Israel.

299
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,520
 They go before Pharaoh later in the chapter, and they say to Pharaoh, "Hang on.

300
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,160
 You must have got this wrong, right?

301
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,840
 Why are you making it harder for us?

302
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,260
 We're already your slaves.

303
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,280
 Now you're actually making it harder for us."

304
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,440
 And Pharaoh's response is, "You're lazy.

305
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,760
 I'm not going to let these people go so they can worship some God that I don't believe

306
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
 in or know.

307
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
 I'm not going to do that.

308
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,280
 In fact, you're going to work harder."

309
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,040
 And then he beats them up.

310
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,360
 So not only are they slaves, now they're having to make bricks without straw.

311
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,900
 Now they're being beaten up.

312
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,640
 This is getting really bad.

313
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,220
 And understandably, God's leaders, these leaders of Israel, turn and come to Moses

314
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,220
 and Aaron.

315
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,280
 And I want to read you what it says at the end of this chapter as they speak to Moses

316
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
 and Aaron.

317
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
 This is verse 20.

318
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,060
 "When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them.

319
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,800
 And they said, 'May the Lord look upon you and judge you.

320
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,060
 You have made us a stench to Pharaoh and his officials, and they have put a sword in their

321
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,660
 hands to kill us.'"

322
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,940
 The leaders of Israel come before Moses and Aaron, where just before they're all worshipping

323
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,980
 up on a mountain, believing God and thinking it's all going to be great.

324
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,540
 Now they come before Moses and Aaron and they say, "We hope that God judges you."

325
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,340
 In other words, they put a curse on them.

326
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,940
 And they say, "We've become a stench before Pharaoh."

327
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,500
 And I wonder if you could see what's happening here.

328
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,900
 They're looking for someone to blame.

329
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,020
 And the people that they're going to blame is the leader that's in front of them.

330
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,300
 The ones that had caused them to believe that good things were going to happen.

331
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:06,740
 I want you to know, it is not easy to be a spiritual leader of a group of people.

332
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:15,940
 Church, it's not easy to be a spiritual leader of a group of people.

333
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,260
 And over the years, man, you guys are lovely, I love you dearly, but over the years, pass

334
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,300
 around you, "Why did you do this?

335
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,060
 Why did this happen?

336
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,180
 You said this would go on.

337
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,060
 You prayed for me, but it didn't get better.

338
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,700
 It got worse.

339
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:34,060
 You put a curse on me."

340
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,900
 And when you see this heart that we have so often when things don't go our way, who is

341
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,860
 it that we can blame?

342
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,500
 Notice what Moses and Aaron do off the back of this, verses 22 to 23.

343
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,020
 Moses returns to the Lord and says, "Oh Lord, why have you brought trouble upon this people?

344
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,620
 Is this why you sent me?

345
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,380
 Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought more trouble upon his

346
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,820
 people and you have not rescued your people at all."

347
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,940
 Moses goes before God and cries out honestly before him and he says, "God, what are you

348
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,500
 doing?

349
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,940
 Because I thought you were in this.

350
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,100
 I thought you said build a family, but this is not happening now.

351
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,940
 Like every time I try to do this, it's just getting worse.

352
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,420
 Why have you not rescued your people?"

353
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,500
 These are honest, true, and real words from Moses.

354
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,460
 And I'm so grateful that we have this passage in Scripture because it means that we can

355
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,980
 come before God with some of these words that we have, with some of this anger and frustration

356
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,980
 in life.

357
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,700
 I mean, if I'm honest with you, I could so easily rewrite this passage myself.

358
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,820
 "Andrew returned to the Lord and said, 'Why, oh Lord, have you brought this trouble on

359
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,820
 me?

360
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,540
 Why did you give me the excitement to build a family to only make me incapable of doing

361
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540
 so?

362
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,100
 Ever since I stepped out in your name, you have brought me nothing but trouble and you

363
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,380
 have not delivered on your promise at all.'"

364
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:57,860
 I wonder if you might have something similar yourself, where you would find yourself at

365
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,500
 times coming before God and saying, "Why?

366
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,300
 This is not right."

367
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,620
 Perhaps you felt God has released you into something like I did that time and it hasn't

368
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,900
 worked out the way you thought it was going to work out.

369
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,700
 Perhaps for some of you in here, God said, "Hey, I'm going to make your marriage better

370
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,740
 and your marriage has just gotten worse."

371
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,220
 Maybe for some of you in here, it's your finances and you thought your finances would turn around

372
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,380
 and you've been praying for your finances, but you've just seen your bank account get

373
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,960
 lower and lower and lower.

374
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,500
 Maybe for some of you here, it's a sickness that you're carrying, a disease that you can't

375
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,860
 seem to shake and, oh, you've been praying and your friends have been praying and everybody's

376
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,700
 been praying, but it just seems to be getting worse rather than it's getting better.

377
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,660
 Or maybe there's some sin or some brokenness in your life and you've genuinely brought

378
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,800
 it before God and you've asked Him to forgive you and you felt God's forgiveness, but you're

379
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,940
 more tempted than you've ever been before.

380
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:58,020
 Why is it that sometimes it gets worse before it gets better?

381
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:04,060
 How do we reconcile this reality with a good God?

382
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,500
 It's one of the most fundamental questions of our scriptures and one of the most fundamental

383
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,900
 things that is happening right here in chapter 5 of the Exodus journey.

384
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:18,940
 How do we reconcile this paradox that is so often before us in our Christian lives?

385
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,500
 Well, the last thing I'm going to do today is give you some glib answer.

386
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,100
 I mean, it would be great if I could stand before you and go, "Oh, okay, here's the one

387
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,740
 prayer that you can pray that's going to sort your whole life out.

388
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,780
 If you just pray this prayer in three easy steps, every problem you've ever had will

389
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,860
 go away for the rest of your life."

390
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,180
 Like I wish that could happen.

391
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,780
 I wish I had a theological magic wand to teach you something or tell you something that's

392
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,340
 going to immediately change your perspective on every bad thing that's ever happened in

393
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,340
 your life and everything's going to be great again.

394
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:53,860
 I'm not going to stand in front of you today and give you some glib answer.

395
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:59,420
 I have to say, during my infertility journey, although I was surrounded by really good-meaning

396
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:06,540
 people and people that had a great heart, I got a lot of glib answers to my problems.

397
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,380
 And I wonder whether you've ever experienced something like that.

398
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,060
 It seemed to me when I was going through my infertility journey that everybody had the

399
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,860
 answer except for me.

400
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,980
 I felt like everybody knew exactly what I needed to do to change myself so that I could

401
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,900
 suddenly produce kids all over the place.

402
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,260
 "Oh, Pastor Andrew, prayer of Jabez is the prayer to pray.

403
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,180
 You just pray the prayer of Jabez, everything will be fine."

404
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,900
 Or perhaps here at the Vine, it was more like this, "Andrew, there are Chinese herbs and

405
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,660
 medicines that you can have that will totally change your life.

406
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,620
 Are you with me, church?"

407
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,220
 Everybody seemed to have a solution except me.

408
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,300
 Everybody seemed to have an attitude towards what I needed to do to suddenly make myself

409
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
 better.

410
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,780
 And I want to be honest about it, some of those things were more painful and hurtful

411
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,620
 to me than my actual infertility journey.

412
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,980
 And so I'm not going to give you some answer today.

413
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,100
 What I want to do though is invite you into Moses' journey in this chapter.

414
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,780
 And I want to share two specific things about what happens for Moses.

415
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:21,820
 And I want to share them again, not as answers, but as invitations to reflection, invitations

416
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,380
 for you to reflect a little bit deeper about the things that are happening in your life

417
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,180
 and your relationship with God.

418
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,580
 Does that sound okay?

419
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,820
 Here's the first thing.

420
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,500
 Moses falsely accuses God.

421
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,940
 And I think this actually opens up for us a deep reflection around so much of what we

422
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,380
 do as humans when life doesn't seem to match up to what we thought about what God was going

423
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,380
 to do.

424
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:56,740
 You see, we so often accuse God for not being concerned or compassionate towards us.

425
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,420
 That's one of the primary things that happens when we're going through a moment like this

426
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,540
 in life.

427
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,780
 We suddenly accuse God of not having enough love, not having enough compassion, not being

428
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,740
 concerned enough about us.

429
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,740
 And when we do that, we're doing that because of this.

430
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,140
 We're doing that because we're allowing our circumstances to define how much compassion

431
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,460
 and love we think God has.

432
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,980
 I did this throughout my infertility journey.

433
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,700
 There were many times where I looked at the situation I was in and I allowed that to define

434
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:33,420
 for me how much concern or love that I thought God had for me.

435
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,020
 Because if God had this kind of love, surely it wouldn't be like this.

436
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:44,660
 And I was allowing my circumstances to define God rather than God define my circumstances.

437
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,860
 Are you with me?

438
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,820
 And this is the first thing that Moses is doing here.

439
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,060
 He comes before God and he's like, "Why have you not come through?

440
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,260
 Why have you not delivered?

441
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,620
 Why have you not rescued the people?"

442
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,940
 Now this is really interesting because just two weeks prior to this, in the burning bush,

443
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,940
 Moses is like, "I don't want to go."

444
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,620
 Moses has no compassion at all.

445
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,060
 "I don't want to go.

446
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,420
 I'm happy here in the desert.

447
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,900
 I've got a new family.

448
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
 Everything's great.

449
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,780
 Why would I go back to the place of my greatest brokenness?"

450
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,740
 And God reveals something to him.

451
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,140
 "I'm a God of compassion.

452
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,660
 I'm a God who is so compassionate that I look down upon my people and I see them in their

453
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,020
 slavery and it's moved me and now I've come and called you to go back to Egypt."

454
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,660
 God defines himself the first time that he meets Moses as a God of compassion.

455
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,500
 Two weeks later, Moses is pointing the finger at God.

456
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,740
 Where's your compassion?

457
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,860
 Are you not compassionate?

458
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,580
 And this is really dangerous because here's where this takes us as human beings.

459
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:48,220
 It's dangerous for us to begin to think that we have more love and more compassion than

460
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,660
 God himself.

461
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,100
 That's what happens in this kind of journey.

462
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,300
 We begin to think that we are the ones who are actually more compassionate and more loving

463
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,580
 than God.

464
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,260
 And because we begin to think that way, we begin to take our circumstances into our hands.

465
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,820
 "Oh, I'm going to fix it."

466
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,620
 "Well, if you're not going to do it, if you're not loving, well then I guess I'll try and

467
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,140
 do it myself."

468
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,740
 And we suddenly place ourselves in the perspective of God and we become gods in our minds.

469
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,300
 This is idolatry and pride.

470
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:24,340
 And Moses is pointing the finger at God and saying, "You're not doing all this stuff."

471
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,700
 And I think that's a place that I know I get to.

472
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:36,020
 And I need a deeper reflection around how I allow my circumstances to define God rather

473
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,260
 than God give me a perspective on my circumstances.

474
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:47,260
 That's the journey that Moses has to go through between this chapter and the next about 20

475
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,060
 or 12 chapters.

476
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:57,180
 I think it's a journey that all of us at times in our lives have to go on.

477
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,380
 Here's the second thing that takes place for Moses.

478
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,660
 And this is like mind-blowing.

479
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:07,340
 At the one and the same time that Moses is basically throwing a whole bunch of blame

480
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,340
 at God, God is actually at work in Moses.

481
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:18,180
 See, our God is so loving, so compassionate, and so kind that in the very same moment that

482
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:25,180
 Moses is essentially lashing out at God for not having enough compassion, God is actually

483
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,820
 working on Moses' heart to give him more compassion.

484
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,620
 And in a human thinking, we think like, "I would never do that.

485
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,180
 This is God."

486
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,740
 And God's like, "Right now I'm actually forming and shaping you in Moses the very compassion

487
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,960
 that you're going to need for the journey that's ahead of you.

488
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,180
 Right now as you're in the place where you think things are getting a lot worse before

489
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,280
 they're getting better, and it is actually a lot worse than it was just a week ago for

490
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,540
 your people, I'm actually doing something in you that is forming and shaping and forging

491
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,720
 in you the kind of compassion you're going to need to be the true leader of my people."

492
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,740
 Because Moses has already gotten a lot more compassion than just two weeks previously

493
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,700
 when God had met him at a burning bush.

494
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,580
 He's already got more compassion, but he hasn't got the kind of compassion yet that God is

495
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,740
 seeking for him to have, because Moses is still pointing fingers and blaming God for

496
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,160
 how God's not seeming to act.

497
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,520
 And what you're going to see later on in the story of Exodus is in the moments when it

498
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,700
 feels like God is not going to act or God isn't doing what Moses thinks, Moses doesn't

499
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,540
 point his finger and blame God anymore.

500
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,760
 Here's what Moses says.

501
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:37,020
 He says, "God, you are merciful and compassionate, and I believe that you are all these things,

502
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,940
 and I will not go forward.

503
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,420
 We will not take another step forward unless you go with us."

504
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:50,500
 See, something changes in Moses' heart from a, "Why are you not delivering us?" to a,

505
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:58,020
 "We will not do anything without you, because you are a merciful, loving, compassionate

506
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
 God."

507
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,860
 There is a change that happens in Moses that forms a love and compassion in him that would

508
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:12,960
 never be there unless it's been forged in the fire of when things get worse before they

509
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,900
 get better.

510
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:24,980
 God is doing something in Moses here that is so deeply profound, shaping him through

511
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:30,660
 great disappointment, through the rejection of his own people, and through his own anger

512
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:39,300
 and frustration that is creating in him something that could never be there without it.

513
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,820
 Now, I've told you my story of my infertility hundreds of times over the last...if you've

514
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,500
 been at the Vine for the last 10 years, you're sick of hearing that story.

515
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,460
 I get it.

516
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:56,140
 But up until now, you have never heard my wife tell you that story, to tell you her

517
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,500
 perspective on that story.

518
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:04,300
 And in many ways, my wife is the perfect echo of everything that happens in chapter 5 for

519
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,700
 Moses.

520
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,740
 My wife lives the same journey that Moses lives.

521
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,300
 My wife waiting for years and years and years for breakthrough and for hope that things

522
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,580
 will change.

523
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,600
 And then her husband comes to her and says, "Yes, things are changing.

524
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
 It's time to start."

525
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,900
 And my wife, in tears of joy that she now gets to move into a phase of her life that

526
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:29,500
 she's been long suffering for, and then to discover that there is more long suffering

527
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,100
 to come, in fact, some suffering that neither of us ever experienced.

528
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,420
 My wife having to wrestle through the anger and the frustration, through all of the realities

529
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,940
 of the fact that it's gotten worse than it was before.

530
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,780
 And then in that, my wife having to wrestle with some of the biggest questions about her

531
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,860
 womanhood, what it means to be a woman and carry a child.

532
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,220
 What it means to be a mother.

533
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,360
 And having to wrestle through some of the deepest pains and fears that she has.

534
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:09,980
 And in that, find herself forging a new perspective that would never have been in her unless that

535
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,540
 journey had taken place.

536
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,640
 I want to invite my wife now to share this story with you.

537
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,580
 What you're going to see on this film is raw.

538
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,860
 It's really vulnerable for her to do this, particularly to do this for everybody over

539
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,220
 all these services and for the internet and everybody that can see it.

540
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:33,380
 But I want you to lean in and open your heart to her side of the story.

541
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:39,460
 And I pray that you might be able to see a glimpse of Moses' story in her.

542
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,460
 Let's have a look.

543
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,460
 - You all good?

544
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460
 - Yeah, good.

545
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,460
 Thank you.

546
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,460
 - Would you like to introduce yourself a little bit?

547
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,460
 - Sure.

548
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,460
 - Okay.

549
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,460
 - So, I'm going to introduce myself.

550
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,260
 - Would you like to introduce yourself a little bit?

551
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,260
 - Yeah.

552
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,260
 I'm Christine.

553
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,980
 I'm Andrew's wife.

554
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:06,460
 And I'm going to have a chat with you about our journey of how our family grew, our infertility.

555
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,540
 I think we started talking about having children quite young.

556
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,540
 We were quite young.

557
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,260
 And that conversation lasted for a long time.

558
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:24,780
 And then kind of when we were ready to have children, we couldn't.

559
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,380
 We thought that we would get pregnant quite quickly.

560
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:33,020
 I suppose a lot of people think that, and it does take time.

561
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:41,660
 So after a couple of years, we started to get some blood tests and different procedures

562
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,980
 done to see if there was an issue.

563
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:53,380
 And we discovered that there was an issue and that it was primarily with Andrew.

564
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:59,020
 So he had to go through a number of other tests to see what exactly was going on, where

565
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,900
 the problem exactly was.

566
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,500
 So it took quite a while.

567
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,140
 We saw a number of specialists.

568
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:13,780
 Yeah, there were a lot of emotions, mainly, I think for me, mainly around frustration.

569
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,860
 Frustration that we didn't start the process sooner.

570
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,700
 And I have to admit that I was like, well, I wanted to start it sooner.

571
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,020
 So the fact that it's happening all now, and it's taken such a long time, and we're getting

572
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:37,220
 older and older, I suppose I kind of put that at Andrew's feet that my frustration is his

573
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,140
 fault in a way.

574
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:48,500
 And then just sadness, anxiety around what things were going to look like, particularly

575
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,660
 for me, anxiety around how Andrew is doing.

576
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:59,900
 Because I could see that it's really hard to see other people struggle, right?

577
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,660
 So I can kind of deal with my own struggles, and I usually keep that pretty private.

578
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,860
 But when you're seeing another person in pain and struggling with questions, it's quite

579
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,860
 difficult.

580
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,820
 When you want to move into the next life stage, and it's difficult, and you see everyone else

581
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:26,900
 doing it, it's kind of a bit, what's the feeling?

582
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,220
 It's a bit lonely.

583
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,180
 You can feel a bit lonely.

584
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:39,980
 I think that loneliness, that fear of being lonely and kind of being left behind, I get

585
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,300
 angry.

586
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:52,780
 So I tend to, I do withdraw myself from the people that I'm angry with.

587
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:57,300
 And then I feel guilty that I'm withdrawing.

588
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,700
 And then I'm going in that whole loop of, well, if this is about a fear of being lonely,

589
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:06,700
 I'm causing myself to be lonely through withdrawing.

590
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,740
 So I think for people around me, for friends, it might have been a little bit confusing

591
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,740
 sometimes.

592
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:19,300
 But of course, they were really good, and they just let me feel the way I felt.

593
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,840
 So that was an impact.

594
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:28,500
 So I do remember there was a time where I decided to go out for a walk on my own.

595
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:35,100
 When I'm on my own, I can then think about my own feelings, because nobody else is around

596
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,420
 for me to be attending to.

597
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:47,460
 And that was when I was thinking about not carrying a child.

598
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:54,740
 Because if we couldn't have children biologically, I wouldn't be carrying a child.

599
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:12,260
 I was thinking about having a child in your womb, and all the experiences that I'll be

600
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
 missing out on.

601
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:23,140
 And I felt a loss, because right from an early age, little girls are given prams to push

602
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:28,220
 and babies to care for, and you play house and all that kind of stuff.

603
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,780
 And society is like, this is the way that you grow a family.

604
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:44,820
 So I felt sadness, I felt loss, I felt grief that I wouldn't know any of those experiences.

605
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:53,300
 I think when I processed through the life, not being able to carry this life and grow

606
00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:04,540
 this life inside of me, which was sad, disappointing, grief, and then thinking about a life that

607
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:11,420
 is already present in this world, and we have such an ability to impact that life.

608
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:19,220
 I started thinking about life and how these children who are available for adoption have

609
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:28,460
 already entered into this world, they've already got life, and their life before them is a

610
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,180
 blank slate.

611
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:38,780
 And it's dependent not on what they choose, but on other people making these big choices,

612
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:45,460
 which is going to affect their life in such a phenomenal way.

613
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:55,620
 And I felt a great love for that, that Andrew and I could make a decision that will impact

614
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:00,500
 a life that is already here in such a powerful way.

615
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:09,340
 I felt, because there's a person right, we have a child now, and that's my child, I don't

616
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,820
 want another child.

617
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,100
 Even if I went back to that place, knowing what I know now, I'd be even more like, I

618
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,460
 don't want a care, I want this child.

619
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:41,820
 Not long ago I was thinking, you know, I'm disappointed, I feel a loss that I haven't

620
00:39:41,820 --> 00:40:05,220
 been able to carry my child.

621
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:12,100
 And it will always be there, I'm sure as she gets older, every stage of life, you know.

622
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:17,020
 I don't know, there's something that comes through, carrying a child, and I really miss

623
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:30,380
 that I wasn't able to carry my child.

624
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:37,220
 It's amazing to me that out of a place of my wife's greatest pain, for not being able

625
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:47,580
 to carry a child, God would forge a love in her for Mia that would be so huge, that now

626
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:52,740
 her sense of loss is not having carried Mia in her womb.

627
00:40:52,740 --> 00:41:02,340
 That her bond as a mother to Mia is so strong that that's now where she feels the loss.

628
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:09,740
 And Moses goes through this moment where he's wondering, what is God doing here?

629
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:13,980
 This is getting worse than we had ever imagined.

630
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:22,700
 God is forging in Moses a love that perhaps could not be found in him in any other way,

631
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:29,420
 but would be the very thing that would enable him to lead his people to the promised land.

632
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:34,220
 The same thing is happening for you, and whatever it is that you're struggling with, whatever

633
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,820
 journey it is that you are on, whatever brokenness it is that you might be carrying.

634
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:45,940
 So you have to understand that God's economy is different from the world's economy, and

635
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:56,140
 that in God's economy, conflict often precedes triumph, that suffering often precedes victory,

636
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:03,420
 that suffering does not mean that God is not faithful, that God sometimes allows his people

637
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,100
 to make bricks without straw.

638
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:14,220
 Your greatest moments of freedom will happen when you allow God to take you to the places

639
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,620
 of your greatest fears and brokenness.

640
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:27,700
 You see, the deliverance of God is never cheap, and when it is cheap, we so quickly forget

641
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,700
 it.

642
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:35,540
 But when we realize that there is a journey that he brings to us that is not guaranteed

643
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:42,500
 to be pain-free, but where the pain can forge in us something of him, never be able to be

644
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:52,100
 found in any other way, perhaps then we cry out, "Maranatha, come Lord Jesus."

645
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,620
 I believe that's actually what the Exodus is all about.

646
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,860
 Can I pray for you?

647
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,420
 Let's pray.

648
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:10,380
 Father, I'm so grateful for each person here, and I'm grateful for this pastoral moment

649
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:19,540
 to be together, and for us to bring ourselves raw before you with whatever it is that is

650
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:25,380
 overwhelming us in this time of our lives.

651
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,740
 Just like we heard today, there are no easy answers.

652
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,500
 There are no perfect prayers.

653
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:44,060
 Lord, we look into Moses' life and we see a man that we can connect to emotionally,

654
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:50,740
 because we've had some of those same frustrations, and we've carried some of those same questions.

655
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:57,380
 And Lord, we thank you for Chris and for her willingness to vulnerably share her story

656
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:09,020
 with us, and where we can see how things did get worse before they got better for her.

657
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:13,780
 And it was out of that time that you forged a love in her that ultimately would bring

658
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,660
 both Chris and myself to our daughter Mia.

659
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:23,500
 Father, I pray for each person here, for their journey, for wherever it is that they are

660
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,380
 on that journey.

661
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:33,380
 Lord, I pray for us as a church in our Exodus, that Lord, if you need to take us to places

662
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:41,020
 where we have to face some of these fears, where we have to wrestle sometimes with the

663
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:44,180
 brokenness at a level that is not easy.

664
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:49,380
 Lord, I would pray that you would help us to go there.

665
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:58,140
 Father, you're delivering us, and we're thankful that in the book of Exodus we can see the

666
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:02,300
 challenge that there is in such a journey.

667
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:07,580
 We know that the enemy will fight back, and we know that sometimes it gets worse before

668
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,420
 it gets better.

669
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:16,360
 But in the book of Exodus, we also have the way in which we see God work in the midst

670
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:22,100
 of human affairs, in the midst of human brokenness.

671
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:29,780
 We see a God who is compassionate, who is loving, who is the fullness of mercy, and

672
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,340
 who works in us and through us no matter where we are in life.

673
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,180
 And Father, I just really release that over people here.

674
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:43,340
 I want to encourage you, if this is an important word for you to, I want to just encourage

675
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:47,940
 you whilst our eyes are closed, just to open your hands before you.

676
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:54,420
 That simple posture of humility and surrender to Him is a way of saying, "Lord, would you

677
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,380
 come and meet me right here?"

678
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,300
 I don't have the answers, Lord.

679
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,860
 I don't know quite what's going on.

680
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,540
 I'm trying to trust you, but this is hard.

681
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:17,140
 As you open your hands, you're just coming before Him.

682
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:27,620
 And I believe He will meet you in profound ways, perhaps ways that you never would expect.

683
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:36,100
 And I believe He is forging and shaping in you.

684
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:40,340
 The person who's always longed and seen in you.

685
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:48,380
 And that life, that picture of the girl with the merry-go-round, that life is for you.

686
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:55,620
 And there's nothing that the enemy can do to stop you from the fullness of the life

687
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,900
 that God has for you.

688
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,940
 Father, would you come?

689
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,980
 Would you come and pastor your church, Lord?

690
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:16,620
 Would you come and pastor your people, Lord?

691
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:30,220
 Come Lord Jesus, come.

692
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:37,420
 Perhaps as you're just in this place, and maybe you're not sure how to pray, I'm just

693
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:43,620
 going to invite in a moment the team to just sing over you.

694
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:51,220
 Maybe the lyrics and the melody is your prayer.

695
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:56,140
 As God is forming and shaping something in you in this moment, you don't need to rush

696
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,820
 this moment.

697
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:05,740
 Allow His love and His compassion to be with you.

698
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,260
 Amen.

699
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,840
