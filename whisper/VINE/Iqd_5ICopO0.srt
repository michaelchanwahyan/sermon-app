1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 No one likes waiting.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,400
 I was in the MTR last week at Thim Sa Chui.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,800
 I ran down the escalator to get my train to Central.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:22,000
 I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the platform sign.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,400
 The train will arrive

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
 in four minutes.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,400
 Aiyah!

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,400
 Four minutes!

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:48,600
 But what about the 400 silent years?

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,400
 The time between the last writings of the Old Testament

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,400
 and the appearance of Christ is known as the Intertestamental Period

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,400
 or Between the Testaments.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,400
 It lasted from the prophet Malachi about 400 BC

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,400
 to the ministry of John the Baptist

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,400
 whose birth we look forward to today as we kick off our Advent series, Surprising Joy.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:33,400
 Because there was no prophetic word from God during the period from Malachi to John,

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,800
 some refer to it as the 400 silent years.

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:49,200
 To set the scene, I want to read a couple of verses from Luke chapter 1.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,600
 Verse 13, "But the angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid, Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard.

20
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:06,000
 Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.'"

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Good name, that one.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,600
 Verse 63, "Zechariah asked for a writing tablet."

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
 No iPads in those days.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 "And to everyone's astonishment, he wrote this.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,400
 His name is John."

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,400
 His name is John.

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
 Now the story of Zechariah and Elizabeth is quite personal to me.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,000
 My father was 51 years of old when I was born.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And I was actually his firstborn.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,600
 My mom had been widowed.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,400
 Could you imagine the excitement of having your first child at that age?

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,600
 My father's name was John Henry Snellgrove, to be precise.

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:11,000
 But I was born on the 23rd of April, which in the UK is known as St. George's Day, our patron saint.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So my mom decided to call me George.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 But dad had other ideas and promptly went out to register me, I guess after a celebration drink or three.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 You guessed it, he said, "His name is John."

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 John Henry Snellgrove, Jr. made his entry into the world.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And by the way, no calling me George after the service.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Anyway, let's get back to the sermon.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I think sometimes in church, in our sermons, we are guilty of what I call verse picking.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Reading only verses that suit our sermon story.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 But today in our Advent series, and Chapman has already told us about the first coming and the second coming of Jesus,

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 we ask ourselves three questions.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 The first one is this, what does Advent mean?

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And the answer is coming.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Who is coming?

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Jesus.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 What are we to do?

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Get ready.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 So as part of getting ready, I'm going to read the whole passage, 21 verses in one go.

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I'm reading from Luke chapter 1, starting from verse 5.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 In the time of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah,

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 His wife, Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commands and decrees blamelessly.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 But they were childless, because Elizabeth was not able to conceive.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And they were both very old.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Once, when Zechariah's division was on duty, and he was serving as a priest before God,

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 he was chosen by Lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple and to burn the incense.

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshippers were praying outside.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Then, I love that word, an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 He will be a joy and a delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth.

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or any other fermented drink.

67
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah,

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 to turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the disobedience to the wisdom of the righteous,

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 and to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."

72
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Zechariah asked the angel, "How can this be? I'm an old man, and my wife, well, she's well along in years."

73
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 The angel said to him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God,

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 and I have been sent to speak to you and tell you this good news.

75
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens,

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 because you do not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time."

77
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 When he came out, he could not speak to them.

79
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs,

80
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 but remained unable to speak.

81
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 When his time of service was completed, he went home.

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 After this, his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.

83
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 "The Lord has done this for me," she said.

84
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 "In these days, he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace amongst the people."

85
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 So quite a long passage, and there are three key themes in this passage.

86
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 The first theme is Zechariah and Elizabeth's long years of barrenness.

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 We can assume that Elizabeth and Zechariah are well past childbearing age.

88
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 We're not told their exact age, or John's birth would not have been considered a miracle.

89
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 We are told in verse 7, "But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive,

90
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 and they were very old."

91
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Anecdotally, they would probably be in their 60s, and if they were in Hong Kong,

92
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 they would qualify for a Joy-U card and pay $2 for travel.

93
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 The second theme, the key theme, is the silence of God after centuries of prophetic absence.

94
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I've already described it, the 400 silent years.

95
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 The announcement of John's birth breaks the silence, bringing unexpected joy.

96
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Not only for Elizabeth and Zechariah, but also for Israel.

97
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 This leads me to ask ourselves,

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 have you ever experienced a significant desert season in your life?

99
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Let me repeat it.

100
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Have you ever experienced a significant desert season in your life?

101
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I've chatted to a few people recently who have described to me a long season of doubt,

102
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 confusion, spiritual dryness, or a long season of waiting for God to come.

103
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 A long season of waiting for something that they long for in their life.

104
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Using my MTR analogy, most of us don't even like the experience of short waits.

105
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 If you've ever been to McDonald's, you go in and you go, "What's the shortest queue?"

106
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 "Can I get in the shortest queue?"

107
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 "Oh good, that you've actually got in the shortest queue until the guy in front of you orders 14 Big Mac meals."

108
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I read that collectively people spend about 67 billion hours a year waiting in lines.

109
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And even this small task can be a test of our patience most days.

110
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Even in the short waits, the feeling of uncertainty about their end,

111
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 and the feeling of it being unfair, like the guy with the 14 Big Mac meals, makes us struggle.

112
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 But then there are experiences in life that involve not just minutes, but months, and even years of waiting.

113
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 It can feel like a desert, or like barrenness.

114
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 This kind of waiting doesn't just test our patience, it tests our hope.

115
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 As pastors, Sandra and I have walked with countless couples wrestling with childlessness.

116
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 It's so hard, especially those who are desperate to have a family of their own.

117
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 But barrenness can take many forms.

118
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 It can look like eight dryness in your life, a loss, loneliness, rejection.

119
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 It can be some relationship not yet reconciled, or something you've been asking God to do in your marriage or in your singleness.

120
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 It can look like a pain or injustice you've endured, and are asking for healing and restoration.

121
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Or some, and I know this is many of us, struggle like depression.

122
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 You keep asking God to do something.

123
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 God, do something new!

124
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 But the change hasn't come yet.

125
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 For many of us, the waiting changes us.

126
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And yet somehow, some of us are able to keep our hearts alive in the barren places.

127
00:13:46,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Zechariah and Elizabeth were among a people who had experienced a lifetime waiting in desert circumstances.

128
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 The nation of Israel was waiting for the promised Messiah.

129
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And Zechariah and Elizabeth, who were very old and barren, were longing for a child.

130
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Their story shows us two ways of responding when God shows up in those dry, hopeless places in our lives.

131
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 One is skeptical.

132
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 The other is full of wonder.

133
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And we ask the question, what is the difference between them?

134
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 How can we keep our hearts soft and hopeful so we don't miss God when He shows up?

135
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 I wonder, for Zechariah, if maybe the experience of God with him in his waiting wasn't personal for him anymore.

136
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 I can't imagine what it was like for him.

137
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 All the years, all the years of asking for a child.

138
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 The waiting, the possible stigma of unfaithfulness that others would have felt towards them.

139
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Oh, God hasn't blessed you because you're not faithful enough.

140
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Even though they had lived incredibly faithful lives.

141
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 My friends, waiting without answers and without an end in sight can be excruciating.

142
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 I think of some of our Asylum Seeker friends here at the Vine.

143
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 I was speaking at the Arise Fellowship last week and I noticed some of them who've been with us for up to 15 years

144
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 without their case getting settled and, to be honest, nowhere near their case being settled.

145
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 In a foreign country, no access to an ID card and limited benefits and even more limited prospects.

146
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Waiting is so difficult and often the waiting changes us.

147
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Maybe Zechariah had changed somehow in the waiting.

148
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 He clearly kept going through the motions. He was faithful in his duty.

149
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 He continued to pray for the redemption of Israel and to believe that God would send Messiah.

150
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 But, maybe he'd lost hope that God would show up in his own personal desert.

151
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 So, when God shows up in, I have to say, an incredibly theatrical encounter to get his attention

152
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 and give this personal announcement that he would indeed have a son.

153
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 At first, Zechariah misses what God is doing.

154
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 I don't know if you know, but there were nearly 18,000 priests who were each on duty two weeks a year.

155
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 They cast lots to see who would burn the incense and offer prayers.

156
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 If you get chosen, you can never do it again.

157
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 It's a once in a lifetime opportunity and some people would never get chosen.

158
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Let's read what happened as Zechariah gets chosen.

159
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Verse 8.

160
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 What we're going to see is while he is there performing this holy, ancient service for Israel,

161
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 an angel of the Lord shows up to tell him he's going to have a son.

162
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Then the angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.

163
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and gripped with fear.

164
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard.

165
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Elizabeth will bear you a son and you are called him John."

166
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 God shows up and Zechariah, you can see it, can't you? He's wondering, "How can I be sure?"

167
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 He says this, "How can I be sure of this? I'm an old man.

168
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 My wife is getting on a bit as well. Went along in years."

169
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 He's scepticism. He has everything he needs to believe that God could do a great thing for him.

170
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Firstly, he's a priest. He holds the stories of God's faithfulness to others like Abraham and Sarah.

171
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 He has the stories of his own life and this supernatural encounter.

172
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It's pretty statistically reliable evidence that if an angel shows up and says that God is going to do a thing, God's going to do that thing.

173
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 But what he experiences is scepticism.

174
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 It's almost like he stopped believing that God will do anything like this for him.

175
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 It's not personal anymore.

176
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Maybe under all of our struggling with the deserts of our lives is this fear.

177
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 This loss of faith.

178
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 "Oh, we can believe that God's going to come through for other people."

179
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 But maybe not just for us anymore.

180
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 On the other hand, Elizabeth responds differently.

181
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 She hears the news in a very different way.

182
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Possibly just her old, mute husband scribbling a note to her or making hand gestures.

183
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 She probably also notices a few changes in her body.

184
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 But there were no sonograms or ultrasound.

185
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 There was no way to be certain.

186
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 She could have thought she was crazy or maybe just ill.

187
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 But somehow she believed not only that God could do such a thing,

188
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 she believed He would do such a thing for her.

189
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Can you see that?

190
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 It's one thing to believe that God could do it.

191
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Another thing, that God will do it for me.

192
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And she said this, verse 25, I'll put it on the screen.

193
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 "The Lord has done this for me."

194
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 It's personal to her.

195
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 It's not just about the redemption of Israel.

196
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 But it is also about God showing up in a very personal way for her and Zechariah.

197
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 It has a feeling of intimate worship as we read how she stays in seclusion for five months.

198
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 And then later when Mary visits her, a song of worship pours out of her heart.

199
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 But it leads us to the question, what about us?

200
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 What about us?

201
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 The story of Elizabeth and Zechariah makes me wonder,

202
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 how can we keep our hearts soft and hopeful when we encounter deserts in our life?

203
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 What are a few ways we can keep our life with God personal?

204
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 I want to suggest a couple of things.

205
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Number one in this Thanksgiving week, remember and be thankful.

206
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 It helps to remember ways He has shown up for us before and for those around us.

207
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Being thankful is a way of acknowledging His active work around us

208
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 and reminds our hearts that He is not far away.

209
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Passively watching our lives evolve.

210
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 He is close and He is acting on behalf of those He loves.

211
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 To be honest, if I had unlimited time today, I would go around the congregation

212
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 and ask you all to say one thing that you are thankful for.

213
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Maybe just think about that now.

214
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 What are you thankful for?

215
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Remember it and be thankful. That's number one.

216
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Number two, nurture an intimate friendship with God.

217
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Everyone does this differently.

218
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 But any relationship requires time and presence,

219
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 listening and learning in order to grow.

220
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Reading or listening to scripture, praying,

221
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 learning to listen to the voice of God,

222
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 finding ways to glimpse how good and just how faithful God is

223
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 often leads to worship because it's our natural response to be in awe

224
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 and we are reminded of God's greatness and His love.

225
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And the third one is be around spiritual family.

226
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 When the desert is hard and testing our hope,

227
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 we need people in our life who will remind us

228
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 that God still knows our name.

229
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 He still sees our life and that He will come through to us.

230
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 If you're not in a community group or a small group, get in one now.

231
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Be around spiritual family.

232
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 We may not get to encounter with an angel,

233
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 but Jesus is always showing up in our lives.

234
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And if Jesus is always personal for us,

235
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 we can find flourishing even in the desert.

236
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Let me finish with an illustration.

237
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 There are parts of the Atacama Desert in Chile

238
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 where no rain has ever been recorded.

239
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Scientists believe that portions of the region

240
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 have been in extreme desert state for 40 million years,

241
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 longer than any other place on earth.

242
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And yet, more than 1 million people live in the Atacama currently.

243
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Farmers have found ways to extract enough water

244
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 from underground water supplies and snow melt streams

245
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 to grow crops and raise llamas and alpacas.

246
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 In 2015, a portion of the desert received a historic rainfall,

247
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 just under one inch of rain in one day.

248
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 It may not seem very much,

249
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 particularly those of us who come from England,

250
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 but it was the equivalent of 14 years of rainfall

251
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 for this region all in one day.

252
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And this desert that had already found a way

253
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 to thrive and sustain more than 1 million people

254
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 was now also covered in a beautiful layer

255
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 of pink and purple bloom after the rain.

256
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Let's look at the picture.

257
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 My friends, this is a picture of your life.

258
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Yeah, take it. Share it. Post and tag. Go on.

259
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 This is in the driest place on the whole earth.

260
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 What a picture.

261
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 My friends, the message of this Advent

262
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 is that Jesus has come to take away the barrenness of the world.

263
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 He can make us flourish and bring beauty

264
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 even in the deserted places of our lives.

265
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 If you are in a season of waiting,

266
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 how is the waiting changing you?

267
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Maybe today, yes, today,

268
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Jesus wants to renew your hope

269
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 that he is showing up in the barren places of your life.

270
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 As I ask the band to come up,

271
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 I'm going to ask you just to close your eyes for a moment.

272
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 (Pause)

273
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 We're going to pray now as a church

274
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 for anyone here who is waiting.

275
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 I suspect it's many of us.

276
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Maybe you're like Zechariah and Elizabeth.

277
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 You're a couple waiting for a baby,

278
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 waiting to get pregnant.

279
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 It hasn't happened.

280
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Maybe you're waiting for that relationship.

281
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 When is God going to bring that person into my life

282
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 that will allow me to walk through life with?

283
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Maybe you're waiting for a job or a job opportunity.

284
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Maybe you're waiting for a time

285
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 just to get out of the depression you're in.

286
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 You've got that sort of mood around you

287
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 and it's around you the whole time.

288
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 How long is this going to go on for, Lord?

289
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 When am I going to see joy again?

290
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Whatever it is, if you're waiting today,

291
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 we're going to pray for you.

292
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Keep your eyes closed for a moment.

293
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 If you're waiting for something, whatever it is,

294
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 just put your hands up and we're going to pray for you.

295
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 If you're waiting for something.

296
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 (Pause)

297
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Just open your eyes, everyone.

298
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Keep your hands up.

299
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 If you're around these people, just go and lay hands on them.

300
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 It's not too late.

301
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 People who have got their hands up, can you just go around?

302
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 This is not me praying for everybody.

303
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 This is not the way we do church.

304
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 The church prays for the church.

305
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Find a person with their hands up.

306
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 There are people all over the place.

307
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Please look.

308
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 If you haven't got your hands up, go and pray for someone.

309
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 (Pause)

310
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Come on, guys, I need you to be part of this.

311
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 (Pause)

312
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 If you're waiting, I'm not going to ask you what you're waiting for.

313
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 It'll be different for each one of us.

314
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 There's a lady at the back waiting.

315
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Some people at the back waiting, can people go and pray for them?

316
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 (Pause)

317
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Come on, this is part of us growing as a church, growing as a family.

318
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 When we see people in our family struggling with something,

319
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 to go and reach out to them.

320
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Just reach out your hands to them.

321
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 You don't have to pray the most wonderful prayer.

322
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 But just lay your hands.

323
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Just say, "I care.

324
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 You're my family.

325
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Divine, you and Long.

326
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 We're building a family here."

327
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And if you're waiting, we're waiting with you.

328
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 We believe that God is going to come through.

329
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
