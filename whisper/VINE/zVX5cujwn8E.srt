1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
 Amen.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,320
 Okay, so if you've been here in the last couple of weeks,

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,640
 you know we just wrapped up our sermon series on healing

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,280
 and we're starting a brand new sermon series

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,760
 and I'm gonna introduce the speaker of today

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,360
 and he will come and tell us about that.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,360
 Let's put our hands together and welcome Pastor Tim.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,840
 (audience applauding)

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,440
 Who else is gonna start a new sermon series, right?

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,040
 Why don't we stretch out our hands and pray for him?

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,840
 Father, we just pray for your anointing

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,360
 and your presence on Tim today.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,500
 This word, this actually, this whole sermon series

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,420
 that you have put on his heart,

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,600
 you have something you wanna share with us

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,080
 through him today.

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,320
 And so God, I pray you will anoint not just him,

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,860
 but also our ears, you will anoint our hearts

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,080
 to receive this message that you wanna bring to this church

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,040
 so that we could be your people,

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,960
 ready to do your work in this area.

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
 In Jesus' name we pray.

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,800
 - Amen. - Amen.

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,840
 Thank you Chapman.

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,120
 I don't know if you have ever found yourself

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,480
 in a place where you are lost,

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,360
 where you are just lost.

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
 Now I know I have.

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,040
 When I was a young adult,

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,380
 I had just graduated from university, I started working.

31
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,780
 And during that time, my company,

32
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,200
 they moved me to a location where I didn't know anyone.

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,040
 And so without community, without that support,

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,720
 I started making choices that were just not good.

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,120
 I didn't have the right priorities in my life

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,520
 and I just started drifting.

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,360
 And I wasn't being the person that I wanted to be,

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,760
 not in the very least.

39
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,440
 I knew I wasn't who I wanted to be.

40
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,240
 I don't know, have you ever felt that way?

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,680
 You're like, I'm not who I wanna be.

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,000
 I know God has something better for me.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,400
 And I knew that.

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,700
 And so that was the circumstance there.

45
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,400
 So what do you do as a Christian

46
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,280
 when you find yourself in a place

47
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,020
 where you are losing your way?

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,040
 How do you find your way back

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,440
 into the life that God intends for you?

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,200
 How do you get back on track?

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,920
 Now perhaps some of you are feeling this way right now,

52
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,360
 that you have been in one way or another losing your way.

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,360
 Maybe you just have been losing that passion for Jesus.

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,120
 Like you used to be excited to come and to worship

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,280
 and spend time in Jesus' presence,

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,180
 but now suddenly that's not the same anymore.

57
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,840
 Maybe you've gotten off track wandering

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,120
 because you have other priorities.

59
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,680
 Jesus somehow moved away from the center of your life

60
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,440
 and suddenly there's other things

61
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,680
 that are absorbing your time, your heart,

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,640
 your thinking, your imagination.

63
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,560
 And you weren't even aware that it was happening

64
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,560
 and suddenly you find yourself in this place

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,280
 where your faith is really not playing a role

66
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,280
 or much of a role in your life anymore.

67
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,660
 Now I have good news for you.

68
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,200
 I think we all at one point or another

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,720
 can relate to this experience

70
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,200
 and we go through these different seasons,

71
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,000
 but today we're gonna start a sermon series,

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
 11 weeks through the book of Galatians.

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,040
 And in that, we're gonna see how God invites us

74
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,540
 to get back on track and align ourselves with Jesus again.

75
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,560
 And so that's this process that we're gonna go through.

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,300
 Now I wanna introduce to you the book of Galatians,

77
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,600
 give you a little bit background information

78
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,160
 and also say a little bit about

79
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,480
 why are we going through the book,

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,320
 a little bit more about

81
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,480
 why are we going through this book in this season.

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,520
 So the first thing is,

83
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,900
 Galatian Christians, they were also losing their way.

84
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,680
 They were losing their faith.

85
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,880
 They were not on the right track.

86
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,960
 Paul had, the apostle Paul had founded the church.

87
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,480
 He planted it, it's interesting, he was actually sick.

88
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,580
 So him being sick led to him ministering to people

89
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,840
 which then started the church.

90
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,180
 I love how God works.

91
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,100
 It wasn't planned, but God worked

92
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,700
 and established that church.

93
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,380
 And so after some time, after these churches were settled,

94
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,460
 he moved on, continued his work,

95
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,500
 his calling from God of proclaiming the gospel

96
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,980
 and planting new churches.

97
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,100
 But then there was a group of people

98
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,040
 that followed after Paul.

99
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,440
 And people call them different names.

100
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,300
 Sometimes they call them Judaizers.

101
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,460
 Sometimes they call them rival missionaries.

102
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,420
 Paul himself refers to them as agitators

103
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,160
 in the letter of Galatians.

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,700
 Now, what was going on?

105
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,720
 What was happening?

106
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,000
 Well, they came in after Paul

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,340
 and they said that Paul didn't give them

108
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,660
 the full gospel message.

109
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,500
 He only shared half of it with them.

110
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,300
 And basically, they also questioned his apostleship.

111
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,820
 They're like, he's just a second-rate apostle.

112
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,060
 And so let us share with you the full gospel.

113
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,260
 That's what they were saying.

114
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,400
 And so then they added to what Jesus has done.

115
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,900
 They added circumcision and observance of the Mosaic law.

116
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,700
 Now, just imagine that for a moment.

117
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,260
 Picture yourself in a company.

118
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,340
 Maybe you had a role.

119
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,300
 You set up the department.

120
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,900
 You get everything running in the way,

121
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,980
 systems, that everything is running smoothly and good.

122
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,740
 And then now you get a promotion.

123
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,660
 You move on to a different department.

124
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,140
 Somebody comes in after you.

125
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,220
 And then suddenly you start hearing rumors

126
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,180
 that this person's saying that everything that you did

127
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,140
 was not a good approach.

128
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,940
 And they start undoing all the work that you did.

129
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,140
 And as you're hearing about this,

130
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,660
 you're like, man, just whatever this person's doing,

131
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,620
 they're bringing this department to disaster.

132
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,060
 I mean, that's what Paul must have felt

133
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,060
 as he heard about these reports

134
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,820
 about these rival missionaries

135
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,460
 really deceiving and misleading the people.

136
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,940
 And so what Paul does, he decides to write a letter.

137
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,100
 And to defend himself as an apostle,

138
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,460
 to defend this gospel, and to get the wandering Galatians

139
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,660
 who are starting to believe what these rival missionaries

140
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,380
 are saying, to get them back on track.

141
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,340
 And so what Paul does,

142
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,020
 he goes back to the basics of the gospel.

143
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,060
 And he casts for them the vision that God has for them

144
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,700
 of how they can live in the fullness of the life

145
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,860
 that God has for them,

146
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,300
 that God wants to see unfold in their lives.

147
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,820
 And so he brings them back to the basic things

148
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,380
 so that they can be aligned and be set right again

149
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,140
 and move from being wandering

150
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,700
 to now being on the right track with God again.

151
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,140
 Now, why are we going through the book of Galatians

152
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,620
 at this point in time as a church?

153
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,700
 So we're also a new church plant.

154
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,420
 So similar to the Galatian churches.

155
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,500
 Now, there's no specific deceiving or false teachers

156
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,380
 who have come here, just wanna be clear about that.

157
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,900
 That's not why we're doing this series.

158
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,060
 I'm not like talking to somebody indirectly.

159
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,020
 But one of the things that is so essential for us

160
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,620
 as a new church is that we build our church,

161
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,580
 our community on the right foundation,

162
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,340
 that we build it on the gospel of Jesus Christ,

163
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,420
 to the good news about Jesus,

164
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,300
 and that we work out the implications

165
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,420
 of that gospel in our lives.

166
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,340
 There's a lot of implications for that,

167
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,420
 how we relate to one another,

168
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,300
 how God has made us family from these different backgrounds.

169
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,520
 And so we wanna work those things out with each other.

170
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,700
 But then also we wanna,

171
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
 when we had the grand opening here in this place,

172
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,820
 we talked about that we wanna be carriers

173
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,560
 of the gospel of peace to our community,

174
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,460
 that we wanna hold forth this good news of Jesus

175
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,300
 to people around us.

176
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,260
 Well, if we wanna do that,

177
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,700
 we have to be clear about what the gospel is,

178
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,100
 and we need to let the gospel do its own work in our lives.

179
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:39,020
 And so that's the first reason why we right now

180
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,820
 as a church wanna look at the book of Galatians,

181
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,940
 'cause we just wanna lay that right foundation,

182
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,820
 we wanna align ourselves right,

183
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,340
 and we wanna be able to confidently go

184
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,500
 and to share with clarity the message,

185
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,660
 the good news of Jesus.

186
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,500
 So that's the first thing.

187
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,500
 The second thing is, Paul in Galatians 4.19, he says this,

188
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,300
 "My dear children, for who I am again

189
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,900
 in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you."

190
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,500
 So Paul, he's using the metaphor

191
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,920
 of giving a second time birth to the same baby.

192
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,820
 He's like, "Why do I have to do this again?

193
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,580
 Why do I have to go through this pain again?"

194
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,580
 But his heart as a Christian leader, as an apostle,

195
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,100
 is he really wants to see people established

196
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,460
 in all the fullness and all the purposes

197
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,340
 that Jesus has for them.

198
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,180
 He wants Christ to be fully formed in them.

199
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:47,340
 Now, our vision as a church is growing big people.

200
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,820
 And ultimately, growing big people

201
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,940
 is to become more like Jesus,

202
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,220
 is to become more Christ-like.

203
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,060
 And so Paul, as he was seeing

204
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,180
 where these false teachers were leading the Galatians,

205
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,700
 that would not lead to the life

206
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,220
 that God wants to bring about in his people.

207
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,420
 It would not bring the life

208
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,500
 where we're in keeping in step with the Spirit

209
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,300
 that bears the fruit of the Spirit.

210
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,660
 And then Paul wants to see that life unfold

211
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,620
 so that the Galatian Christians,

212
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,860
 they can live an empowered life,

213
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,580
 that they can be empowered disciples of Jesus,

214
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,420
 you know, who are led and empowered by the Spirit.

215
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,020
 Because whatever the false teachers were paddling

216
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,980
 was a spiritual dead end.

217
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,380
 It didn't produce anything good

218
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,220
 'cause it was devoid of the Spirit of God

219
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,780
 and devoid of the power of God, what they were claiming.

220
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,340
 So those are the reasons why we are going through

221
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,180
 the book of Galatians at this point in time.

222
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,460
 Of course, we're gonna unpack more as we go through this.

223
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,620
 But today, we're gonna start off by looking at

224
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,620
 how does Paul address the Galatians?

225
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,980
 How does he help them get back on track?

226
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,180
 How does he help them find that life

227
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,580
 that God is calling them and wanting them to have?

228
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,780
 How does he lead them back to that?

229
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,660
 And so that's what I wanna look at with you today

230
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,660
 in this message.

231
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,620
 And so we're in Galatians chapter one, verse one.

232
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,100
 So let me read this to you.

233
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,180
 It says, "Paul, an apostle,

234
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,940
 sent not from man nor by man,

235
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,420
 but by Jesus Christ and God the Father,

236
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,760
 who raised them from the dead

237
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,540
 and all the brothers and sisters with me

238
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,780
 to the churches in Galatia.

239
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,880
 Grace and peace to you from God our Father

240
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,900
 and the Lord Jesus Christ,

241
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,360
 who gave himself for our sins to rescue us

242
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,860
 from the present evil age,

243
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,480
 according to the will of God the Father,

244
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,380
 to whom be glory forever and ever, amen."

245
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,740
 I'm astonished that you are so quickly

246
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,820
 deserting the one who called you to live

247
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,740
 in the grace of Christ

248
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,980
 and are turning to a different gospel,

249
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,300
 which is really no gospel at all.

250
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,940
 Evidently, some people are throwing you into confusion

251
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,700
 and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.

252
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,380
 But even if we or an angel from heaven

253
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,940
 should preach a gospel other than the one we preach to you,

254
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,420
 let them be under God's curse.

255
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,880
 As I have already said, so now I say again,

256
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,940
 if anybody is preaching to you a gospel other

257
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,460
 than what you accepted,

258
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,420
 let them be under God's curse.

259
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,060
 And now, am I now trying to win the approval

260
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,500
 of human beings or of God?

261
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,020
 Or am I trying to please people?

262
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,440
 If I still were trying to please people,

263
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,060
 I would not be a servant of Christ.

264
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,460
 Wow, that's a lot, right?

265
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,960
 There's a lot to unpack there.

266
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:09,540
 So how does Paul start addressing the Galatians

267
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,660
 who are losing their way

268
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,580
 and is trying to get them to come back?

269
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,220
 Well, there's a lot of things he does.

270
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,540
 The first thing is he actually really names the problem

271
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,400
 and the issue.

272
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,940
 So he addresses what the problem is.

273
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,260
 And so actually most of this addresses what the problem is.

274
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,220
 And there's two main problems.

275
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,920
 Well, let me just focus on these verses six and seven.

276
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,800
 So there he says,

277
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,580
 "I'm astonished that you were so quickly deserting

278
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,540
 "the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ

279
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,620
 "and are turning to a different gospel,

280
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,720
 "which is really no gospel at all.

281
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,100
 "Evidently, some people are throwing you into confusion

282
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,940
 "and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ."

283
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,620
 So Paul, he is astonished.

284
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,020
 He is exasperated.

285
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,740
 He is dumbfounded.

286
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,300
 Like, what's wrong with you people?

287
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,180
 That's what he's saying.

288
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,220
 Like, what happened?

289
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,620
 I was just there with you not that long ago.

290
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,580
 And now suddenly you're on this totally different track.

291
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,220
 I mean, he really can't help himself,

292
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,680
 but expresses his surprise.

293
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,420
 And they were deserting the,

294
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,660
 they were not living anymore,

295
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,060
 moving away from living in the grace of Christ.

296
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,100
 That's what he says.

297
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,140
 So the story of Galatians

298
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,860
 actually points to all of our tendencies.

299
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,460
 That we are, what's that song, "Prone to Wander," right?

300
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,060
 What's the actual, it's a hymn.

301
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,080
 I don't know hymns that well.

302
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,540
 But there's a line that says, "Prone to Wander."

303
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,500
 Well, that's us.

304
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,620
 We're prone to wander.

305
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,260
 But people, we get off track all the time.

306
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,080
 But God had done this incredible saving work

307
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,040
 in the Galatians' life.

308
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,040
 And Paul, he takes them actually back to their experience.

309
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,280
 Because when Paul preached the gospel message,

310
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,940
 God called the Galatians to themselves.

311
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,800
 You know, whenever the gospel message is preached,

312
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,320
 God calls people to himself

313
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,280
 through the preaching of the gospel.

314
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,160
 And they responded with faith.

315
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,600
 And they received the Holy Spirit,

316
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,240
 experienced God's power working in their lives.

317
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,040
 And so Paul is taking them back to it.

318
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,320
 And then he's, but then he's like,

319
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,480
 but why are you now so quickly deserting

320
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,660
 the one who called you?

321
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,500
 Why are you turning away from him?

322
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,300
 And they're turning their backs on God's grace.

323
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,520
 So what was happening?

324
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,280
 And then he says that they're returning to a non-gospel,

325
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,180
 that the gospel message was perverted,

326
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,500
 or they perverted the gospel of Christ.

327
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,300
 So what was this message?

328
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,580
 Well, the rival missionaries,

329
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,980
 they added something to the gospel message.

330
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,420
 So instead of it just being Christ's saving work,

331
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,660
 it's like they added a plus.

332
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,020
 And then it was also circumcision

333
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,820
 and observance of the law that was needed.

334
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,960
 And Paul is saying that by doing that,

335
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,340
 they are completely changing the gospel.

336
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,580
 It's not a gospel at all anymore when we do that.

337
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,220
 Because now what happens when you add something to,

338
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,060
 when there's something else that is needed

339
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,660
 to bring you into God's family,

340
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,700
 to make you a Christian besides Jesus'

341
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,660
 saving work on the cross,

342
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,820
 what happens is you start putting Jesus aside

343
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,460
 because you don't really need Jesus.

344
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,740
 And you start putting our own efforts in the center

345
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,480
 of law observing, of doing this, of doing that.

346
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,460
 And so Paul is saying like,

347
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,340
 and that changes everything.

348
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,380
 That is no longer good news

349
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,020
 because then you becoming part of God's family,

350
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,180
 you living the empowered life has to do with you,

351
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,580
 not with Jesus.

352
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:13,460
 And so let me try to,

353
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,380
 we're gonna unpack this more throughout the series.

354
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,100
 This is today just scratching the surface with this.

355
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,180
 But let me unpack this a little bit more.

356
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:26,180
 So I have a definition of what the gospel is.

357
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,460
 So the heart of the gospel message

358
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,140
 is that Christ died for our sins,

359
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,260
 that he freed us from the power of sin

360
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,580
 and evil over our lives,

361
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,500
 filled us with his Holy Spirit

362
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,540
 and brought us into a personal relationship with God.

363
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,220
 Our right standing with God is 100% the work of Christ.

364
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,880
 100%, not like 80/20.

365
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,780
 We come empty handed to God.

366
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,620
 There is nothing that we can do out of our own effort

367
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,000
 to earn the right standing with God.

368
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,560
 We simply respond with repentance and faith

369
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,600
 to the good news and receive the gift of salvation.

370
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:19,260
 And whenever we add things to the gospel,

371
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:26,860
 then suddenly we start relying on our own efforts

372
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,340
 and we still do that today.

373
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,900
 We still add things to the gospel message.

374
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,500
 Maybe it's like if you wanna be really a Christian,

375
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,320
 you not only need to believe in Jesus

376
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,540
 and receive his forgiveness

377
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,720
 and come to him with repentance, faith,

378
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,340
 but you also need to believe these certain doctrines

379
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,700
 that a particular church holds

380
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,980
 and you need to do these certain actions.

381
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:54,140
 And so then we're putting extra requirements

382
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,300
 in the way of people who God wants to come to,

383
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,060
 that God wants for them to come to himself.

384
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,980
 And then really what this, if you think about it too,

385
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,980
 is if it depends on us, what if we really have messed up?

386
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:13,260
 What if our life is such a mess?

387
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,660
 I mean, it would be hopeless for people like us

388
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,360
 when our life is such a mess.

389
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,340
 How could we come to Jesus if it depends on us?

390
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,100
 But because it's 100% the work of Jesus,

391
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,100
 the saving work, that's why anyone can come

392
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,140
 and God can restore and transform your life

393
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,700
 and make you part of his family.

394
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,700
 And so Paul is saying the problem is,

395
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,180
 and it's not a gospel at all,

396
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,220
 is because they have added to the saving work of Christ,

397
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,120
 they have added these additional requirements.

398
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,780
 And that is a non-gospel,

399
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,100
 it's a perversion of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

400
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,140
 So that's what Paul's saying, that's the issue,

401
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,100
 because it's not just a little,

402
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,580
 oh, he did just have a little bit of a different pain,

403
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,480
 no, it's a completely different thing.

404
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,420
 So this is the analysis of Paul from the situation.

405
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,820
 So that's the first thing that he does,

406
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,180
 he takes the Galatian to the analysis of the situation.

407
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,060
 Like this is completely different, this is no gospel,

408
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,500
 you are being misled by this.

409
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,540
 But then the second thing that Paul does,

410
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,420
 he actually takes them also back

411
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,540
 to the grace and peace of Jesus.

412
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,000
 He takes them back to the gospel message themselves

413
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,940
 because they're wondering, they've lost track,

414
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,380
 they've lost their way.

415
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,260
 And what do we do when we lose our way?

416
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,100
 Well, we come back to the cross of Jesus,

417
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,500
 we come back to the grace of Jesus.

418
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,740
 And we allow Jesus to minister to us,

419
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,700
 we come again empty-handed and say,

420
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,100
 Jesus, I'm sorry, forgive me.

421
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,820
 And we receive this grace again,

422
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,260
 and we are strengthened and we are renewed

423
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,660
 in our discipleship, in our relationship.

424
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,700
 And so Paul, and this starts in verse three,

425
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,300
 he takes them, he gives a normal greeting.

426
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,800
 So actually, let me read this.

427
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,620
 It says this, grace and peace to you from God our Father

428
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,960
 and our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins

429
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,320
 to rescue us from the present evil age

430
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,360
 according to the will of our God and Father.

431
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,800
 So grace and peace is like the normal standard greeting

432
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,040
 that Paul uses, and it's a summary of the gospel message.

433
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,040
 Galatians is the only letter where Paul expands

434
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,040
 on that greeting, where he further unfolds

435
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,120
 what the gospel message entails.

436
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,360
 And it might have been even like

437
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,380
 a early Christian confession.

438
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,960
 And so he takes them back to this message

439
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,080
 that he has proclaimed and wants to lead them back

440
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,960
 to this place of where they come empty handed,

441
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,280
 where it doesn't depend on their works,

442
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,960
 and where they just say, Jesus, I need you,

443
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,400
 I surrender to you, I need you to forgive me,

444
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,000
 I need you to get me back on track because I'm off track.

445
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,360
 And that's how the Galatians started, right?

446
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,480
 So he's taking them also back

447
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,400
 to how they first became Christians.

448
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,600
 And I don't know if you ever do that.

449
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,960
 If you ever, in your own story,

450
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,540
 go back to what Jesus has done, I think we forget, right?

451
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,960
 We forget this amazing work that Jesus has done,

452
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,240
 we get distracted.

453
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,640
 And so Paul is taking them back to this amazing moment

454
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,840
 when they first became a Christian.

455
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
 And actually as Christians,

456
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,080
 we need to continue to return to that.

457
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,920
 And we need to continue to receive the gospel message.

458
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,040
 The gospel message doesn't only bring us

459
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,640
 into the family of God, it actually also helps us

460
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,920
 with continuing to live the Christian life

461
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,500
 because we live by the grace and mercy of God.

462
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,560
 And we continuously need it.

463
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,620
 Now, I was a few years back,

464
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:55,520
 I had, I was in Chum Shui Po with some pastors

465
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
 and Francis Chan was there

466
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,200
 and he was telling us about something,

467
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,840
 I don't remember what he was talking about.

468
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,920
 And, but I remember just sitting there

469
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,680
 and listening to Francis Chan.

470
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,560
 If you know Francis Chan, he's a well-known pastor,

471
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,400
 he was here in Hong Kong for a while.

472
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,040
 There's just something about him.

473
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,880
 And as he was talking, was like,

474
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,120
 I could tell man, this guy spends time with Jesus.

475
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,620
 Like he spends time in Jesus's presence.

476
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,760
 And as I was listening to him, I was like,

477
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,920
 I just was feeling the urge to go spend time with Jesus.

478
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,200
 'Cause I had been wandering,

479
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,500
 you know, I had been gotten a little bit lost.

480
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,440
 And so actually after the meeting,

481
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,920
 I called my then boss, Carla, Pastor Carla,

482
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
 and I said, "Hey, Carla,

483
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,600
 I need to go spend some time with Jesus."

484
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,260
 And she of course said, "Yes."

485
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,040
 You know, so I went and spent some time with Jesus.

486
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,320
 But I wonder for us, some of us here today,

487
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,640
 maybe that's what you need to do.

488
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,320
 Is not keep going with whatever you've been doing,

489
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,640
 but actually going back and spending some time

490
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,420
 in intimacy with Jesus.

491
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,120
 Reading his word, maybe even reading passages

492
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,800
 that were about Jesus's death, resurrection,

493
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,600
 about the gospel message.

494
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,820
 Just let the Holy Spirit do a renewing work in your life.

495
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,780
 So Paul takes the Galatians back to their beginning.

496
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,340
 He says, "Man, I've worked in your life.

497
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,560
 Why you suddenly need something else?"

498
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,100
 And he wants them to be renewed as they just dwell

499
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,340
 and meditate and spend time with Jesus.

500
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,980
 But Paul, he keeps hammering away at things.

501
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,020
 And so one thing he does, he declares a curse.

502
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,980
 Did that surprise anyone?

503
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,780
 Right, a lot of times you don't really look at passages

504
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,980
 where people are cursed.

505
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,780
 And so Paul declares a curse on anyone

506
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,820
 who proclaims a different gospel

507
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,180
 than the one that he had shared with them.

508
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,020
 Well, that's intense, right?

509
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,540
 So you can tell this is a serious matter.

510
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,780
 It's not a little thing.

511
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,420
 So I wanna read verse eight to you.

512
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,060
 It says this, "But even if we or an angel from heaven

513
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,660
 should preach a gospel other than the one preached to you,

514
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,860
 let them be under God's curse."

515
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,580
 So Paul is giving them a hypothetical situation.

516
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,420
 Even if an angelic being would come

517
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,840
 and would declare something else,

518
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,300
 they are under curse, he should not believe them,

519
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,500
 even if that were the case.

520
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,080
 And so then he moves from a hypothetical

521
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,300
 to the actual situation.

522
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,940
 In verse nine, he says this.

523
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,940
 "As we have already said, so now I say it again,

524
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,500
 if anybody is preaching to you a gospel

525
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,260
 other than what you accepted,

526
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,540
 let them be under God's curse."

527
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,860
 Well, that's what was happening, right?

528
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,260
 There was a gospel being preached.

529
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,100
 But it's interesting, he doesn't name the agitators.

530
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,180
 He doesn't say, you know, Billy Bob is under curse

531
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,340
 because he preached a different gospel.

532
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,660
 He just gives this general statement.

533
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,980
 Anyone, including himself.

534
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,940
 So Paul is not looking for allegiance to himself.

535
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,900
 What he wants is bring the Galatians back to allegiance

536
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,980
 to the true gospel message,

537
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,940
 that they are committed to it, that they protect it,

538
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,560
 that they understand it, that they guard it.

539
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,620
 I think that's a word for us as a church,

540
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:36,580
 that we have an allegiance to the gospel message.

541
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,460
 That we protect it, that we guard it,

542
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,460
 that we're careful with it ourselves.

543
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,300
 So Paul, again, he's just bringing them back.

544
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,140
 It's all about the gospel, bringing them back,

545
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,180
 you know, from all these different angles.

546
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:56,460
 And then it's interesting, in verse 10, he says this.

547
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,340
 "Am I now trying to win the approval

548
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,980
 of human beings or of God?

549
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,140
 Or am I trying to please people?

550
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,340
 If I were still trying to please people,

551
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,560
 I would not be a servant of Christ."

552
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,740
 Now, apparently the rival missionaries,

553
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,940
 they had accused Paul of being a people pleaser.

554
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,380
 That he proclaimed the gospel that people wanted to hear,

555
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,500
 that was just meeting the itching of their ear.

556
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,340
 That he left out the complicated parts,

557
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,500
 that he only gave them half,

558
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,740
 and he left away the observing the law and circumcision.

559
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,240
 He left away the hard parts.

560
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,780
 And Paul is, I mean, he's already said verses one through nine,

561
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,260
 you know, it's already written all that.

562
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,620
 And he's like, "Hey, do I sound like a guy

563
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,060
 who's trying to please people here?

564
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,580
 Who announces curses and things?

565
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,700
 Do I sound like a people pleaser to you?"

566
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,660
 I mean, that's basically, so it's almost like ironic.

567
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,220
 You know, he's asking the Galatians

568
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,660
 who had apparently started believing in that accusation.

569
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,620
 And what's interesting is that it says

570
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,380
 that if I were still trying to please people,

571
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,860
 so that means Paul used to please people.

572
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,340
 He used to be a people pleaser.

573
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,380
 And I think, I don't know about you,

574
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,840
 people pleasing, I struggle with that.

575
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,060
 You know, I like people,

576
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,660
 I don't wanna rub anyone the wrong way.

577
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,580
 I like people liking me.

578
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,100
 I like harmony, I don't like conflict.

579
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,020
 So sometimes it's just easier to people please, right?

580
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,780
 So I think there's actually another thing

581
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,620
 that gets us off track when we please people

582
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,820
 instead of pleasing God.

583
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,260
 It's also a way that we wander away from God.

584
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,580
 And Paul is saying that he used to do that,

585
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,900
 but something has changed, something has transformed him.

586
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,180
 And we even know what transformed

587
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,420
 because he talks about moving from being a people pleaser

588
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,380
 to now being a servant of Christ and pleasing God.

589
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,900
 So there was somewhere along the way,

590
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,740
 whether that, and I think this was already

591
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,200
 during his Christian journey,

592
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,500
 not that he became a Christian,

593
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,780
 then suddenly he stopped pleasing people completely.

594
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,060
 I think there was still some time

595
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,360
 where that needed to be worked out in his life.

596
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,860
 But where he was committed to doing God's will

597
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,820
 above all else, where he was committed to serving Jesus

598
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,820
 and not to make, you know, please people

599
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,420
 and do what they wanted to hear.

600
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,260
 Now, what are some ways that we please people today?

601
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,460
 Well, we do that in businesses, in our workplaces.

602
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,940
 We do that in our relationships.

603
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,420
 We do that, it happens in the education field,

604
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,660
 families, social media.

605
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,940
 Just think of social media.

606
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:51,580
 When you create a post, carefully crafted,

607
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,780
 hours spent, the right filter.

608
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,120
 Actually, I'm not even good at social media myself.

609
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,940
 So I'm probably the wrong person to talk about this.

610
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,460
 You know, doing this incredible IG story.

611
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,580
 I mean, what are we looking for?

612
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,680
 We're looking for people's approval of us

613
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,380
 that affirm our worth, that say, wow, you're amazing.

614
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,780
 Isn't that true?

615
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,360
 I think so.

616
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,580
 And we also want to avoid getting backlash.

617
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,940
 Has anyone ever gotten backlash

618
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,100
 on some of their social media posts?

619
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,300
 I have.

620
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,180
 I once had 100 messages.

621
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,020
 I touched a subject in the US

622
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,140
 that was about gun violence

623
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,320
 after the Las Vegas shooting,

624
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,620
 and it got really personal.

625
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,420
 We were talking about why do we have

626
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,820
 so many automatic weapons and blah, blah, blah.

627
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,740
 So honestly, after that experience,

628
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,940
 I also am a little bit careful what I say.

629
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,900
 I don't want to deal with the backlash.

630
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:52,820
 But when I was a pastor in the US,

631
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,500
 I wanted to immerse myself in the community,

632
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,460
 not just the Christian community,

633
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,940
 but actually just the community where I was living.

634
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,260
 And so I decided to volunteer in a library,

635
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,860
 in a public library.

636
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,500
 So I helped out with cleaning the office, the background.

637
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,700
 I started shelving books, whatever they needed.

638
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,780
 I just helped out and was getting to know people

639
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,540
 while I was doing that.

640
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,160
 So after being there for a while,

641
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,700
 one of the employees asked me

642
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,980
 to start scanning out 20 books

643
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,100
 or checking out 20 books

644
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,780
 and then just put them in the return box.

645
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,180
 And I do that multiple times.

646
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,780
 So I started doing that.

647
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,500
 And after a while, I was thinking,

648
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,020
 I was like, what am I doing here?

649
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,820
 Why am I checking out books in the library,

650
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,900
 taking them from their shelf,

651
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,700
 put them in the return box?

652
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,260
 And so I realized that I was somehow

653
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,700
 manipulating some book circulation statistics or something

654
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,080
 that probably was needed for whether it's local

655
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,620
 or government funding or something.

656
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,980
 But you know what?

657
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,860
 I was a people pleaser.

658
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,700
 I kept doing it.

659
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:58,420
 Now it bothered me so much the next week

660
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,780
 that when I came back, I was like,

661
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,940
 if he asked me to do it,

662
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,620
 I'm gonna say that I don't wanna do it.

663
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,500
 And so that's what I'm doing.

664
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,300
 And truth of the matter, I'm volunteering, right?

665
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,220
 What do I have to lose?

666
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,140
 So even so stupid to even try to please someone

667
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,440
 where you're volunteering.

668
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,600
 (audience laughing)

669
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,740
 But then think about when it's in places

670
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,420
 where it really matters.

671
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,860
 You know, when it's about a family,

672
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,200
 where not you're gonna have a paycheck

673
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,460
 and you ask to compromise and manipulate something

674
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,480
 or evade taxes or whatever it may be.

675
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,780
 Then it's different.

676
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,060
 So that's one way that we also get off track.

677
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:39,060
 And Paul, he's giving us an example of,

678
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,940
 you know, when we have security

679
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,820
 of Jesus's work in our lives,

680
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:49,140
 when we can just rest in that we are loved,

681
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,180
 we are accepted, you know, by God,

682
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:57,340
 then that actually frees us up

683
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,560
 to the need to be people pleasers.

684
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,760
 You know, it can be really transformative

685
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,780
 as our identity in Christ gets more and more solid.

686
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,420
 We have less and less the need to need to please people.

687
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,060
 And so Paul was encouraging the Galatians

688
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,220
 also in the strong identity formation,

689
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,220
 you know, that they more and more become people

690
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,220
 who choose to please God and instead of pleasing man.

691
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:28,380
 Now, where does all of this leave us?

692
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,620
 And I wanna invite the worship team to come up at this point.

693
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,540
 All right, at the beginning of the sermon, I asked,

694
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,660
 so what do you do when you lose your way as a Christian?

695
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,440
 How do you find your way back into the life

696
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,240
 that God is calling you to live?

697
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,900
 And we saw several things.

698
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,900
 For one, maybe we understand what has misled us

699
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,940
 or taken us away from the life of God in the first place.

700
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,200
 And then maybe today as I was sharing,

701
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,700
 there was actually some things that came up for yourself,

702
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,620
 like, where you're like, wow, it can be business,

703
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,940
 it can be other priorities, it can be many different things.

704
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,840
 Can be people pleasing.

705
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,420
 But then we also looked, what does Paul do?

706
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,260
 Well, he takes them back to the gospel.

707
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:19,220
 He takes them back to this when they encountered Jesus

708
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,500
 for the first time and experienced just as love and grace

709
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,940
 where they came empty handed to him, they had nothing.

710
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,060
 And he received them, he brought them into his family.

711
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,600
 That was not because they met some circumcision

712
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,620
 or other requirements or believed these 20 doctrines

713
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,140
 and did 20 acts of service a day.

714
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,540
 It was just because Jesus loves them,

715
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,840
 forgives them and gives them grace.

716
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:55,540
 And so, and then we saw that Paul also just shows

717
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:00,100
 that he really wants us, the gospel to be centered

718
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,660
 in our life, that we meditate on it,

719
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,420
 that we don't lose track of it

720
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,500
 because it also helps us as a church, as individuals,

721
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,400
 to stay on track of what Jesus has for us,

722
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,640
 that we live by his grace and mercy.

723
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,900
 And when you live by grace instead of your own achievements,

724
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,020
 you're less judgmental, you're less prideful

725
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,920
 because you know you don't deserve it.

726
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,700
 And you just really live a different life.

727
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,380
 And so that's where Jesus is inviting us.

728
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,480
 He goes, I wanna invite everyone to stand.

729
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,720
 And if you've been wondering, you know what,

730
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,560
 whatever it may be, if you feel like, man,

731
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,760
 I've gotten off track in my faith,

732
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,480
 maybe I'm not as passionate as I wanna be,

733
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,600
 maybe I'm totally doing illegal, wrong things,

734
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,920
 pleasing people, but you know, whatever it may be,

735
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,920
 I wanna invite you to actually just come right now.

736
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,360
 Jesus is here, just to come to him,

737
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,800
 to turn to him, to his presence

738
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,800
 and just to receive his grace and forgiveness again.

739
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,840
 And I wanna encourage you to just,

740
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,660
 if that's you, just stretch out your hands before,

741
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,860
 you know, just love to pray over you right now.

742
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,360
 If you're saying, Jesus, I need you,

743
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,820
 I'm sorry, I've wondered, will you show me your grace again?

744
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,420
 Just stretch out your hand and let me pray over you.

745
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:33,160
 So Jesus, I thank you that you are the God

746
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,480
 who brings people back on track.

747
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,860
 You meet us in our wondering,

748
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,280
 we're unfaithful, but you are faithful.

749
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,120
 You love us and you love showing us your grace.

750
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,920
 You love showing us your goodness.

751
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,040
 And I pray for everyone right now

752
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,440
 that feels like they've been off track,

753
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,120
 that you renew them right now through your forgiveness,

754
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,320
 that you renew them through your grace,

755
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,520
 through your love, through acceptance,

756
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,960
 and that you strengthen them.

757
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,240
 That you strengthen the resolve to be servants of you,

758
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,760
 to please you.

759
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,520
 I pray that you root them deeper and deeper

760
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,000
 in your love for them,

761
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,760
 and the identity that you give us as your beloved children.

762
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,560
 I pray, Holy Spirit, that you make that real,

763
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,720
 that this is something we can feel and we know.

764
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,300
 (gentle music)

765
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,120
 Thank you, Holy Spirit.

766
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,820
 Thank you for your work right now.

767
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,640
 Thank you, Jesus, for your grace.

768
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,040
 Thank you for your mercy.

769
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,800
 Thank you that in you, we can always start anew.

770
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,440
 Doesn't matter what has happened.

771
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,440
 So I pray for your blessing over us as a church,

772
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,320
 that you strengthen us with your grace,

773
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,480
 that you pour your love over us,

774
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,600
 I pray this in your name Jesus. Amen. Let's let's worship.
