1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 So, Merry Christmas by the way.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 (audience cheering)

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Merry Christmas by the way.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 (audience cheering)

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 All right, good.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 So, when I was a kid, and we got lots of kids with us today.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 When I was a kid, my greatest passion was skateboarding.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Okay?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 I grew up in the 80s.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Anybody else grew up in the 80s?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Come on, let's hear it.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Loud and proud 80s people.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 My buddy.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Are you sure?

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 No, just kidding, I know you're 80s.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 All right.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I grew up in the 80s, and skateboarding was a thing, massive in the 80s.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 So, I remember when I first saw somebody skateboarding.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I was watching a surfing video with a friend in the mid 80s.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 And this surfer, on the off season, would take his surfboard,

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 and he would get a pair of roller skates,

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 and he would nail the roller skates under the surfboard,

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 so he could surf down the street to practice his surf moves

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 when the waves weren't happening.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And I thought to myself, I live in a city filled with concrete.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I grew up here in Hong Kong, and I was like,

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 if this is the place to skateboard, surely this is the place.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 We don't get many waves in the ocean,

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 but we have a lot of concrete that we could ride in.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And from that moment of watching the surfer surf on his makeshift skateboard,

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I convinced myself that all I wanted for Christmas was a skateboard.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 So I said to my parents, I really, really want a skateboard.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 So on Christmas morning, 1988, I got my very first skateboard.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Yes! Let me show you a photo of it.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 There it is. On the right-hand side was my skateboard.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 It was a Tony Hawk model. That's me!

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Okay, that's me trying to pretend like I'm flying in the air,

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 doing a skateboard trick, but I'm actually just kneeling on the ground.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 But that's me in the 80s. That was my skateboard.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 This skateboard that you can see me holding is also mine.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I brought this when I turned 40 because I had a midlife crisis

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 and could not afford a motorbike.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So I brought myself a skateboard, and I started skating again when I turned 40.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 In the 80s, though, skateboarding was a thing,

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 and I spent every single moment of my free time skateboarding.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 We built up a skate group in the neighborhood where I was living,

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 and it was amazing.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 I actually became quite good at the skateboard.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 In fact, good enough that I could skateboard down the road

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 and skateboard between cars.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 On one particular day, I was doing that down Braemar Hill

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 because it was a really big slope, a big hill up there,

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 and I was skating between all the cars on the road,

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 and suddenly I hear a police siren,

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 and a motorbike policeman pulls me over,

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 and he takes me to the side.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 He asks for my ID card. I'm like 15 years old.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I give him my ID card, and he picks up my skateboard.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 He's like, "Hmm."

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 He's like, "You are very talented on this thing."

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I was like, "Thank you, Mr. Police Officer."

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Am I so talented that I'm not going to get fined?

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And he's like, "It's illegal to skateboard on the road in Hong Kong."

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I'm like, "Yeah, I kind of know."

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And he's like, "Do not do it again."

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And then he let me go. It was awesome.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Because you know that the legend status of any skateboarder

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 goes to 100 million if they've been pulled over by the police.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Because that's what every skateboarder wants,

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 is a story of being arrested by the police.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 So my legendary status in the neighbourhood just rose.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Now, one particular day,

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 a new kid showed up in our neighbourhood with a skateboard.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Now, we had a pretty tight group of friends.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 We were like a family together.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 We thought we were the cool kids of the neighbourhood.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And this other kid shows up with his own skateboard.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And I was like, "Who's this joker?"

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Can he join our cool club of skateboarders?

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Does he skateboard well?

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And as we're trying to chat with him and get to know him,

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 he goes, "Let me show you what my dad made for me."

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And he showed us a skate ramp that his dad had made for him.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Coolest dad in the world.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Made him this skate ramp.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And it was about our head height.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 When I was about 15, I might have been about this high or so.

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And the skate ramp was that big.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 It was a big slope that came up.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And the whole idea was you would skate up to the ramp

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 and try and launch off the other end and do a trick,

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 just like the one that I'm pretending to do right there.

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 That was the whole thing.

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So he showed us this skate ramp.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And all of us, all of us as part of the skate gang,

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 were terrified of skate ramps.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Because we had never skated on a ramp before.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Here in Hong Kong now, you actually have skate parks and skate ramps.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Back in my day, in the 80s, there were no skate parks,

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 no skate ramps in Hong Kong.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 This guy had a ramp.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 It was super cool.

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 But we were terrified of it.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Now I realized that I wanted to make a deep connection with this guy.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I wanted him to feel at home in our skate gang.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And I'm a very EQ-orientated person.

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Not particularly IQ, but quite EQ.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 You know what I mean?

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Like I feel people's emotions,

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 and I want people to feel safe and happy all the time.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And so I could see him showing off his proud skate ramp

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 that none of us wanted to skate on.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And I wanted to take a risk in order to connect with him.

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 In order to make him feel like he's welcomed into our family.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 I was willing to give the skate ramp a go

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 in order that he might feel welcomed into our gang.

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Does that make sense to you?

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 It was the dumbest idea I have ever made.

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 So I decided I went right back as far away from the ramp as I could.

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 I didn't have a helmet.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 We didn't have any knee pads.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 No safety gear whatsoever.

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 The skate ramp was about 20 yards ahead of me.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I had my skate like this.

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And I was like, "Go!"

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And I skated as fast as I could.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Jumped up on my board.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 I'm going like super fast.

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I'm coming up to the skate ramp.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I hit the skate ramp.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And then everything went wrong.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I hit the skate ramp.

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And my skate goes all the way up in the air.

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 It starts spiraling.

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 It flies massively there.

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I'm literally in the air, turning around, without a helmet,

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 about to land face first onto the ramp.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I landed face first onto the ramp.

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I then slid all the way down the ramp.

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And I had so much momentum that I then skidded on the concrete.

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And my arm was behind me as I was skidding on the concrete.

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 And my skin of my arm was so dragged like this

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 that the skin here came onto my elbow,

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 bore a hole in it, almost all the way down to the bone.

145
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Blood is going everywhere.

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It's the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 This new kid, feeling probably guilty about the ramp,

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 runs over to me to see if I'm okay.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And I'm lying on the ground.

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 By the way, I've still got a scar here.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 You can come later and I'll show it to you in real life, right?

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 I'm lying there.

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 I've got like tears in my eye.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Blood's coming from my arm.

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I am overwhelmed.

156
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 He stands over me.

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And as our eyes lock, there's this pregnant pause between us.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And then he says this,

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 "That was awesome! You're awesome!"

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And I was like, "It was awesome! It was so good!"

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 We became best friends forever.

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 After that day, even my pain and my sacrifice,

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 to welcome him into the family,

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 we were inseparable after that.

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And we were like the best mates for years.

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 We skated together, had a lot of fun together.

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I never went near the ramp ever again.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Now I wonder if you could think about the themes of risk,

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 of valuing somebody,

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 of doing everything you can to make them feel like

171
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 you're a part of the family.

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Those themes, although they don't get talked a lot about at Christmas time,

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 are actually the central themes of Christmas Day,

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 the day that we gather here together to celebrate.

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 It's the central idea of what Christmas Day is all about,

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 the reality that Jesus has come.

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And when John, the gospel writer,

178
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 wants to write a little bit about the arrival of Jesus,

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 the birth of Jesus.

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Now you'll know if you know the Bible well,

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 that really only Matthew and Luke include details about Jesus' birth.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 So most of the time at Christmas,

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 we sit in either Matthew or Luke.

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But maybe you didn't know that John actually mentions also

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 the birth of Jesus right at the beginning of his gospel.

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And when he does, he's trying to pull on the themes of risk,

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 and connection, and intimacy,

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 in explaining what happened on the day that we're celebrating today.

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 I want to make sure I don't trip on my skateboard and break my neck.

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Let me read to you John chapter 1,

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 and just a few verses where John mentions the birth of Jesus.

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Starting in verse 12.

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 It says, "Yet to all who received him,

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 to those who have believed in his name,

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 he gave the right to become children of God.

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Children born not of descent,

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 nor of human decision or a husband's will,

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 but born of God.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 So the Word became flesh,

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 and made his dwelling among us.

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 We have seen his glory,

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 the glory of the one and only,

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 who came from the Father,

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 full of grace and truth."

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 John writes here, and he says,

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 you need to understand something about the Christmas day.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 About the moment that Jesus came into the world.

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And he describes it like this.

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 The Word, speaking of Jesus,

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 and he's just spent the early part of this chapter explaining the Word.

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 The Word was there at the beginning,

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 and the Word was mighty and glorious.

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 The Word was the light to the world,

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 but the world didn't understand it.

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 All of this beautiful stuff.

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 But then he says, guess what?

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 This Word didn't stay distant from us,

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 but the Word took flesh and dwelt among us.

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 The word dwelling there means to make a home amongst us.

220
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 It's like literally God decided,

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 I don't want heaven anymore to be my home.

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 I want the earth to be my home.

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And it's almost like God was like,

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 how can I take a risk to show how much I value connecting with humanity?

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 You see, the incarnation was an incredible risk.

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Think about it from the perspective of God.

227
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 He had every power in all of the universe.

228
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And in order to show us his love,

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 and to welcome us into relationship with him,

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 he was willing to give up all of that power

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 and be found microscopic embryo in Mary.

232
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 All the power of heaven dwindled to the infancy of a child.

233
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 The incarnation is God's way of saying,

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I so value you that I'm going to move into your neighborhood

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 so that you can move into my neighborhood.

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 I so value you that I'm willing to take a risk

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 so that you could come and know me.

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 A little bit like how I was willing to take a risk on that day

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 to try out that skate ramp because I wanted that kid

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 to feel like he was a part of the club.

241
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Jesus looks down on the earth,

242
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 looks down on broken humanity,

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 and so longs to be in intimacy with one of us

244
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 that he was willing to become one of us.

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 So desiring to be in intimate relationship with you

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 that he was willing to actually become like you.

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 So put on eyebrows and a saliva gland and a spleen

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 and move into your neighborhood

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 so that he might connect with you.

250
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Might say, hey, I'm here with you.

251
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Might help you to know that there is a God

252
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 that's willing to dwindle himself down to human level

253
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 so that we might have a God that we could know personally.

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 I mean, that's the beauty and the wonder

255
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 of why we gather here today.

256
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And as a parent myself, I've experienced this kind of love

257
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 that I think drove God to send his son on Christmas day.

258
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 This love that says, I will do whatever it takes

259
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 to connect with you.

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Whatever it takes to be like you.

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Your interest will become my interest.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Your pain will be like my pain.

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 I will absorb it all together so that you can know me.

264
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 As a parent, I've come to experience that.

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Chris and I adopted our daughter Mia,

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 who's sitting right here,

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 and it's gonna be incredibly embarrassed,

268
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 but I love you, baby.

269
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 We adopted her when she was like 16 months old,

270
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 and now she's 12,

271
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 and she's turning into this incredible woman.

272
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And throughout her whole life,

273
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 I've done everything I can to connect with her

274
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 and to show her that love.

275
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And that means having her passions become my passions.

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 The things that she loves become the things that I love.

277
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 I've even gotten to the point

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 where I'm listening to Blackpink.

279
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 (audience laughing)

280
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Yes!

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 (audience cheering)

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 And I tell you, throughout our relationship,

283
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 man, we've had some great times.

284
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I've become Mia's mannequin for putting makeup on

285
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 so she could practice how to put makeup on.

286
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Okay, I've won pretty dresses

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 so that Mia would also wear pretty dresses alongside of me.

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 We've done dance-offs to '80s music all the time,

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 and she always wins.

290
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 I've had my nails painted,

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 both my fingernails and my toenails painted so many times,

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I cannot count them.

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And guess what?

294
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 That paint stays on for weeks.

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 There have been so many sermons

296
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 that I have preached with pink toenails

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 that you had no idea about

298
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 because Mia had painted my nails.

299
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Her interests become my interests,

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 and that's my way of showing my love for her.

301
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And that's Christmas morning.

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 That's why we're gathered here,

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 because God decided that your interests were his interests.

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Your pain would become his pain.

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Your joy would be his joy

306
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 because he wants you to be in relationship with him.

307
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 He wants you to know him, and love drove it for him.

308
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 This is why John, when he's trying to capture this idea for his people,

309
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 he says this in verse 12.

310
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 He says, "Yet all who received him,

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 to those who believed in him,

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 he gave the right to become the children of God."

313
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 See, the whole purpose of the incarnation,

314
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 the whole reason why Jesus came down on this day that we celebrate

315
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 is so that we would then be welcomed into his family.

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Like my friend in that skateboard that day with the ramp

317
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 who became a part of our gang,

318
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Jesus comes so that we might be invited into his family,

319
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 so that we would become children of God.

320
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 How does that process happen?

321
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Well, John explains it.

322
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 He says, "For all, first of all, who have received him."

323
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 It's a powerful statement.

324
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 This is Christmas day where all have received Jesus.

325
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Whether you're a Christian or not, you have received Jesus.

326
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Jesus has come.

327
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 It's a historical fact that Mary and Joseph gave birth to a child

328
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 who had become known as Jesus.

329
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 It's a historical fact that he lived in Galilee

330
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 and travelled there and taught there.

331
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 It's a historical fact that he was killed by the Roman Empire.

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 This is Jesus who has come to us.

333
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 In other words, everybody has received him,

334
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 and that's the wonder of Christmas.

335
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 That's the connection point of Christmas.

336
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And whether you're a Christian in this room or not,

337
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 maybe someone's invited you today.

338
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Maybe the Christian faith is not something you're necessarily interested in,

339
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 but you're here because you wanted to connect with the interests of somebody you love.

340
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Good job, see? You're being more Christian than you realize.

341
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 There you go.

342
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Your daughter or your son invited you to church today,

343
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 and you decided to come.

344
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Or maybe your parents invited you to come today,

345
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 and you decided to come.

346
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 All of that is because the world has received Jesus.

347
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 But receiving Jesus is not enough.

348
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 It's interesting that Christmas is actually more than that,

349
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 because John then goes on to say this,

350
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 "For all who have received him, to those that have believed in his name."

351
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 You see, there are two elements that he's trying to point out to us.

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 There is the beauty and the wonder of Christmas Day

353
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 where all people in the world, whether they're Christian or not,

354
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 have received Jesus.

355
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 But yet something else happens.

356
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Something else happens for some of us

357
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 when we come into knowing who Jesus is.

358
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 We come to actually believe that he was more than just a child that was born in the stable,

359
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 more than just a man who taught some good moral ethics to people in Galilee,

360
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 more than somebody who was murdered on a cross just by the Roman Empire,

361
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 that actually this Jesus was the Son of God.

362
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 That actually this Jesus carries our sin and brokenness on his shoulders.

363
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 That this Jesus in his resurrection means that we now have eternal life in him

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 by grace and by his forgiveness.

365
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 You see, Christmas is not just about receiving Jesus.

366
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Christmas is also about believing in Jesus.

367
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Those two things go side by side,

368
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 but they're not always things that happen together.

369
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And I think so often the world, and so often I would even argue this,

370
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Christians have just received Jesus, but don't actually believe in him.

371
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Don't actually believe that he can do the things that he did.

372
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Don't actually believe that the promises of the Bible are true.

373
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Don't actually believe that those promises can happen and work in their lives.

374
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Don't actually believe that the Spirit of God could transform a society they have received,

375
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 but they don't fully believe.

376
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Are you with me?

377
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 My grandfather was the most interesting man when it came to Christmas.

378
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 When you would give my grandfather a present from under the Christmas tree, a wrapped present,

379
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 he would take that present, and here's what my grandfather would do.

380
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 He would squeeze it with his hands for a bit,

381
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 and then he would announce what he thought the present was.

382
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 So he'd be like, "Oh, thank you for my present."

383
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

384
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 "Pair of socks."

385
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 And then he'd put it down by the side without opening it.

386
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And then you'd give him another present, and he'd be like, "Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze."

387
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 "Oh, box of chocolates. Thanks so much."

388
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And he'd put it down on the side here.

389
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 The scary thing was he was right 100% of the time.

390
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 I don't know how he did it, but it was kind of scary.

391
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 But you see, John's trying to communicate something here.

392
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 He's saying it's not just about receiving Jesus.

393
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 It's also about believing Him.

394
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And if you just receive Him without believing in Him,

395
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 it's like you've been given the greatest gift that has ever been given,

396
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 wrapped in the wonder of humanity,

397
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 and you have refused to open it and encounter it.

398
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 You've just, like my grandfather, taken a guess and put it down to the side

399
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 and moved on with your life.

400
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And if Christmas is anything, it's an invitation

401
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 into not just knowing that Jesus was born on this day,

402
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 but actually changing your life in believing in Him

403
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 so that your life would be forgiven of your sin,

404
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 that your life would be changed forever,

405
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 so that you would have eternal presence with Him in this world.

406
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 That's the beauty of Christmas.

407
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 It's not a present wrapped that sits on the mantelpiece

408
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 that you look at once a year.

409
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 It's something to be open daily in that encounter of relationship with Him.

410
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 So think of the threads of what Christmas Day is all about.

411
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 The risk that God had to come down to earth and be with us.

412
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 The willingness for Him to suffer and to hurt a little bit

413
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 so that we would come to know Him.

414
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 The beauty of Him getting involved in our interests

415
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 so that we might be then invited into His family.

416
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 That's what then John says right here at the end.

417
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 He says, "So that we would become children of God."

418
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 There it is, part of His family.

419
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 No longer orphans to sin, but children of God.

420
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Part of His life, part of who He is.

421
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 In connection with Him, He's moved into our neighborhood

422
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 so that we can move into His neighborhood,

423
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 so that we can be swept up in His family.

424
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Like my skateboard friend who became a part of our gang,

425
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Jesus comes just in the flesh for you,

426
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 shows His likeness to you,

427
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 becomes interested in you,

428
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 driven by love for you,

429
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 so that you would then be a part of His family.

430
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Welcomed into the comfort and the safety and the security of eternal life.

431
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 What a beautiful thing we celebrate here on Christmas morning.

432
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Every year, the department store in the UK, John Lewis,

433
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 produces a Christmas small short film.

434
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Now, on most years, the film is really designed to help

435
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 to advertise all of the stuff that they sell.

436
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 But this year, in the film that they produce,

437
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 they actually changed it a little bit

438
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 and focused on their philanthropy work,

439
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 the work that they do for the NGOs that they support.

440
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And this year in particular,

441
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 they wanted to highlight the issue in the UK

442
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 of children that are stuck in the foster care system

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 and are institutionalised,

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 and how families in the UK should open their homes

445
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 to accept these children in.

446
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 And although their ad was designed to kind of speak about a philanthropic,

447
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 is that the word, philanthropic? Whatever.

448
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Some sort of charitable focus to it,

449
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 actually the film contains the true, full message

450
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 of the incarnation of Jesus.

451
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And as we watch this film now, I wonder whether also

452
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 you might notice some of the other things

453
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 that I've been talking about with you this morning.

454
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Let's take a look at the film.

455
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Yeah, we can't wait.

456
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 We've got a piece.

457
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 We're really excited.

458
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Merry Christmas.

459
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 You OK?

460
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Yeah, I'm fine.

461
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 How did it go?

462
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Are they on there?

463
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 They're coming.

464
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Hey, Ellie.

465
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Hi.

466
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 I skate a bit too.

467
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 You want to come in?

468
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Oh, it's cool.

469
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Not as good as yours, I don't think.

470
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Oh, well, I'll just have a few stickers, asshole.

471
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 I'm going to get some stickers for you.

472
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 So, like a potential foster dad

473
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 who's willing to have a few injuries

474
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 in order to show an interest to a child

475
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 so that child would be welcomed

476
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 and feel comfortable and safe in their family.

477
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 So, God, looking upon broken humanity,

478
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 looking upon the orphans of us all,

479
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 wanting to welcome us into his family,

480
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 decides a little risk is worth it.

481
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And then the incarnation comes to us, like us,

482
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 so that we ultimately would be welcomed into his family,

483
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 so that we would be comfortable and safe in his presence.

484
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 The beauty of Christmas morning

485
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 is this incredible heart of love that God has,

486
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 a heart that he has for every single person in this room,

487
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 a desire that he is willing to do whatever it takes

488
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 so that you would feel at home with him.

489
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 My prayer for you on Christmas morning

490
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 is that you would know that God,

491
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 that you would come to experience

492
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 the incarnation for you personally,

493
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 that you would know that there is a Father in heaven

494
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 who's willing to do whatever it takes

495
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 so that you would be a child of God.

496
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I wonder whether we could pray together.

497
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Let's pray.

498
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Father, I'm so grateful for everybody here,

499
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 for those online that are watching in this time,

500
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 for those in this room here.

501
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Thank you, Lord, for these incredible children of God of yours.

502
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Lord, we thank you for the challenge today

503
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 to not just receive you, but to believe in you.

504
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 We thank you that through believing in you,

505
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 we become your children.

506
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 We thank you that you have done everything on our behalf.

507
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Like that father in the film

508
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 who was willing to learn something,

509
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 you were willing to

510
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 devoid yourself of all of your power

511
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 in order to be born a helpless, vulnerable child

512
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 in a cave in Bethlehem

513
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 so that we might know you,

514
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 so that we might be safe in your family.

515
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And whilst we're praying,

516
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 if you're here in this room,

517
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 maybe you're not a Christian here,

518
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 and you've been invited to be here today,

519
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 I want to just pray for you

520
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 and just give you a chance today

521
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 to make the best decision you'll ever make.

522
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 You know, that foster child on the outside of the door

523
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 had the choice.

524
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 No one was forcing her to come into this new family,

525
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 but the foster father made it a welcoming place for her.

526
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Jesus has made his home a welcoming place for you.

527
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 But like that foster child, the choice is yours.

528
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Do you step into his family,

529
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 or do you stay on the outside?

530
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 The door is open.

531
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Jesus said, "Anybody who knocks on my door,

532
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 I will open it, and they can come in and be with me."

533
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And so perhaps here today on Christmas morning, 2022,

534
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 that's the decision you want to make in your heart.

535
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 You want to say, "I want to be a part of that family.

536
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 I'm so grateful that God revealed himself

537
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 in the incarnation, Jesus, for me."

538
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And that's a really simple thing for you to do today.

539
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 The way you step into his home

540
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 is just through a simple prayer.

541
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 It's just to say this in your heart,

542
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 "Father, I believe in you.

543
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I don't just receive you.

544
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I may not have all my questions answered,

545
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 but I believe in you today.

546
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And I ask you to forgive me of the things that I've done

547
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 that have hurt you and hurt me and hurt others.

548
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And I thank you that you have forgiven me.

549
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And will you now come and be with me,

550
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 be in me by your Spirit?"

551
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 So that prayer of, "I believe in you.

552
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Would you forgive me for things?

553
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And would you come and be a part of my life?"

554
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 That's the prayer that brings you

555
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 on the threshold into the home.

556
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 And perhaps today that's a prayer you want to make.

557
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 And so in the quietness of your heart,

558
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 you can make that prayer today.

559
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 I want to encourage you that when you make that prayer,

560
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 just share it with somebody.

561
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Maybe with the person who's invited you to be here today.

562
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 You can let them know,

563
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 "Hey, I prayed that prayer that Pastor Andrew asked me to pray."

564
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And that way they can have a chat with you a little bit more.

565
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Or you can come and let us know after the service

566
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 and we will chat with you too

567
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 and let you know a little bit more

568
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 about what it is to live an amazing life

569
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 with Christ Jesus.

570
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 But I also want to pray for those in this room

571
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 who are Christian already.

572
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And you're here on Christmas Day

573
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 and you probably came in today saying,

574
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 "I've heard a thousand Christmas Day messages."

575
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 But you're here today and I believe the Holy Spirit

576
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 is challenging you for deeper intimacy in 2023.

577
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 I believe that Jesus wants to get to know you even more

578
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and you Him.

579
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And maybe your prayer on Christmas morning is,

580
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 "Lord, I want to have a deeper connection with you.

581
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Lord, I want to have your interests as my interests.

582
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 I want to see this world as you see it.

583
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 I want to see Hong Kong and my family

584
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 and my workplace as you see them.

585
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Lord, I want to know your heart.

586
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 I want to know your passion.

587
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 I want to know the mission that you have for me

588
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 and for this world.

589
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 I want to be a part of a bigger story than just my own."

590
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And maybe 2023 for you as a Christian

591
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 is about taking that next step

592
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 in your discipleship with Jesus.

593
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 So whatever it might be for you,

594
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 we pray now that God here on Christmas Day

595
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 would meet you and speak to you,

596
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 love you, revive you, and welcome you again into His family.

597
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

598
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Everyone says, "Amen."

599
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Would you stand with me?

600
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And we're gonna respond together in a closing song of worship.

601
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And worship is so important on Christmas Day.

602
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 It's a way of us just expressing our adoration

603
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 and our love of God.

604
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,400
 So let's do that together as a family.
