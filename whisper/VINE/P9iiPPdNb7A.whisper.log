[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]   When I was, actually, can we pull up the football slide?
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.000]   I do want to talk about that a little bit.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Sorry, that was too exciting.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.080]   Okay, so here you see the, easy, you see the Vinylon team.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.120]   We had an incredible football tournament this past Friday.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.280]   I want to say thank you for those of you who came out to support us.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.560]   Also thank you for those who helped us raise funds for Branches of Hope.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.240]   So we were able to reach 7,000 Hong Kong lives for Branches of Hope.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.480]   So we're excited about that.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.540]   And then, to our own surprise, we actually did quite well.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.320]   So we won the first three games.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.120]   We made it into the playoffs.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.280]   And we ended up losing in the quarterfinal in the penalty shootouts.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.600]   It was very dramatic.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.600]   That's how we liked it.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.600]   So it was good.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.920]   So thank you so much.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.120]   And yeah, thanks for pulling that up.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.080]   But today, it's a one-off message.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.760]   Next week we'll also have a one-off message.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.600]   I just want to share something that was on my heart for you.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.240]   Now when I was a university, or just a young graduate, I had just graduated from university,
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.800]   and it seemed like that the people around me, that things were coming together in their
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.340]   lives.
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.840]   That stuff was working out for them.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.440]   That their careers were working out.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.040]   Their relationships were working out.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.280]   And here there was me, and I was still trying to find my way, my career path.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.960]   I was trying to, I was wondering, you know, is there somebody that I will, that there's
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.760]   a significant other that I'm going to be able to get to spend my life with.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.040]   And during that time, a lot of my friends got married.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.800]   In the US, people marry young.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.080]   They had very promising jobs.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.720]   And so as I was doing this comparison thing, I just really was wondering, you know, am
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.400]   I ever going to be content?
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.520]   Because I was feeling some discontent in my heart.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.520]   Am I going to be okay?
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.760]   Am I going to make it?
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.960]   And there was some anxiety actually around my future.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:25.760]   Now I think we all have experienced this, where we long to experience content in our
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.080]   heart, where we just feel at peace with where we are and what's happening.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.600]   But the reality is, that's actually not easy to come by, is it?
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.320]   To feel content.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.920]   That's something, I feel like it's like, you know, you almost have it, and then it slips
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.080]   through your hands.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.000]   Or feeling content is just something that seems like I'm almost there.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.360]   It's just around the corner.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.520]   If just this one thing happens, then I'm going to feel content.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.320]   My life is going to be amazing.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.480]   You know, everything's going to be good.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.320]   But it always just seems a little bit out of reach for most of us.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.600]   And then there are seasons where we do feel content, and then our circumstances change,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.360]   and all of that goes out the window.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.360]   What do we do then?
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.800]   How should we think about this?
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.680]   Well, what I want to explore with you today through this message, and this word that God
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.160]   has put on my heart, is I want to explore with you this question.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.760]   How can I grow and learn to be content in all circumstances?
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.400]   And is that even something that is possible, or is that just wishful thinking?
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   Does that sound good?
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   Yes.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   A little bit.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   Yes.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   Okay.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   Good, good.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.840]   Just making sure, you know, it's not two people are excited about this.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840]   There's a few more.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.840]   That's good.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.240]   So what we're going to do is we're going to go to the book of Philippians, which is one
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.000]   of the letters that Paul wrote.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.640]   And in Philippians, one of the reasons why he wrote the letter, actually, I was reading
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.840]   one of those introductory New Testament books, there's seven reasons for why Paul wrote the
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.960]   letter of Philippians, but I want to share with you one that is significant for our context,
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.200]   for what we're going to look at, and that is Paul is writing this letter to say thank
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.080]   you for a financial gift that the Philippians have made to him while he is in prison in
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.080]   Rome.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.000]   So Paul is writing this letter from prison in Rome, and he's saying thank you.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.640]   Now what makes this more significant is that Paul and the Philippians, they have a very
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.200]   close relationship.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.400]   He planted the church in Philippi.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   They have been supporting him.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:59.200]   They've been partners with him in ministry and have supported him financially all along.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.280]   But another thing is that they didn't give out of their abundance.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:14.400]   Actually, in second Corinthians, we learned that the Philippians were facing severe trials
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.780]   and that they were living in extreme poverty.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.940]   So their generosity flows out of a place of extreme poverty.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.700]   It's out of the place that they're giving and loving on Paul in his circumstances.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.800]   And so Paul is saying thank you.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.880]   And so this is where we pick up in Philippians four, starting in verse 10, it says this.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.220]   I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.500]   Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.240]   I'm not saying this because I'm in need, for I've learned to be content whatever the circumstances.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.320]   I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:10.360]   I've learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.160]   or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.640]   I can do all this through him who gives me strength.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:28.780]   Now in verse 10, we see that Paul, he rejoices that this concern for him has been renewed.
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:36.760]   And he also acknowledges that they, for whatever reason, for a season, didn't have the opportunity
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.320]   to express their loving concern for Paul.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.320]   Now maybe it was their own difficult circumstances, maybe it was even Paul's circumstances, because
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.320]   I mean he's in prison, Philippi and Rome, they're like 800 kilometers or something like
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.080]   that apart.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.600]   Back then there was no text messaging, so it's hard to keep up with what's going on
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.020]   in each other's lives.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.440]   But at last they have renewed their concern and Paul is just grateful and he says thank
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.520]   you.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.000]   But then he turns things around and he wants to actually encourage them through his own
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.840]   example.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.560]   And so that's what verse 11 and 13 is all about.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.880]   And this is what I want to focus on with us, is how Paul wants to encourage the Philippians
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:28.320]   who are facing struggles, who are facing challenges, and he wants to speak into their lives.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:34.040]   Now as I was praying over what to share, I had a million thoughts, a million ideas, but
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.560]   I just felt that we're one year into our church plant, or a public launch at least, we've
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.600]   been doing this longer.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.560]   There's a lot of things, I know there's a lot of things going on in your lives, and
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:52.160]   I just felt that God wants to encourage us and give us confidence in who he is so that
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:08:02.400]   we can learn to be content and know him, know his power in all circumstances of our lives.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:10.680]   So that was my sense for the day and so that's what I want to share with you.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.200]   So let me take you to verse 11 and 12.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.380]   It says, "I'm not saying this because I'm in need, for I've learned to be content whatever
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.320]   the circumstances.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.880]   I know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have plenty.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.320]   I've learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.520]   or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want."
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:40.460]   So Paul is saying, "Hey, I'm grateful for your gift.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.360]   Thank you so much."
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:50.600]   But then he says, and this is super interesting, "But your gift is not what guarantees me being
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.940]   content.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:58.160]   My external circumstances, they don't determine whether or not I feel content."
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.360]   Now this is actually mind blowing, right?
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.480]   He's in prison.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.400]   Now in prison back in the days, it wasn't that the government was collecting money and
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.320]   then uses money to feed prisoners.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.000]   Prisoners depended on family members and friends to actually bring needed resources to the
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   prison.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.920]   If you had nobody bringing you anything, that was it.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:28.320]   And so, but Paul is saying, "My wellbeing does not depend on gifts like this.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.680]   It depends on something else."
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:39.520]   And he also, he was not somebody who was living this luxurious life where everything was working
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.520]   out perfectly.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   He didn't have any challenges.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.280]   I mean, he's in prison.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.920]   He had people, churches that he loved turn on him.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.840]   We saw him as his enemies.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.160]   He was beaten several times almost to death.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.960]   So I mean, this guy, for him to say that is very significant.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.440]   These are not just like easily spoken words from somebody who's like comfortable sitting
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.400]   somewhere on a nice sofa having a drink.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:16.880]   Now let's continue to, actually before I go any further, let me define what we mean by
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880]   content.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.800]   And I want to give a Christian definition of this.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:28.000]   So here's a definition, says this, "Contentment describes finding peace, joy, and satisfaction
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.960]   regardless of life circumstances."
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:40.480]   So Paul is making this incredible claim that regardless of what happens outside of him,
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:49.120]   he can know the joy, the satisfaction, and the contentment in the Lord, the peace that
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.840]   surpasses all understanding.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.080]   This is absolutely incredible.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.960]   But of course we wonder, is this really true?
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:04.280]   You know, is this something that we can actually really experience and know?
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.040]   So let's continue to unpack this.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.640]   So in verse 12, Paul says, "I have learned the secret of being content."
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.520]   Now this is very interesting.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:20.280]   It has the word learned and it has the word secret.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.920]   Now why would Paul use these two words, that he learned and it's a secret?
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.880]   Well, I believe that it points us towards this learning to be content or being content
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.720]   is not something that is just easily come by.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.840]   There has been some lessons, life lessons along the way that have brought Paul to this
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.400]   point.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:49.000]   But you also use the word secret because not everyone knows how to experience this contentment.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.560]   Just think of like books.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.120]   I actually did some Amazon search about some book titles that uses the word the secret.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.640]   So the secret of lasting beauty.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.440]   You know, ooh, I want to know that.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.400]   I'm getting older, you know.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.480]   The secret of a successful marriage.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.880]   That's a good one.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.360]   The secret of winning at life.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.480]   Why do these books exist?
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.520]   Because we're looking for the code, right?
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:26.520]   We want to find the answer to these questions or something that's just not easily available.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.640]   We want to know the answer because we want to experience the good marriage, the lasting
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.680]   beauty, the good life.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   And so we buy these books, attend these workshops, you know, do all these things.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:48.680]   But Paul is using this to just say this experience of contentment, you know, it's not something
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:56.040]   that is easily come by and actually eludes or is not easily available or obvious to everyone
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.980]   how to experience that.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.280]   And people actually really struggle with that.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.160]   Now I want to be clear, he's not saying actually through his passage, he tells us how we can
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.440]   learn to be content or how we find contentment.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.520]   So he's actually, it's an open secret in what he's writing.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.160]   But he's using this language to show us, you know, that it's actually something that doesn't
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.080]   come easy our way.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.640]   So the first thing is that real contentment is a secret.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:32.080]   But just because it's hard for us to be content, it does not stop us from trying, does it?
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:40.160]   We often believe that the desire for contentment will be satisfied by accomplishments, material
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:49.040]   possessions, relationships, and the approval of others.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.360]   We say to ourselves, "Hey, you say it's a secret.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.720]   Hey, I know the secret.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.840]   I know the answer to what will make me content.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:02.040]   If only I have this relationship, if only I get married, if only I have this house,
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:07.720]   if only I can stay in this job a little bit longer and I get that promotion, if only I
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:14.380]   get the approval from my father that I've been working so hard for."
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:22.080]   And I just wonder, I'm just thinking about ourselves, what have you been telling yourself
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.320]   that will give you contentment?
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:32.960]   You know, what are you thinking in these material things or other achievements that will provide
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.920]   contentment for you?
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.000]   Is it that relationship?
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.200]   Is it that promotion?
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.040]   Is it a designer bag?
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.360]   Something that I don't care about at all?
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:57.600]   You know what, what is it?
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.520]   And so we say to ourselves, "I know what will make me happy.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.960]   I know what will make me content.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.320]   I know what I'm after.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.040]   That thing, this will bring me contentment."
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:17.960]   And we believe that the objects that are stirring the desire within us will also be the objects
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.440]   that will bring the contentment.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.980]   Let me give you an example.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:29.840]   When I was younger, living in Germany, Nike or Nike, you know, some people call it Nike,
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.680]   shoes were expensive.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.560]   And they were really something special.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.720]   Not everyone had those, but some of my friends had them.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.560]   They played basketball.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.160]   And I really wanted a pair of Nikes, some Nike shoes.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.920]   And I thought if I have them, you know, it's going to feel great.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.320]   I'm going to be a better basketball player.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.880]   And I'm going to be a little bit cooler.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.680]   And so there was the object that stirred this desire in my heart.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:02.280]   And I thought that somehow these shoes will make me feel better.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.240]   And they did.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.960]   But just for a little while, right?
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.160]   Just for a little while.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.440]   And then I thought, "Oh, it's not the shoes.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.600]   It's this other thing."
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:19.320]   And so the question is, you know, is that really true about these things that we say
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.640]   will bring us contentment?
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.520]   Is it really true?
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:30.800]   The things that you're looking for, that you think will make you all right, are those really
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:38.040]   the things that make us all right?
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.280]   Now I did get those shoes.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.680]   And I think some of us have reached some of our goals, achieved perhaps some of our dreams
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.320]   along the way.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.760]   And it does feel good.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.780]   There's no denying of that.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:56.240]   But then what happens is we reach this goal, and then we turn around, and we say, "You
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.720]   know what?
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.400]   It wasn't this thing, but it's this other thing that will make me content."
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:11.040]   And then we focus our energy on this other thing that we don't have yet.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:17.520]   So being content is like, you know, I'm trying to reach for this thing, but I struggle to
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.280]   ever really arrive.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.840]   I'm just not getting there.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.940]   It's just always around the corner.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.440]   It slips through my hands.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:37.880]   But yet, you know, I'm feeling this longing to just be whole, to be at peace about all
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:43.340]   the things that are going on in my life.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.080]   And so we seek to find contentment in things.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:53.120]   Now in verse 12, Paul shows us what true contentment looks like.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.920]   It means being content in all of life's circumstances.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.800]   So there's a true contentment, there's a false contentment.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.920]   True contentment means, you know, whatever happens, it doesn't matter.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:12.880]   I can know peace, I can know joy, I can know satisfaction, regardless of what happens.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:19.600]   But a false contentment is exposed, and Paul talks about plenty and want.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.600]   When we experience plenty and want, that sort of shows of the contentment that we're experiencing
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.160]   if it's the real deal.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:36.400]   Or if something happens and whatever circumstances change, are we really going to be content?
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:42.240]   So the way you can tell you have real contentment is if you can handle plenty and want.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.360]   But there is actually a problem with that.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:52.000]   Because a lot of times, well, some of us never experience want.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.920]   Like we've always in our lives actually had a certain level of things and cares.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:04.140]   We never hit really the point where we're just struggling for existence.
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.000]   But some of us have experienced that.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.320]   You know, we know want.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:15.520]   And we've just hit rock bottom, or we're in a very difficult place.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.080]   But I believe that most of us have not experienced plenty.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:26.160]   Where really in a very major substantial way, our dreams come actually true.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:33.040]   Where we get the influence, the power, the finances, the whatever it is that you dream
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:41.440]   of, that you just have that in such a crazy abundance, that you actually find out, even
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.400]   if I have all these things, they still don't make me content.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.080]   Now, Jim Carrey, some of you know him.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.740]   By now it's a little bit maybe for older generation already.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:58.320]   So he was or is a Canadian actor, comedian.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.960]   Back in the '90s, 2000s, was movies.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.220]   I don't know if he still does movies or not.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.220]   But he said this.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.320]   So somebody who has reached plenty, he says this.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:12.200]   I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:18.720]   they can see that it's not the answer.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:25.120]   Even if you reach this point, it actually does not make you content.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.720]   But most of us never get there.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.880]   And so the problem is maybe we taste a little bit of it.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.720]   And so we actually still believe that those things will make us content.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.760]   Because we just experience a little bit of the dream.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:44.640]   And we're like, if I just manage to do a little bit more, then I'm going to be content.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:53.480]   And so we actually buy into this lie.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.640]   But what if we actually do experience plenty and want?
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   What are some of the responses?
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.960]   Well, there's three -- I want to suggest three ways that people respond to it.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.680]   The first one is they reach their dream.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.800]   It is fulfilled.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.520]   It's amazing.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.240]   But then after a little while, it wears off.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.240]   And they're like, you know what?
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.720]   Actually, this was not my dream.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.840]   This thing here is my dream.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.680]   You know, that relationship, that didn't make me happy.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.520]   This other relationship is going to really make me happy.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.840]   And so then they shift it.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.520]   They're like, oh, I was wrong about this.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.200]   But I know I'm right about this.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.440]   So that's one response.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.760]   Another one is that actually we grow cynical.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:39.680]   Like where you reach this -- you know, your dream, and you're like, you know, I've tried
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:47.280]   so hard to be content, but I'm -- I feel like the universe is messing with me.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.400]   Because even if I have all these things, I just don't feel good.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.760]   I think this world is just a joke.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.560]   And so this is actually a very dark place to be in; right?
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.040]   A very cynical place.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.000]   So that's a conclusion that people draw.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.200]   But then there's a third thing.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.960]   And that's, of course, what I want to suggest to you.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:11.640]   Is that actually this longing for being content and looking for it in things, that it actually
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:18.200]   is something that points us towards God.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:25.160]   You know, that there is something in this universe that can fulfill these deep longings.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:33.280]   And that we can find that in a personal relationship with Jesus.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.880]   And so this is actually a story of C.S. Lewis.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:43.840]   C.S. Lewis, he was an English professor at Oxford and Cambridge University.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:51.840]   He writes about his journey of coming to faith in the book "Surprised by Joy."
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.300]   And it's actually his longing.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.160]   He calls it "Sehnsucht," which is German, which makes me happy.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:03.680]   You know, this longing that he felt was actually what brought him on his journey of finding
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.660]   faith.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.360]   That there must be something else.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.480]   And so he wrote in "Mere Christianity," one of his most well-known books, he wrote this
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.480]   quote.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:18.200]   And he's talking about that because we have this longing, it is something that points
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   us to God.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   So let me read this to you.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:26.080]   "Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.160]   A baby feels hunger, well, there's such a thing as food.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.240]   A duckling wants to swim, well, there's such a thing as water.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.520]   Men feel sexual desire, well, there's such a thing as sex.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:52.560]   If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:57.480]   explanation is that I was made for another world.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.440]   If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.440]   fraud."
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.480]   So in other words, it does not prove the cynical view.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:13.040]   All the earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.080]   the real thing.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:21.760]   So in other words, our longing and desire for being content, they point us to God.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:26.600]   You know, that there is someone out there who can fulfill this deep longing and desire
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:32.800]   in our hearts, and who can meet that, that it doesn't matter what the circumstances are,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.440]   we can find wholeness, we can find peace, we can find strength, we can find joy, we
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.040]   can find satisfaction, you know, in him.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:49.880]   And this is actually also where Paul is moving in the letter to Philippians in verse 13.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:59.440]   So he says this, he says, "I can do all of this through him who gives me strength."
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:06.840]   So out of this relationship with Jesus, he can face plenty and want, because it's Jesus
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:13.200]   who gives him the power and the strength to cope with whatever comes his way.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.780]   Now this is not denying that there are real challenges.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.520]   This is not a spirituality where we need to, "Oh, you know, everything's great," and it's
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.160]   not.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:29.600]   But Paul is just saying, you know, he can face those things by the power of Jesus, and
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:38.360]   he can know peace, he can know joy in the midst of all of that.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.680]   And so in contrast to like self-sufficiency or self-reliance, Paul says, "I am strong
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:52.580]   enough because of Jesus, who is my strength, and I can face this, I can get through this."
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:58.520]   And so part of my heart for us today is actually I believe that Jesus wants to give us confidence
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   in him.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.760]   Because sometimes we lose confidence in Jesus, even as Christians, and we kind of try to
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.480]   hedge our bets and like, maybe this other thing is actually what does really satisfy
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.400]   me.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.880]   And that Jesus wants to give us confidence and know it is him and him that we find our
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.880]   satisfaction.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:24.100]   It is he who will give us the grace and the strength to be at peace in very difficult
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:31.980]   situations and experience, you know, his love and to even have joy that the Holy Spirit
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:37.860]   gives, you know, in those circumstances, even if it doesn't make any sense to people around
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.860]   us.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:44.340]   It's like just a little bit earlier in the chapter, Paul talks about that we can come
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:50.460]   to Jesus and he gives us a peace that surpasses all understanding, the peace of God, that
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.740]   he bestows that on his people.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:02.940]   And so God wants to release his confidence in Jesus that we can face whatever it is that
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.420]   we're facing, whatever it is that we're going through, that he can be our strength.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:12.420]   I can do all of this through him who gives me strength.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:17.580]   So that we all can say that and we all not just say it, but actually can know that I
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:23.100]   can do all things, all of this through him who gives me strength.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:31.740]   Now, it's interesting that Paul, he talks about also that he learned to be content.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.980]   He actually repeats that multiple times in the passage.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.860]   And so there is a thing of like that this doesn't just fall in our laps, but it is actually
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:48.060]   as we live life, as we face these challenges and as we struggle with and learn to trust
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:57.020]   Jesus with what's going on, as we do that, we experienced that he meets us in that struggle.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:01.820]   And he does it every time because he is faithful.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.700]   Every time.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.020]   But we struggle and that's the truth, right?
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.060]   Like we struggle to actually trust him.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.820]   Very often we don't come to him.
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.920]   We try to deal with what's going on in different ways.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:21.100]   But Paul over his lifespan, he learned to continuously come to Jesus.
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.100]   This can be on our own.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.220]   This can also be with others that pray with us, that help us.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:33.400]   You know, and where we entrust what's going on and when we find rest, that God is sovereign
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:40.820]   over our circumstances, that he is Lord and he is with us and he will see us through whatever
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.480]   it is that we're facing.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:53.040]   And then suddenly the peace of God, you know, falls on us and we get to experience that
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.320]   even in the most difficult and challenging circumstances.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:03.780]   Now, a little bit later in the letter, Paul, he continues to encourage the Philippians
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:10.980]   and he says this in Philippians 4 verse 19, he says, "And my God will meet all your needs
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:16.900]   according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus."
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.900]   And I love this.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:24.060]   He's like, "My God, my God can do that for you."
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:29.700]   He's speaking from personal experience because he experienced it for himself.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:36.380]   So he knows that because God has done this for him, he can also do it for you.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:44.620]   My God can meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.840]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:54.680]   So Paul is saying we can learn to be content as we walk with Jesus, as we continuously
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:02.340]   place our trust in Jesus, you know, and as we experience him meeting us in these circumstances
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.060]   and he wants to build our confidence.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.060]   He wants us to know that he is faithful.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:12.900]   We're unfaithful, we struggle, but he is faithful and he is with you and he will walk with you
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:18.660]   through whatever it is that you're going on and he will give you peace.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:25.980]   He can release joy and even satisfaction when it doesn't make sense that your contentment
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:34.500]   does not depend on external circumstances.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:39.140]   Does that sound good?
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:47.020]   And I, you know, in my own life, I've shared some struggles here before and so I'm also
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.060]   not somebody who easily just preaches this, who has never experienced anything difficult
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:55.820]   or challenging in his life.
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:01.200]   You know, I've experienced when I hit my own rock bottom, when the rug was pulled from
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:10.380]   underneath my feet and my job, a relationship, my home, you know, all of this was gone.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.980]   Now I wrestled, I wasn't right away content and I've experienced it.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.300]   It was like I prayed once and then, oh, now I'm content.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.020]   Okay, it's all good.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:26.820]   You know, but it was a wrestling and we're talking about months, but Jesus met me and
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:32.140]   he gave me confidence that it is he who sees us through, through whatever struggle, whatever
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.720]   difficulty you're experiencing.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:41.060]   And if my God can do it for me, he can also do it for you.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.060]   Amen.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:55.980]   So I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:04.000]   You know, it's a, as I've been sharing, it is in this personal relationship with Jesus
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.260]   that we find true contentment.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.940]   You know, that's where we find peace.
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:18.100]   That's where we find rest for our souls.
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:23.900]   And I know it's easy to, you know, to come to church and I don't know everyone's backgrounds.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:29.980]   You know, some of you, maybe you're a Christian, some of you maybe are not, but as one of the
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.020]   responses we'll have, I'll give different ways of responding to this message.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:40.140]   One of them, I just simply want to ask, you know, is there anyone here that wants to invite
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.020]   Jesus into their lives?
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:51.140]   You know, that says like, Hey, I've, I've experienced this discontent and I just, I
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:57.940]   just want to experience this Jesus who meets people and their challenges.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:02.420]   And you know, if that's you, if you want to invite Jesus in your life and just a moment,
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.780]   I'm going to give an opportunity to, but actually you want to ask, can we turn on the lights
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:16.680]   a little bit and can we actually close our eyes if that's okay.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.820]   So I want to ask if there, if there's anyone, maybe for a while you've been thinking about
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.140]   this, taking the step of faith.
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:29.900]   I want to ask if there's anyone who wants to take the step and if you do want to ask
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:40.620]   you to maybe just give me a little wave.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.180]   So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say a prayer.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:48.340]   I'm going to say a phrase, you know, by phrase and give you space where you can follow it.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:52.260]   And it's through this prayer that we say, Jesus come into my life.
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:56.020]   Want to be a Christian and you can make this your own prayers.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:00.140]   I'm going to pray a line and then you can repeat and I'll pray another line and then
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.500]   you can repeat.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.220]   And so why don't we do this now?
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:14.340]   Jesus, I'm sorry that I have sinned against you and have sinned against other people.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:28.420]   Jesus, thank you that you died for my sins on the cross, that you forgive me.
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:35.220]   I place my trust in you.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:39.740]   Will you come into my life?
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:45.060]   Will you fill me with your Holy Spirit?
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:51.660]   And will you show me what it means to know you and what it means to live my life for
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.700]   you?
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.820]   Amen.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:03.620]   Now, if you've prayed this prayer, God's word says if we confess with our tongue that Jesus
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.460]   Christ is Lord, you know, we are saved.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:12.740]   And I would love to help you and, you know, take further steps.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.700]   So afterwards I'll be up front here.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:19.340]   You can come and we'd just like to guide you more so you know, you know how to move forward
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.220]   in this journey.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:28.220]   But right now, what I want to do is as I shared, even as Jesus followers, even as Christians,
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:32.940]   you know, we struggle with discontent and a lot of times our hearts, you know, we get
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:33.940]   unsure.
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:34.940]   Can Jesus really help?
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:38.140]   And so we place our trust in other things, in idols.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.340]   You know, we think this thing will make me happy.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.340]   That's an idol.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:45.980]   Whatever you think will make you fulfilled and content besides God, you know, that's
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.820]   an idol.
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:55.060]   And I want to actually just create a space for us to turn to each other.
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.460]   Maybe somebody you came with, maybe somebody sitting next to you and you ask them if they're
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:07.260]   open to praying with you and just pray that the God will meet you, you know, in this area
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:14.180]   of discontent, that he will give you confidence in him, that he is powerful, that he's able
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.980]   to see you through whatever it is that's going on.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:22.300]   And so I want to just give space for five minutes or so to pray with each other.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.020]   It's also okay if you want to just pray on you and you can say, tell the person, "Hey,
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.020]   I just want to pray in a moment."
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.020]   That's okay.
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.700]   But why don't we do that right now as a church?
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.660]   We'll just take time to pray with each other.
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.280]   So turn to each other.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   Let's pray for one another.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.740]   Let's pray that God meets us in the areas we're struggling to trust him, struggling
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.580]   to be confident in him, and just ask him to meet us.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.580]   So let's do this right now.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.620]   And then in about five minutes or so, I'll come back and I'll pray for us.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.620]   Amen.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:46.620]   Amen.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.620]   Amen.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:53.620]   Amen.

[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:18.620]   Jesus, you've heard the cry of our hearts.
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:23.620]   Will you instill faith and trust in you in our hearts?
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:28.620]   Will you release faith on your people?
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:33.620]   Will you lead us into places where there's right now pain,
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:38.620]   there's difficulty, we're just overwhelmed?
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.620]   Will you give us confidence?
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:43.620]   Will you help us see that you are sovereign over the situation,
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.620]   that you stand above it, that you are with us,
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:53.620]   that we are not alone, that all power belongs to you,
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.620]   that you love us, and you do not withhold your goodness from us,
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:01.620]   that you will meet us in those places of need?
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.620]   Strengthen your people.
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.620]   Strengthen our hearts.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.620]   And allow us to be content in whatever comes our way,
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.620]   because you are with us, because we know you.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.620]   So I pray this in your name, Jesus.
