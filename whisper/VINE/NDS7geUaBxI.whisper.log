[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   A while back, actually it's a long time ago, I was in a conflict.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   It wasn't one of those conflicts where one time something happens,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   but it was a conflict that just kind of kept meandering along.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   One thing happens, another thing happens, and another thing happens.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   They make you upset.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And I got to the point where I was just fed up. I had it. I had enough.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   So this person was so rude, so inconsiderate, you know, how dare they.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   And I don't know, I can't remember exactly what happened,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   but I was challenged, either by a friend or through a book or something I was doing,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   I was challenged to pray a prayer of blessing over this person.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And I was like, that is the last person that I want to pray a prayer of blessing over.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I didn't want to do it. But eventually I did it anyhow.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   So I prayed for this person, and I was having problems with a blessing over them.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And I don't remember how many times I prayed this,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   but at one time while I was praying, the Holy Spirit suddenly highlighted to me
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and gave me insights into a lot of pain and difficulties that this person had gone through.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And that really allowed me to have a different level of compassion and care,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   because it provided context for how they were acting towards me.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Now, don't get me wrong, I still believe that as adults we are responsible for how we act,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   and we need to own our actions and everything,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   but it still was helpful to understand the context,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   and it gave me a lot of compassion and care.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And eventually it really changed my outlook on the person.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I started looking at the person in a different way.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Now, what had happened?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Well, instead of looking at the person through my human wisdom and my human understanding,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   when I prayed, God gave me spiritual sight.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   He let me see this other person through his eyes instead of just seeing them through my eyes.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And that was so powerful, because it allowed me to suddenly be more patient,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   to show more grace, to be more understanding,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   but then also eventually to be able to forgive and to really just move forward.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   You know, it's amazing, right?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   When God gives us spiritual sight, when he gives us a faith perspective,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   how we suddenly can navigate something where we only had one way of looking at it,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   we're suddenly able to navigate it differently, and it can make all the difference.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Now, we all in our lives, in big ways and in small ways, we have situations, circumstances,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   where we're looking right now at them from a human perspective, with human wisdom,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and that's okay, because we're human, and we should use our human perspective,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   we should use our human wisdom.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   But I really have a sense, as I was writing this sermon series and preparing this for us,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   that God wants to give us spiritual sight this year,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   that he wants to give us a deeper faith perspective of what he's doing, of what is going on,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   so that instead of just seeing the things through our limited lens,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   that we can have a fuller perspective, that we can understand what God is doing,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   that we can face, if it's a challenge, that we can face the challenge with hope,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   with courage, with perspective and trust in him,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   or if it's an opportunity, because it can also be positive things, right?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   That we also know how to walk, how God is leading, and what he wants us to do.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And so I want to explore with you the following question, that's this.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   How can I cultivate spiritual sight in approaching and understanding my life?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   How can I gain a greater faith perspective?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   How can I more consistently see things through the eyes of faith?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And how in the world do you do that?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   What does that look like?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And how might God invite you to have deeper spiritual sight this year?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   So I'm excited about this.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   We're continuing in our sermon series, Bold in Prayer.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Last week we looked at Matthew 9, where we talked about that Jesus,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   as he was seeing the crowds and was seeing their needs,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   and they were helpless, and they were at rest,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   he invited the disciples to pray for the Lord of the harvest to send out,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   to cast out, to thrust out workers into the harvest field.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And I really believe that part of that is, part of that thrusting out,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   is that actually God also gives us different spiritual sight,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   so that we start looking at our days, at our routines,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   at the people around us in different ways,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   and we can understand where he's at work,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   and where he's inviting us to partner with him in the work that he is doing.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   So that's what we looked at last week.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Today we are in 2 Kings.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I want to provide a little bit of context for you,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   and I'm going to start by looking at a map that I stole from Pastor Ivan,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   that he used this morning.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I was like, "Oh, this makes it a lot easier to explain what I want to explain,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   so let me use the same map."
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So 2 Kings, to give a little bit of context,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   since we are not consistently right now walking through the book of 2 Kings.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So first, there's a reign of King Solomon, and also the demise of that.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   There's a separation of Israel being one nation to being two kingdoms,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Judah and Israel, so the southern kingdom, the northern kingdom.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   We're going to pick things up around the 9th century before Christ,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   where the prophet Elisha, he is in Dothan.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I want to say Gotham, but it's Dothan.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   You know, Germans have problems with T-H.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Dothan.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   We're also going to be looking at Samaria,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   which was the capital of the northern kingdom.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It's King Jehoram, Israel's king.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   He's actually not even mentioned in the passage,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   but we're going to look at by name.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Let me go to the other side.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And then we're going to look at King from Aram,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   who was raiding, attacking, warring with Israel.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So this is the broad context.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   There's a lot more going on, but I think that gives you a little bit of an idea
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   of what's going on.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   So let me take you to 2 Kings 6, where starting in verse 8, it says this.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   "Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   After conferring with his officers, he said,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   'I will set up my camp in such and such a place.'"
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I think it's very cool that the Bible uses the word "such and such."
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Verse 9.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "The man of God sent word to the king of Israel,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   'Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there.'
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Time and time again, Elisha warned the king
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   so that he was on his guard in such places.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Now he sent a raid to the king of Aram.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   He summoned his officers and the men of them,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   'Tell me which of us is on the side of the king of Israel.'
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   'None of us, my lord,' said one of his officers.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   'But Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   tells the king of Israel the very words he speaks in your bedroom.'
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   'Go find out where he is,' the king ordered.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   'I can send men and capture him.'
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   The report came back, 'He is in Dothan.'
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   and they went by night and surrounded the city."
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   So we're told the king of Aram, he's picking a fight,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   he's warring against Israel,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   he makes all these amazing plans with his officers in the war room.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   But for whatever reason, his plans are always thwarted.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   The king of Israel is always able to avoid him.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   They're not able to catch him, they're just always able to escape.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And so the king realizes, this is beyond coincidence.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   One time, okay, two times, okay, three times, okay, four times, come on.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Who's the leak? Who's the mole?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And so then he's told that it's not any of his officers,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   but it's a prophet, Elijah,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   and that he knows the very words that are spoken in the bedroom of the king,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   which is very creepy.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   But what that means is if Elijah, the prophet,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   knows what is spoken in the bedroom, that means he knows everything.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   He can hear everything, he can perceive everything.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   God has given him supernatural sight, supernatural insight
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   into what's going on.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And so the king of Aram decides we're going to go after him,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   but I just want to highlight a contrast here.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   The king of Aram has no idea where Elijah is
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   while Elijah knows everything about the king of Aram.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So he even needs to send out a spy to figure out where he is
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   to send someone there.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And so then he sends the troops, horses, chariots,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   that would be the equivalent of the most modern military equipment there is.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   I have no idea what the most modern military equipment is.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I assume it's like drones and helicopters and things.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   But they're sending their special forces there.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   And that's a bit of overkill for catching one person.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   But the king is so frustrated that he's fully going for it.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Let's continue in verse 15.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   "And when a servant of the man of God got up and went out early in the morning,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   'Oh no, my lord, what shall we do?'
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   The servant asked. 'Don't be afraid,' the prophet answered.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   'Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.'
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And Elijah prayed, 'Open his eyes, lord, so that he may see.'
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Then the lord opened the servant's eyes, and he looked,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   and he saw his hills full of horses and chariots of fire around Elijah."
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   So now instead of seeing things from the Arameans' perspective,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   now the narrative shifts,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and we get to see things from Elijah and his servant's perspective.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   We get to see things from their point of view.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Elijah's servant gets up, he steps outside,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   and oh my gosh, oh no.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   That's what he says, oh no.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   They are surrounded by enemy forces.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Like I said, it's the most modern military equipment,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   so this is intimidating, this is scary.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   He is freaked out.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And so he calls out, "Oh no, my lord, what shall we do?"
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   So he calls out to the man of God,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   who also, of course, indirectly represents God, Elijah.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Like, "Oh no, what shall we do?"
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Now it would be easy to just pass over this really quickly,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   this 'oh no' moment.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   But when you and I go through an 'oh no' moment,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   it doesn't usually just pass quickly.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   It actually really occupies us, we're really challenged with this,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and so I don't want us just to pass over it quickly.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Because the truth is that there is something
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   that every one of us, at one point or another,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   we feel surrounded, we feel fenced in,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   we are overwhelmed by the challenges that are going on in our lives,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   where we also, like the servant Elijah, have an 'oh no' moment.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Where there are things we see,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   and we do not know the way out, we do not know what to do,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   we have no answer, we have no way forward.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   So that is what the servant Elijah is seeing.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   He's seeing enemy forces on the hills,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   they're surrounded, and they're about to get them.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   And so then he calls out to Elijah.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And Elijah responds, "Don't be afraid.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Those who are with us are more than those who are with them."
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Now, I have a question for you.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   If you're overwhelmed, if you are freaked out
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   about the challenges in your life,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   and somebody just tells you, "Don't be afraid."
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   How do you feel about that?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Might be annoying, right? Let's be honest.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And we do that a lot in church, right?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   We tell each other things are true,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   but sometimes we just don't want to hear them.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   "Don't be afraid." He's like,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   "How can you tell me not to be afraid?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   There's like horses and chariots all around us,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   and we're about to be in enemy's arms,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   we're about to be taken captive.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Like, what in the world are you talking about?
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Elijah, are you crazy?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And by the way, what do you mean
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   that those who are with us are more than those who are with them?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   What do you mean by that? What does it even mean?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Who are you talking about?"
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   That's probably how I would have reacted.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And so what Elijah's servant doesn't know
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   is that Elijah has spiritual sight.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   He's able to see what is going on around him,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   not just from a human perspective,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   but from a supernatural perspective.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   He understands how God is at work in the moment,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   and that makes all the difference.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And so he prays for his servant's eyes to be opened.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   So in verse 17 it says, "And Elijah prayed,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   'Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.'
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   and he looked, and he saw the hills full of horses
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   and chariots of fire all around Elijah."
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   So Elijah prayed for spiritual sight for his servant,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   and God opened his servant's eyes,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   and he suddenly was able to see the circumstances,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   the situation that he's in, that he's facing,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   from a completely different perspective.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   While just a moment ago he's crying, "Oh, no,"
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   and he's overwhelmed, and there seems to be no way out,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   now his eyes are opened, and he sees those who are with us
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   are more than those who are with them.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And he sees the chariots of fire, he sees the heavenly hosts,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   the heavenly army outnumbering the enemy
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   that is there to get him.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Wow!
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   What a perspective, and what a change in perspective.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   And you know, the words, "Do not be afraid that he spoke,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   that at first might seem annoying."
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Now that his eyes are open, "Oh, I do not have to be afraid."
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Because these words of "Do not be afraid,"
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   they're not just wishful thinking.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   They're actually based in the reality of who God is
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   and what God is doing.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Can I get an amen? Come on. Amen. Yes.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And so he does not have to be afraid.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And you know, this is true for us as Christians,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   because what we see is not everything that is going on.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   There is a spiritual reality.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Psalm 34 verse 7 says, "Know that the angel of the Lord
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   encamps around those who fear him."
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   So if you're walking with God, the angel of the Lord
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   surrounds you and encamps you.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   God is with us. You know, we are not alone.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   He is for us. And that's another thing in the situation.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   It's not just that he gets to see, but it also means that
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   God is with Elisha and his servant.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   They are not alone, and neither are you and I.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   We are not alone. God is with us, and he is for us,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   even more than we can imagine or think.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   So God is for you, and he's greater and more powerful
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   than you can think or imagine.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I mean, I don't know about you, when you walk around
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   through your day, if you have in mind who God is constantly
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   in all his fullness and all his glory and all his power
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   and all his majesty and all his love.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I don't. I want to, but truth be told, I don't.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   So God is more powerful, more loving, more caring
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   than you and I can imagine.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And he is at work in our lives, just as he is at work
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   in the life of Elisha and his servant in this moment.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   But let's continue and see what happens.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Verse 18, "As the enemy came down toward him,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Elisha prayed to the Lord, 'Strike this army with blindness.'
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Elisha told him, 'This is not the road, and this is not the city.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for.'
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And he led them to Samaria.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   So after they entered the city, Elisha said,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   'Lord, open the eyes of these men so that they can see.'
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   And the Lord opened their eyes, and they looked,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   and they were inside Samaria."
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Now remember, Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   They're inside the capital of the enemy.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And Elisha had led them there.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   So we're told that Elisha prayed a second time, so they do attack.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   So just because we know who God is, that he's powerful and great,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   doesn't mean that we still go through whatever challenge we're facing,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   but we can walk through it differently because we know the power of God,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   we know who God is, and so we can face it differently.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   So as they are coming at him, he prays, and God answers his prayer,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   and he strikes them with blindness.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Now what's interesting is, and I didn't catch this on multiple readings,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   only after I read some commentaries and things,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   is that actually the blindness that is talking about here is not physical blindness.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   What do you mean not physical blindness?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Well, the Hebrew word that is used here, "sanverim,"
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   it's a very rare word.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   It's not the normal word that is used for blindness.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It's actually only used three times, twice in this passage, once in Genesis.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And it means blindness, dazzling, and deception.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And so in NIV it's translated as blindness,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   but if we look at the context, I think we can see that something else is going on.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Elisha asks them to follow him,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   that he's going to lead them to who they're looking for.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   How can they follow him if they can't see?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   And this is still, I think it's like 11 miles or something like that,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   so it's still quite a stretch.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And then suddenly he's telling them,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   "Oh, this is not the road and this is not the city."
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   They were just looking at the city.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   They were just on the road.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Just because you're physically blind suddenly doesn't mean that somebody can tell you
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   this is not the road, this is not the city.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   So something has changed in the perception.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   They have distorted perception.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   God has blinded them from the reality of the situation that they're in.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And so then Elisha is able to lead them into the city,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   into Samaria, which is the hub of Israel,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   into the enemy from the Arameans' perspective, the enemy of Seraturi.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And then he prays for them again and their eyes are open,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   and now they can see where they're at.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   And that's for them an "Oh no" moment.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   So earlier we had the "Oh no" moment for Elijah's servant,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   now we have the "Oh no" moment for the Aramean soldiers.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Let's continue in verse 21 and see what happens.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   "So when the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elijah,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   'Shall we kill them? My father, shall I kill them?'"
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   He's very eager.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   "'Do not kill them,' he answered.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   'Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow?
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Set food and water before them, so that they may eat and drink,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   and then go back to their master.'
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   So he prayed a great feast for them,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   and after they had finished eating and drinking,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   he sent them away and they returned to their master,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   so that bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel's territory."
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I can only imagine what it must have been like,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   as these soldiers, as their eyes are opened,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   and they're like, "Oh my goodness, no, we're in enemy territory,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   we're surrounded, and there's a king who's drooling
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   over the opportunity to kill them."
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   But since they were not the king's prisoners,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   they were Elijah's prisoners, he actually, I believe,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   also through spiritual sight, through what God had revealed to him,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   he shows them mercy and grace, and that then allows them
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   that this conflict, at least for a while, actually does continue eventually,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   but for a while this conflict ends between Israel and Aram.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Now, this whole passage is, there's two dynamics that I want to highlight.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   The first one is, that it's all about sight.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Elijah sees and knows the plans, and knows what's going on,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   and what they want to do, and the king of Aram, he doesn't know,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   he doesn't have sight.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Then the military, they surround Elijah and his servant,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   and the servant doesn't have sight, and then God gives him sight,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   and then they take away, so as you see, it's all about vision,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   and seeing and not seeing, and this brings me to a second point,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   is all of this also shows that God is sovereignly over the situation.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   There are politics going on, there are world powers,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   or regional powers here in this case, fighting,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   but God is sovereign in the midst of this conflict,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   and is working out his purposes, and what he desires,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   what he wants, comes to pass.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And there's a third thing I actually want to highlight to you too,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   and that is that, is the relationship between Elijah and God,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   because we see Elijah pray three times, open his eyes, blind them,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   open their eyes, and Elijah is walking in this relationship with God,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   and that's why he has spiritual sight about what's going on.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Now, of course, this leaves us at the point of asking the question,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   what does all of this mean for us?
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   This brings us also back to the earlier question that I asked,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   how can we cultivate spiritual sight in approaching and understanding our lives?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   How can we start not just looking at our circumstances,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   our challenges, from a human perspective,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   which we again still should, because God has made us and given us that,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   we should use our human reason and wisdom and all of those things,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   but how can we also look at things with spiritual sight,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   with eyes of faith, or see things through the eyes of God?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Now, how do you do that?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Well, there's three things I want to highlight.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   The first one is, this really happens through a relationship with Jesus.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Now, if you want to have spiritual sight, if you want to understand what God is doing,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   if you want to see beyond just the physical reality, you need to know Jesus,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   because when you become a Christian, actually even talks about it,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   when you move from darkness to light or from spiritual blindness to sight,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   it's part of how the Bible describes even conversion or coming to faith,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   you gain a different perception, a different perspective of reality,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   because now you can see things through eyes of faith.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   You can see that Jesus really is the Savior, that he is God's Son,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   that he did die, that he did rise, that he is powerful over death, over sin,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   that he is able to forgive us, and you can now see this because you are a Christian.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   But then just because we're a Christian doesn't mean that we always have spiritual sight.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   I mean, earlier I was telling a story of me, I was in this conflict,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   and I was not having spiritual sight.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   I was having just my human perspective of what was going on.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   And so we need to nurture our relationship with God to develop the sight.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And so as our relationship and intimacy with God grows, so does your spiritual sight grow.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   So if you want to have spiritual sight, we need to invest time in our relationship with God,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   which we're doing right now through this fasting season,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   coming before God with our fasting, with prayer, with reading of Scripture, with worship,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   or whatever else you're doing.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   But then the second thing is that the way we gain more sight is through God's Word,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   because God's Word is God's revelation to us.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   It's how he has shown us who he is, how powerful, how mighty.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   He has shown us his love.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   He shows us his purposes that he has for us through his Word.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   And so if we don't know his Word, we have limited sight.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   But as we get to know God's Word, he wants to give us more of a faith perspective,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   because we know God's revelation more, and we can see things differently.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   We can see things through a lens of faith.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Now, as I was thinking this through, I was reminded of Psalm 119, 105.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   "Your Word is a lamp for my feet and a light on my path."
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   It's like we're walking around in darkness, because we're not seeing everything.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   But as we go into God's Word and the Holy Spirit illuminates God's Word to us,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   we can start seeing who God is.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   He speaks to us even directly about things that are going on, gives us an understanding.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   And it's like light on a path.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Like before you're walking in darkness, now as you're getting to know God more through his Word,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   it's like your path lights up, you're more clear on where to walk and what to do.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   And so if you want to grow in sight, you need to spend time in God's Word.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And he wants to light up your path in the way that he has for you,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   whether it's in challenges, whether it's an opportunity, whether that's with your dreams.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   But he will light up your path, and he will show you a way.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   So for some of us here, this might be one thing that God is inviting you this year,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   to go deeper into his Word.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And when we read God's Word, we can ask the Holy Spirit to illuminate it,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   to help us understand his Word, to show us what it means for us.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And he does that. He loves doing that.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   So that is the second important thing.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   That's one way that we live out that relationship is through his Word,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   as we come to his Word and ask God to help us understand and spend time.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   So we gain spiritual sight by getting to know God's Word,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   and the Holy Spirit illumining God's Word to us.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   And finally, we cultivate spiritual sight and approaching and understanding our life through prayer.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And that's really what the passage really focuses on.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   It's this praying relationship with Elisha and between Elisha and God,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   and where he's able to see things because he prays.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Prayer is how God gives us spiritual eyes to see what we otherwise would not see.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   So if we're not praying, there's things you're not going to see.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   God only opens those up when we pray, when we come to him and ask him.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Just like Elijah asked for his servant's eyes to be opened,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   so that he could perceive that he was not alone in the challenge that he was facing.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   But without prayer and without praying for each other,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   so I also love that it's Elisha praying for Elisha's servant,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   without praying for each other and without prayer,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   we're not going to have spiritual sight.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   We're going to not be able to see things as clearly as they are.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   We're not going to be able to perceive all of the reality,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   all of what God is doing in circumstance.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   But when we pray, God gives us a vision.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   He gives us sight and helps us to see things we're otherwise not seeing.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And so invited to pray.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Now, I wanted to share, I already shared earlier the story about praying
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   and God giving me eyes to see this conflict differently.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   And in the end to be able to resolve it, right?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   So that was the first thing.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   But I want to share something actually that's just church plant.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Now, in 2022, that's when we announced in one try,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   in the church that sent us here, the Vine,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   we announced that we're going to be planting this church.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   And then we started meeting as a church plant team with like 30 people twice a month.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   And so we're gathering together, but we're in one try,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   but we're talking about planting in New Long.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   How in the heck is that going to work?
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   And so we decide that we're going to have a one-off barbecue
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   and Sunday service at EIS International Preschool,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   which is close to Fairview Park, I think, Sunton.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   I can't remember the exact little town.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And the day before, we actually were running an alpha at the same school.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   And I was praying, and while I was praying,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   God gave me this overwhelming sense that the next day,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   God was going to give us a foretaste of what this church will be like.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   That he will, so to speak, pull away the curtain
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   and give us a vision of what the Vine in New Long will be like.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And that he was giving us this vision to encourage the team, the church plant team.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Now, you have to imagine, we're not a church yet.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   We're just preparing ourselves, but nothing has happened yet.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   We're in one try, and I really had the sense that we needed encouragement.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   We needed to be able to see.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   And so God gave us, through this service, a picture of what this church could be like.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And then another thing happened.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   We had problems with this venue.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   So even though we were already paying rent for this venue,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   we couldn't do anything because we were waiting for some permits.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And so then suddenly, this one-off barbecue and this one-off service,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   suddenly we knew a way forward, because God gave us a way forward.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   We didn't know how to work. This was not part of our plan.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   But now, because God had spoken, because he had given us this picture and this experience,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   now we knew what to do.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   So in January 2023, we started meeting every week at EIS, in that preschool.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And guess what? The church started looking like that barbecue, when we had that Sunday barbecue.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   You know, so it's amazing that when we pray, that God speaks to us,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   that he reveals things to us, that he gives us guidance.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Now, this was not part of our plan.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   I did have a plan on how to plant this church.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   But, you know, you have to have a plan.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   But you also have to be ready for your plan to completely change.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And this was not our plan, and it changed.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   But through prayer, God gave us vision, and he gave us a way forward that we did not have,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   that I did not have, where I did not know what to do, but God showed us what to do.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   You know, and it's the same way that God wants to work in your and in my life,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   and when we pray, he will give us sight about things that we otherwise will not see.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   So we know how to walk, we know what to do, we gain encouragement, we gain perspective.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And so God wants to meet you when you pray.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   So we pray, so when we pray, God helps us to see things that we otherwise would not see.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Now I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   So the prophet, Elisha, he prays over the servant,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   and then that he can see, and then he says, you know, or before he does it, he tells him,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   "Those who are with us are more than those who are with them."
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Elisha's servant, he could not see it.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   And I think there's many of us right now, we're in situations where we cannot see what God is doing.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   We cannot see how that God is mighty, that he is powerful, that he is at work.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   You know, we cannot see that God is for us, that he's not against us.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And so we need to come with prayer, because we need a word from the Lord.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   We're struggling.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   We're overwhelmed, some of us.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   And God wants to give us a word, he wants to give us a perspective,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   so that we can move forward, that we are not hopeless,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   that we're not living just in anxiousness and anxiety,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   but that we can have faith that God will move with us, that he will provide with us,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   that we can have faith that he's with us, that we are not alone.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   That we can have assurance that he loves you.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   He loves you. He loves you.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   He has not given up on you. He is not finished with you.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   There is more ahead.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   And he has the power and the ability to provide.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   And just like Elisha's servant, as I was preparing his message,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   I really believe that God wants to meet us here right now in our "Oh No" moments.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Some of us are surrounded by these heavy military forces,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   and we don't know what to do.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   And we've been carrying, some of us have been carrying these "Oh No" moments from our 2024 into our 2025.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   And for some of us, these "Oh No" moments have come in 2025.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   We're like, that's not how we wanted to start this year.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   But I believe that God wants to meet you right now.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   He's inviting us to come to him in prayer and to ask him,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   "God, give me sight. Give me spiritual sight.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   I'm just, I'm drowning here. I need a word from you.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   I need you to meet me.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   I need you to give me faith. I need you to give me hope.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   I'm struggling to hold on.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   I do not know what to do."
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   And then as we come to him in prayer,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   he is going to release sight.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   He's going to give us words.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   He's going to give us images.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   He's going to put people around us.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   And he's going to show us that we are not alone,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   that he is with us, that we can make it through,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   whatever is going on, that he can lead us.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   And I also have the sense that he really wants us to know his power.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   God's power is greater than the impossible situation you are facing.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   He is more mighty, more powerful than whatever it is that you are going through.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   And he has the power and the ability to get you through it, to lead you through it.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   But not only is he powerful, he also is loving.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   He loves you. He is for you. He is not against you.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   The apostle Paul knew this.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   He experienced it himself in his own life.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   He didn't have an easy life if you read the New Testament.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   He went through many hardships, trials, unimaginably difficult things.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   And he encouraged the Roman Christians in chapter 8.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   He says, "If God is for us, who can be against us?"
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   If God is for you, who can be against you?
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Come on, people.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   So part of seeing with spiritual side is seeing how big God is.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   God is bigger than everything.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   He is bigger than the things that appear so overwhelming to us right now.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   He is bigger than your worry that you hold and that you carry.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   He is bigger than your success.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   He is bigger than your failure.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   He is bigger than the temptation that you are facing.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   God is bigger. He is more powerful.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   If He is for you, who can be against you?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   So I have a question or questions for us to reflect on.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   So what is threatening and surrounding you right now?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   What is your "Oh no" moment that you are carrying with you?
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Where do you need spiritual sight right now?
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   So church, I want to encourage you right now.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   If you need spiritual sight, actually I want to invite everyone to stand.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   If you need spiritual sight, whether it's for an opportunity, whether it's for a challenge,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   I want to encourage you to stretch out your hands right now before you.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   And I want to ask the Lord for you and pray over you. Let me pray.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Jesus, I thank you that you are mighty and powerful.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   I thank you that you are greater than any of the challenges,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   any of the circumstances that we are facing right now.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Lord, you see the outstretched hands.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   There is struggle. There is difficulty. There is challenge.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   But Lord, I pray right now by your Holy Spirit, will you come.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Holy Spirit, come. Will you move?
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Will you provide? Will you raise faith where there hasn't been faith in a long time?
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Will you pour out your love where we feel like you have not loved us, you have forgotten us?
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Lord, will you make your love known right now?
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Will you make that a lived reality?
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Where there is fear, will you speak the words of us?
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Do not be afraid because I am with you. You are not alone.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Give us eyes to see. Lord, we need you.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Give us vision. Thank you, Jesus.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Amen. Amen.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   Let's worship church.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   [music]
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Lord, I come.
