[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Well, it's good to see you all and to be back.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.840]   I am excited about Christmas.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.840]   I'm excited about introducing Christmas traditions
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.000]   to my baby girl, Ellie.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.560]   In Germany, they have a tradition.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.040]   It's a Christmas calendar,
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.400]   but it's not the chocolate calendar.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.420]   It's like it's a calendar that has big pockets
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.960]   and every day there's actually
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.260]   quite a significant gift in there.
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.600]   So I'm ready.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.920]   That's my one decoration.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.520]   (laughs)
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.640]   But anyhow, hey, it's good to see you.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.600]   Now, when I was in university,
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.940]   and I feel like I've been talking about university a lot,
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.700]   so it's like far in the past,
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.000]   I did what university students do.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.520]   I studied, I played basketball,
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.840]   and I hung out with my friends.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.340]   Now, there was one semester or one season
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.300]   where I really studied a lot,
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.280]   like all the time.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.960]   And my friends, they went on these exciting road trips.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.120]   They went to Vancouver, you know, Canada on a road trip.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.560]   They did all sorts of stuff,
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.480]   but I didn't go 'cause I needed to study,
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.140]   or I felt like I needed to study.
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.080]   And so I missed out on all these fun trips.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.340]   I missed out on hanging out with my friends.
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.240]   And when I look back at that time,
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.520]   I actually think that I chose the wrong thing
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.400]   because I should have spent time with my friends
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.240]   instead of studying.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240]   Now, I know I'm in Hong Kong.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.420]   I am aware.
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.440]   There's a lot of parents from Hong Kong here.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.040]   And I do believe studying is important.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.760]   I did study.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760]   I was a good student, so I actually got good grades,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.840]   but what I'm actually talking about
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.480]   is I studied excessively
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.440]   'cause there was a fear inside of me somehow
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   that I needed to do more in order to do well.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.500]   And it actually kept me from really enjoying my friendships,
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.000]   and it kept me from having better relationships
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.560]   with my friends.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.480]   Now, luckily, I didn't do that throughout all university,
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.620]   but I did it for a part of my studies.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.560]   But isn't that interesting how we can invest ourselves
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.800]   in the things that we think are so important
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.840]   at that moment in our lives?
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.120]   You know, you take all the time,
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.120]   you take all the energy, maybe even a lot of resources,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.920]   and then when we look back at those things,
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.360]   we realize that they really did not matter that much
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.680]   or that they're really not that important.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.560]   And so for me, it was studying excessively
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.720]   didn't improve my grades,
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.060]   lowered the quality of my friendships.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.560]   I mean, that was basically it.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.480]   For a lot of us, I believe it's working excessively, right?
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.240]   There's this saying I used to put as a screensaver
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.400]   on my phone that says,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   "Nobody ever regrets spending,"
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.260]   wait, how does it go?
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.520]   Let me get this right.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.120]   Nobody, well, let me just,
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.720]   I'm not gonna remember this.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.280]   Basically, it's the moral of the story.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.120]   How about that?
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.800]   The moral of the story is this,
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.200]   that when we're at the end of our lives,
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.000]   we never wish that we would have spent
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.200]   more time at the office.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.000]   Finally, we landed there, right?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.560]   Took me a while, but I made it, yes.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.400]   (audience applauding)
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.440]   Got a little confused there in my brain.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.720]   And the thing is, why do we work so much?
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.280]   Is it sometimes maybe it's to please someone,
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.560]   sometimes it's because we want promotion,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.520]   we're chasing after better income for our family,
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.760]   and up to a certain degree, that can be okay,
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.280]   but there is also an excessiveness
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.860]   to that a lot of times in us.
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.700]   Other ways that we might invest ourselves in things,
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.960]   maybe there's some relationships that are not that important
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   but for some reason, they absorb all our time and our energy,
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.560]   and so we give people all our time and energy
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.640]   instead of the ones that we should give it to.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.560]   Now, I don't know what you're investing yourself in,
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.840]   what you're spending your time on,
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.200]   what you're using your energy for,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.080]   but what I wanna explore with you today
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.080]   is how can we make investments that truly matter?
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.160]   How can we focus on using our energy, our resources,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.400]   our time, and put it in the place
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.600]   that actually is really important?
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.800]   So that when we look back, we don't have to say,
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.520]   "Oh my gosh, what did I do?
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.760]   "I missed out on all these fun road trips."
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.240]   You know, and we have to be bummed,
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.880]   that's quite, you know, I can get over that one,
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.960]   but there's other things, you know,
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.600]   where there can be great regrets,
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.480]   and we can miss out greatly on, of course,
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.520]   also especially what actually God has for us.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.640]   And so we're continuing in our sermon series,
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.240]   Living the Kingdom Parables.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.400]   We've been looking every week
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.600]   at one of the parables of Jesus.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.720]   Part of it, what we're looking to do
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.040]   is to be challenged by them,
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.120]   you know, for Jesus to challenge us
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.200]   in our attitudes and our thinking,
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.320]   and so that we can respond and align ourselves,
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.120]   you know, to his kingdom values,
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.640]   and we can shift our perspective,
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.080]   we can live differently in light of,
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.040]   you know, Jesus' teaching.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.400]   And so I wanna encourage us
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.360]   as we go now more into the message,
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.720]   actually to open your heart and say,
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.840]   "Lord, I wanna be challenged by you.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.520]   "I wanna hear from you what you have to say to me."
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.920]   And so, actually, let me pray for us.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.360]   Let me pray a prayer over us.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.320]   Heavenly Father, we are here
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.880]   because we wanna hear from you.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.280]   We desperately need to hear from you.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.720]   We wanna have you speak into our lives
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.680]   and say yes to what you have for us,
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.240]   because what you have is always the best.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.920]   So will you prepare our hearts now
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.680]   to receive what you have?
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.960]   I praise in your name, Jesus.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.800]   Amen. - Amen.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.080]   - So we're in the Gospel of Luke,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.560]   and I just wanna set the context
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.880]   before we go into a specific parable.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.440]   So there is, the context is,
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.840]   it actually says there's thousands of people.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.080]   Around Jesus.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.360]   And Jesus is teaching his disciples.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.400]   So it's kind of like he's teaching his disciples
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.800]   and everybody else is listening to him
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.120]   teaching his disciples.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.920]   And the topic that he's teaching on
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.640]   is actually on obstacles to discipleship,
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.360]   like things that keep you from following Jesus,
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.680]   that can derail you in your journey of being a Christian.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.720]   And the thing that Jesus talks right before we get
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.120]   to the text that we're gonna look at
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.560]   is he talks about fearing God, about fearing man,
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.960]   and he talks about being faithful to him,
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.640]   even in persecution.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.560]   You know, even when we face persecution,
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.680]   that we are faithful to Jesus.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.040]   And so then he moves to the next obstacle,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.240]   and that's where we're gonna pick up.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.760]   So we're in Luke chapter 12, starting in verse 13,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.480]   it says this.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.280]   Someone in the crowd said to him,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.240]   "Teacher, tell my brother, divide inheritance with me."
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.120]   Jesus replied, "Man, who appointed me judge
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.480]   "or an arbiter between you?"
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.040]   Then he said to them, "Watch out.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.720]   "Be on your guard against all kinds of greed.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.440]   "Life does not consist in abundance of possessions."
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.000]   So we're gonna walk through this piece by piece.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.720]   So I'm not reading everything to you right now.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.720]   But here's a man, maybe he interrupts Jesus,
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.640]   maybe he just sees the moment when Jesus is quiet
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.680]   for one second, he jumps in,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.560]   and he brings a request to Jesus.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.440]   And he asks Jesus to make a ruling over inheritance,
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.840]   I guess, fight or conflict
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.640]   that him and his brother are having.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.320]   Now, why does he come to Jesus with that?
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.440]   Well, if you notice, he addresses Jesus as a teacher.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.640]   So people around Jesus, they saw him as a teacher
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.840]   with authority, a teacher also of the law, a rabbi.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.760]   And at that time, all the rules regarding even inheritance,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.360]   they were in the Torah, they were in the first five books
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.400]   of the Bible, of the Hebrew scripture.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.920]   And so a lot of times rabbis and teachers,
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.200]   they made actually rulings, they made judgments,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.360]   and then made decisions, helped the community,
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.120]   sorted out things.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.400]   Might be a little bit like a pastor
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.440]   helping two conflicting parties settle an issue.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.160]   And what's interesting though,
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.080]   is the man that approaches Jesus,
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.960]   if we pay close attention,
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.880]   he actually doesn't ask Jesus to mediate.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.720]   He wants Jesus to do what's on his agenda.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.600]   He wants him to make a ruling that inheritance is divided.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.080]   You know, so he comes to Jesus,
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.960]   he wants Jesus to fulfill his plans, his purposes.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.280]   He's actually not interested in anything else.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.800]   He just wants Jesus to do what he wants him to do.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.800]   And one thing with that is,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   you know, that he's not interested
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.280]   in restoring his relationship with his brother.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.520]   He just wants to get his, he wants to get his inheritance.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.160]   He wants to get what he thinks is owed to him,
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.480]   and there is no room for another perspective.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.760]   He just wants Jesus to do what he wants him to do.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.680]   And Jesus, you know, being wise, being discerning,
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.320]   you know, he decides not to do a ruling,
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.840]   not to do a judging, but then instead,
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.240]   he actually turns around and he starts teaching everyone.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.000]   So not just the man who asked him a question,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.080]   not just the disciples,
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.920]   but he's speaking to the whole crowd.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.600]   And what he says to them is,
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.720]   we find in verse 15, he says,
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.160]   "Watch out, be on your guard against all kinds of greed.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.760]   "Life does not consist in abundance of possessions."
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.440]   Now just imagine yourself, you bring an issue to Jesus,
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.600]   and then Jesus uses that as a springboard
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.320]   and starts teaching everyone around you.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.120]   And he kind of implies, you know,
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.560]   that your requests involved some greed.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.280]   Makes us feel a little uncomfortable, right?
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:03.400]   But why does Jesus bring it to everyone?
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.760]   Because greed, it's a human issue.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.600]   It's actually something that not just this man
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.440]   needs to hear about,
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.440]   it's something that everyone needs to hear about.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.800]   'Cause we all, to one degree or another, have heart issues,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.440]   you know, when it comes to possessions and money
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.280]   and inheritance and all those things.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.800]   And so Jesus addresses everyone.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.520]   Now at this point in time,
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.720]   it's also important to remember
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   when Jesus addresses something like that,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.320]   he never does it to shame or to put down.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.920]   He does it because he wants to bring life,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.600]   he wants to bring wholeness
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   to an area in our lives that is broken.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.920]   He wants to do something new,
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.480]   he wants to do something better.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.920]   And so we just need to keep that in mind
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.760]   as we walk through the story.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.600]   So Jesus starts warning us against greed
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.680]   and actually false narratives that we believe.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.800]   He says in verse 15,
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.600]   "Life does not consist in abundance of possessions."
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.280]   But we actually believe that it does, right?
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.400]   We actually believe that life or abundant life
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.200]   exists in abundance of possession.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.640]   And so he's starting to address this,
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.080]   this lie, this narrative that we hold that,
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.920]   if I only have this much money,
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.280]   if I only have this house or this whatever,
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.160]   you know, then I will be okay,
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.040]   then I will live the good life.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.840]   But Jesus, you know, is saying that's not true.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.880]   You know, abundant life does not consist in these things.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:42.000]   Well, let's continue in the story, verse 16.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.160]   And he told him this parable,
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.520]   "The ground of a certain rich man
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.720]   yielded an abundant harvest.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.400]   He thought to himself, 'What shall I do?
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.160]   I have no place to store my crops.'
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.880]   Then he said, 'This is what I will do.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.520]   I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.160]   And there I will store my surplus grain.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.240]   And I'll say to myself,
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.480]   'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.200]   Take life easy, eat, drink, and be merry.'"
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.440]   Now, in this parable,
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.280]   you know, there's a rich man, we're not told why he's rich.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.560]   There's no hint that he did anything unethical.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.000]   You know, he didn't somehow do some shady, dirty deals
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.480]   and screw somebody over.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.240]   But we're just told he's wealthy.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.800]   And then there's another thing that happens.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.480]   There's an abundant harvest.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.800]   So on top of being already rich,
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.040]   his ground, you know, from whatever land he owned,
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.200]   is yielding just an absolutely incredible harvest,
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.240]   much more than expected or would be usual.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.720]   So he's already rich,
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.080]   and now he gets this extra stuff on top of it.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.560]   And this creates a challenge for him.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.680]   You know, what is he going to do with it?
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.400]   And it's interesting because we're actually let in
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.800]   on this inner dialogue in the parable
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.720]   where we can hear his thoughts.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.000]   It's kind of scary, right?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.600]   If we could hear each other's thoughts.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.920]   But we get to hear his thoughts.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.920]   So good it's that way around, not the other way around.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.840]   And we get to listen into his own inner dialogue.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.000]   And so he's like, "Oh, what am I going to do?"
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.920]   You know, with all this extra crop?
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.960]   Because there's a problem.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.640]   His barns are full.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.480]   And it's plural.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.520]   He has, you know, multiple barns.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.760]   He doesn't just have one, he has multiple ones.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.400]   And so he comes up with a solution.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.480]   I'm going to tear them down.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.200]   I'm going to do bigger ones.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.680]   I'm going to store it up.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.800]   And then he concludes the whole thing with saying that,
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.400]   you know, and when that's done,
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.840]   he can enjoy his life and leisure and eat, drink,
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.840]   and be merry.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.040]   That's his plan.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.600]   You know, that's his conversation.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.480]   And from our perspective,
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.480]   if we would not know that Jesus beforehand
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.560]   talks about greed,
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.880]   if we just would hear the story in a different context,
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.960]   we actually would be quite impressed with this man.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.760]   Wow, you know, here's somebody who can scale a business.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.320]   Here's somebody who can be prudent and build wealth.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.320]   If there was a YouTube video or something,
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.680]   we're like, wow, you know, this guy's like,
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.480]   he made it from like not having as much
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.800]   and he built his business empire.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.320]   You know, that's impressive.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.320]   Now, because this is in the context of Jesus teaching,
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.960]   we know what comes before, we know there's some issue.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.120]   But what is it?
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.800]   You know, what is the issue that Jesus is addressing here?
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.440]   Well, if you pay close attention to the inner dialogue,
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.440]   we start getting a hint at what the problem is.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.120]   And it actually reveals to us, you know,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.360]   some of the values and some of the motivations
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.840]   that this man's holding in his heart.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.240]   So if you notice, there's all these I and my statements.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.680]   You know, it's all about him.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.080]   It's all about what he has done.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.720]   It's all his.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.240]   It's like my crops, my abundance, my surplus, myself.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.360]   Actually, the word translated here is myself is my soul.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.120]   You know, it's all my, my, my, I, I, I.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.600]   There is no thought of anyone else
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.600]   and there is no thought of God.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.400]   You know, there's an absence of acknowledgement of God.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.520]   So this goes in contrast, you know,
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.240]   to what Psalm 24 once says,
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.280]   says the earth is the Lord's and everything in it,
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.680]   the world and all who live in it.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.880]   Which means that actually, you know,
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.440]   God has created everything.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.360]   And all that we have, including our life,
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.640]   our breath, our health, whatever possessions we have,
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.720]   everything is a gift from God.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.360]   Every single thing.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.480]   Now we a lot of times think we did it ourselves.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.520]   You know, but everything we have is a gift from God.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.240]   And this man, you know, there is no God in his equation.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.680]   I mean, he thinks it's all him.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.360]   So this is where the twist comes into the parable.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.480]   Verse 20, but God said to him,
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.480]   you fool, this very night,
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.040]   your life will be demanded from you.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.040]   Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.040]   This is how it will be with whoever stores up things
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.040]   for themselves, but is not rich towards God.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.400]   So while most of us, you know,
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.600]   when we look at this story, what made me think, wow,
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.760]   a prudent, successful businessman
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.080]   who knows how to scale a business and accumulate wealth
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:50.080]   and do something good, God calls him a fool.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.000]   You fool.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.880]   It's quite a different verdict than we would expect, right?
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.360]   It's also quite strong language, right?
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.640]   To be called a fool.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:05.040]   So why does God call this man a fool?
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.880]   Well, God calls this man a fool
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.760]   because all of his investments,
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.640]   all of his wealth is directed towards himself.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.280]   It's all for himself.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.000]   There's no thought of neighbor.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.080]   You know, it's all about himself.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.160]   And he just cares about himself.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.120]   He just invests the money on himself.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.880]   He doesn't think of anyone else.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.560]   There's no acknowledgement of God.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:40.240]   There is, he actually sees his money as a security.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:46.160]   You know that, you can see that in his plans, right?
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.120]   He has a plans that like, I will live the abundant life.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.320]   I'm going to eat, drink, be merry, enjoy my wealth.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.960]   So he actually placed his faith in his possessions,
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.560]   but he lacks faith in God.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.640]   And he thinks that his possessions
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.560]   will give him the security of his anxious heart,
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   that the possessions will make sure
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.640]   that he's going to be okay.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.800]   But when it comes to the end of his life,
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.200]   they actually don't deliver.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.320]   And the lie is exposed.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   That so many of us, that we actually kind of believe, right?
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.000]   If we're honest.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.520]   And then in verse 20, we find out that God tells him,
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.400]   you know, this very night, your life will be demanded of you.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.360]   And it's actually interesting
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.560]   'cause the literal Greek says your soul,
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.160]   you know, before he says my soul.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.240]   And then now he says that even our life,
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.040]   you know, something that we steward.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.520]   And it will be demanded of you.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.640]   And then he asked a question,
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.440]   and who will get what you have prepared for yourself?
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.640]   Who's going to have your stuff?
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:08.280]   And at this time, it just shows the emptiness,
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.840]   the spiritual bankruptcy with which he stands before God.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.640]   You know, because that's not his question anymore.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   He has different concerns on it this time.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.200]   He has different questions on it at this point.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.840]   And then Jesus concludes by saying,
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.240]   you know, gives like a wisdom saying,
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.840]   he says this is how it will be
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.640]   with whoever stores up things for themselves,
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.040]   but is not rich towards God.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.240]   And so there's a contrast.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.760]   There's like storing up things towards yourself
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.040]   versus being rich towards God.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.840]   And he's saying, you know, that's a consequence
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.480]   when we're just all about ourselves.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.160]   When we try to find a security in possessions and wealth,
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.000]   when we try to find power, significance, influence,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.960]   you know, whatever it is.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.880]   For people, money means different things for people,
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.120]   possessions mean different things for people.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.840]   And whatever it is that we're trying to find in it,
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.200]   it does not deliver if it's just direct towards ourself.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.120]   So Jesus then concludes that, you know,
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.080]   this man made a disastrous investment.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.640]   And actually kind of ends open-ended
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.800]   because we don't know what he does.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.640]   We don't know what he says.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.760]   Now, suddenly we don't hear his inner dialogue anymore.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.200]   And actually it's meant for ourselves to think about,
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.120]   you know, what's inside of our, what's our inner dialogue?
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.680]   You know, what are we saying to ourselves?
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.520]   And so while the man in the parable
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.840]   didn't acknowledge God at all,
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.640]   many of us here, we actually do.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.160]   Not all of us, but many of us here do.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.560]   But nonetheless, we're not immune
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.960]   to the chasing after riches
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.160]   and trying to secure a future
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.520]   through the accumulation of wealth.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.640]   We also believe that false narrative,
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.800]   even as Christians, right?
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.760]   That possessions, they're gonna solve our problems.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.880]   They're gonna give us security
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.280]   so we can finally rest, not be anxious.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.800]   Possessions are gonna give us significance.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.680]   People are gonna listen to me.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.400]   I'm gonna have influence.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.760]   Possessions are gonna give us power
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.440]   so we can have an impact, you know, whatever it is.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.040]   And we believe that.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.040]   And they do to a certain degree.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.800]   But in the end, they never fully deliver.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.600]   And contrary to what Jesus says,
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.680]   that life does not consist in abundance of possession,
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.720]   we think it does.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.680]   You know, we actually believe that it does.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.280]   If you picture an abundant life, what do you picture?
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.160]   Exactly, right?
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.680]   And I have to be honest, I picture the same thing.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.640]   But what Jesus is trying to bring a corrective,
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.720]   you know, to us.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.200]   So money and possessions, they're idols.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   You know, they're idols of our heart.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.240]   And Tim Keller, who was a well-known pastor in the US,
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.080]   he defines an idol this way.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.120]   An idol is anything more important to you than God.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.200]   Anything that absorbs your heart
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.840]   and imagination more than God.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:01.000]   Anything you seek to give you what only God can give.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.160]   And so in the parable, we see that this rich man,
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.840]   he is daydreaming.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.600]   You know, his imagination is stirred by his possessions
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.440]   and by his wealth.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.040]   And he dreams of how this will give him security,
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.840]   how this will give him a relaxing retirement.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:24.720]   And, but it reveals, you know, that that's his idol.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.360]   That's what he puts his faith really in.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.280]   And I think with us, we've been talking about,
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.440]   there's a lot of theoretical in our Christian faith.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.920]   We theoretically, you know, believe that
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.000]   abundant life is in God.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.600]   But if we actually look at our life practice,
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.080]   we see a lot of times that we actually place our faith
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.000]   in other things.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.720]   We actually place our faith in, you know, in our jobs
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.600]   or in our bank account or whatever it is,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.840]   or your house that you own
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.080]   or working towards owning or whatever.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.520]   And the man that came to Jesus, you know,
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.840]   with a request about his inheritance,
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.920]   he also thought that the inheritance
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.040]   is gonna deliver for him something, you know,
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.160]   whether it's that security again.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.400]   And we all heard, or maybe even experienced personally
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.520]   yourself, like just horror stories of inheritance,
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.320]   you know, where there's horrible fighting,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.440]   where relationships fall apart,
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.360]   where it's just brokenness and just destroys
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.720]   and devastates families.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.560]   And again, it just shows that we hold this idol in our heart,
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.120]   you know, that we think this inheritance
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.440]   is gonna do something and we don't care about the relationship.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.640]   We just wanna get ours, what we think is ours,
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.920]   and it doesn't matter if the relationship is destroyed.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.480]   You know, and it's devastating.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.760]   Now, what's interesting, when we think about greed,
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.920]   a lot of times we don't think of ourselves.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.160]   Like I've heard several pastors say,
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.240]   "Nobody ever comes to me and confesses that they're greedy."
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.360]   You know, people share all sorts of things,
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:58.080]   you know, sexual brokenness, affairs,
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.120]   you know, broken relationships,
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.320]   whatever, you know, like having cheated someone,
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.680]   whatever it may be.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.480]   But what this shows is that most of us
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.400]   actually don't think of ourselves as greedy.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.600]   We don't think it's our issue,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.920]   we think it's the other person's issue.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.600]   And we can always find someone that we can point to, right?
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.280]   Can always find someone else where you can say,
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.840]   "Oh yeah, it's their issue, but it's not my issue."
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.640]   But here, Jesus, he's exposing these inner dialogues
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.600]   and things in our hearts.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.560]   He's actually saying, "But actually it's all of our issue."
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:39.520]   You know, and Jesus is calling us
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.960]   to bring this issue to him
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.920]   so that we can overcome this issue
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.600]   by the power of Jesus in our lives,
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.160]   and that we can live lives that are rich towards God,
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.920]   not just rich towards ourselves.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.880]   Now, I had a financial transaction
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.160]   that I was trying to,
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.880]   or like a business thing that I was trying to do,
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.080]   and it fell through in the last moment.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.160]   And I was so angry.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.520]   I'm a very relaxed person.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.720]   I know a lot of you don't know me that well.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   I'm a very relaxed person.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.680]   I don't get very angry most of the time.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.960]   But I was super angry.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.360]   And then as I suddenly realized my strong emotions,
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.520]   I was like, "Whoa, what's going on here?
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.000]   Why am I so upset?"
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.920]   And the truth is, you know,
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.280]   because I placed hope in this investment
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.720]   that it would do something for me
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.560]   that actually only God can do.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:46.680]   You know, I thought this thing will bring me security.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.920]   I thought this thing will bring me significance,
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.120]   but it doesn't.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.440]   You know, that is only found in God,
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.440]   your significance, your security.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.520]   And so when our faith is in other things besides God,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.000]   it's hard to live a life that's rich towards God
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.280]   'cause we're trying to hold on to our possessions.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.960]   You know, we can't be generous to other people
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.840]   because we think these possessions are significant.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.160]   So we grab onto them and we can't hold them loosely.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.320]   And also keeps us from doing a lot of times
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.520]   the things that Jesus asked us to do,
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.280]   which maybe there's a brother or sister
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.400]   he wants us to be generous to.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.120]   But if we think this thing will secure us,
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.120]   we can't let it go.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.080]   We can't be generous to that person.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:35.000]   And Jesus, he wants to break the power
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.840]   of this grip of greed in our lives.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.440]   He wants us to be free.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.040]   Earlier, you were saying about freedom.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.240]   So we can be free to love other people.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.760]   We can be free to reflect a character of God,
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.520]   of generosity towards others.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.120]   That it doesn't just have to be about ourselves
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.800]   and we don't have to direct all this wealth
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.960]   or whatever it is towards us.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.360]   And by the way, this can be anyone.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.320]   You can be rich or poor,
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.240]   and we still struggle with the same heart issue.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.080]   You know, it's not about who has a lot
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.600]   or who doesn't have much.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.640]   We all struggle with greed.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.440]   It's a heart issue for all of us.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:19.400]   And then Jesus, actually, we're not gonna read further,
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.960]   I'm gonna tell you what happens afterwards.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.240]   He talks about not being anxious
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.320]   'cause our loving Father cares for us
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.160]   and to seek first his kingdom.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.920]   And then all these things will be added unto you.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:38.240]   And isn't that amazing that actually God promises us
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.000]   that when we are generous,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.680]   when we live a life that's of love and serving our labors
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.560]   and making investments in the kingdom,
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.080]   that he will provide for us.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.760]   He actually will give us what we need.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.920]   It doesn't mean that he's gonna not give us a yacht
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.480]   or something like that,
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.440]   but he will provide for us what we need.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.880]   He will take care of us.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:05.360]   So seeking the kingdom,
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.640]   if we make that a priority in our lives,
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.720]   it means that we're willing to do God's will.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.640]   And it means that we're following Jesus
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.800]   in all aspects of our lives.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   But if we're holding idols,
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.640]   how do they keep us from doing that?
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.040]   And so Jesus wants to free us
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.520]   so we can actually fully follow him,
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.160]   that we can fully live for him.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.640]   And I just picture as a church,
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.880]   wouldn't it be amazing
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:35.280]   if we all just grow in seeking the kingdom
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.200]   and in obedience to Jesus and living generous lives
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.560]   and growing in generosity?
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.200]   I think it's a process a lot of times.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.520]   It's not like most times,
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.680]   it's not just from one moment to the next
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.880]   that you completely change.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.760]   What impact we as a community could have
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.880]   for God's kingdom would be amazing.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.160]   I wanna see that.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.000]   But in order to do that,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.320]   we need faith and we struggle to trust God
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.400]   that he will care for us and that he will provide for us.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.760]   So my sense for today is that Jesus wants to give us faith.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.920]   That he actually wants to today release faith on us.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.680]   He wants to give us trust
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.720]   so that we can courage us and live for him,
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.480]   that we don't have to live in fear.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.240]   'Cause it's like we live by fear
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.480]   when we're holding on to possessions,
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.440]   we're living in fear.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.600]   'Cause we think these things will deliver,
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.240]   but he's calling us to faith in him.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.000]   That he loves you, he loves us,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   he loves our heavenly father, loves his children.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.640]   He will provide for us.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.520]   As I was thinking about it,
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.680]   I was reminded of being in the US as a child.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.200]   I couldn't swim.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.480]   When I was a little kid,
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.600]   we were at some friends that lived in a apartment complex.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.200]   They had a swimming pool
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.800]   like you know that people who live there can use.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.000]   And so I remember like running and jumping
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.360]   in a swimming pool even though I couldn't swim.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.960]   It's not a good idea, right?
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.040]   But the reason why I could do it
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   was because my father was there.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.640]   'Cause he caught me.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.400]   Because I knew I could trust him,
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.280]   I could rely on him,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.440]   I could take the step of faith,
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.320]   you know, and jump there
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.680]   because he would take care of me,
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.560]   would help me get back to the edge of the pool.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.240]   I even went on the diving board,
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.640]   you know, and jumped in.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.880]   But it was just because I knew my father had my back.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.720]   And in a similar way,
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.960]   when we know just the father's love,
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.960]   when we know the saving love and care of Jesus in our lives,
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:37.320]   it frees us to be generous and loving towards others.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.360]   You know, we can have that same type of faith
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.160]   where we can just dive in
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.760]   because we know he loves us,
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.000]   he will take care of us,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.320]   we can be bold.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.760]   But if we don't know his love,
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.600]   if we don't believe it,
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.280]   if we struggle to trust his heart.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.720]   So I also believe that today God wants
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.720]   to reveal his love to us.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.000]   You know, that the reality of his love
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.040]   can break over our lives.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.720]   That we can start living differently,
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.640]   that we can start living generously,
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.280]   beautifully, abundantly,
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.520]   and be rich towards God
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.800]   and seek his kingdom first
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.520]   and make incredible investments in his kingdom
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:30.440]   and see God do things that have eternal,
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.400]   you know, consequences,
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.640]   that make an eternal difference.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.200]   So how can I be rich towards God
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   and invest,
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.360]   how can we be rich towards God
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.280]   and invest ourselves in what truly matters?
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.400]   I wanna invite the worship team to come up.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.800]   How can we take the step of actually living
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.040]   in this radical generosity
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.320]   that Jesus calls us to,
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.360]   where we're not just about
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.200]   accumulating things for ourselves,
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.960]   but we're not living in fear,
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.880]   but where we can live in faith.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.200]   How do we actually do that?
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.080]   Well, the first thing is,
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.680]   it's not about trying harder.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.000]   You know, it's not about,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.920]   I'm gonna try harder to be more generous
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.000]   and give a little and give a little of my time,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   give a little of my energy,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.920]   give a little bit of my money.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.240]   No, it's actually acknowledging,
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.040]   it's surrendering to Jesus.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.400]   It's like, I can't do this.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   And I need you.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.080]   And it's also asking Jesus,
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.280]   I've been holding this idol in my heart
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.720]   that I think delivers what only you can give.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.120]   Will you forgive me for this?
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.120]   And will instead, will you show me your love for me?
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.120]   Will you show me that you care for me,
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.800]   that you provide for me,
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.760]   that you will give me what I need?
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:54.400]   And then as that reality breaks over our lives,
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.320]   as the spirit of God makes that known to us,
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.760]   we can ask him, Lord,
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.480]   how do you want me to be generous this week?
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.400]   What do you want me to do?
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.480]   How can I show love towards people around me?
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.040]   Maybe how can I show love towards people
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.440]   here in this church community?
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.360]   How can I show love towards people in my family
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.880]   and outside, the wider Yuen Long community?
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.840]   And then when God reveals to you what to do,
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.200]   take the step of faith,
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.880]   you jump into the pool and you do it.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.880]   And you trust that he will work through it,
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.920]   but you also trust that you're not gonna suffer loss
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.840]   because of it,
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.640]   but that you are gonna live a life
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.760]   that's rich towards God.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.080]   So I wanna invite everyone to stand.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.840]   I would love to pray over us.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:56.080]   If, I wanna invite you to really think about right now,
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.040]   am I seeking his kingdom first
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.240]   or is there other things I'm seeking after?
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.720]   Am I seeking his kingdom first
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.960]   or are there other things I'm seeking after?
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:17.720]   And if you just say, Jesus, I wanna seek your kingdom,
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.760]   but I'm struggling to trust you that you are truly good,
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.600]   that you will truly deliver, that you will truly provide,
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.320]   I just wanna invite you to stretch out your hand
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.120]   as an expression of just openness to God
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.760]   and just a desire and a surrender to him.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.480]   Like I wanna seek you, I wanna live for you.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.960]   I don't want these idols to rule in my heart.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.440]   I want you, Jesus, to rule my heart.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.720]   And let me pray over you.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.920]   Jesus, I thank you so much
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.480]   that you love us so incredibly much.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.840]   Lord, you know all of our journeys.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.440]   You know every single heart in this room.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.400]   You know the things that we hold dear,
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.280]   that we think will provide for us, deliver things for us,
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.440]   give us security.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:08.240]   But I just pray that everything is a lie
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.840]   that you expose that right now.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.320]   That you help us instead to turn our hearts to you
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.880]   and place our faith and our trust in you.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:23.920]   I ask Holy Spirit that you will come right now
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.000]   and reveal your love to us,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.880]   the love of the Father who doesn't abandon his children,
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.160]   who doesn't give bad gifts, he gives good gifts.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.120]   It's the Father that will add these things unto you
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.040]   when you live that radical life of generosity
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.280]   and radical life of faith, of following him,
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.120]   of doing the things Jesus calls us to do.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.760]   Or will you pour out this faith
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.400]   and this courage in our hearts?
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:57.520]   Will you forgive us for greed where we failed you?
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.480]   But will you help us by your Spirit to live differently?
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.120]   Will you strengthen us by your grace?
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   Will you help us to be people of faith, not people of fear?
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.200]   And we know that it's your Spirit's work.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.320]   It's not we can't do this out of our own strength, Lord.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.760]   So will you come right now,
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.760]   will you help us to be seekers of your kingdom
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.360]   as a community?
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.320]   I pray all this in your name, Jesus.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.160]   Amen.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.960]   Let's worship.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.540]   (upbeat music)
