1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 At the beginning of all things, there was simply darkness, nothingness, a void over all of the world.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 And in this darkness, there was a sense of expectation.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 The Bible describes it as the Spirit of God hovering over the darkness, waiting to bring it to life.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 And then, four words were spoken.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 "Let there be light."

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 And with those four simple words, a command, and suddenly, the darkness was broken.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And a light came into the world.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 And lightness covered the darkness, and life started.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And with that creative moment of light, God made a declaration.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 He said that there is purpose and intent to creation.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 That there is a reason why He has made the world.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 The light represented the thought in God's heart that with light comes life, and with life, intent and purpose and goodness.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And suddenly, the darkness was no more.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 A command of God, and everything changed.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But then we have a problem.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Because just after those moments, humanity then gets involved.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And humanity, as it often does, changes things.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And humanity taking from that tree of the knowledge of the good and evil,

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 a place that they were not expected to eat,

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 where they were commanded to leave alone, they grabbed.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And suddenly, they were brought back into darkness again.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 A darkness perhaps not literally over the earth, but a darkness upon the person.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 A darkness and a stilling, if you will, of the soul.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 A darkness in relationship between us and God, us and ourselves, us and one another, and yes, us and creation.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Literally, Adam and Eve, after they had taken the fruit, they recoil from the light of the presence of God.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And the first act of them in the garden as God returns to them after they had taken the fruit, was to retreat into the darkness of creation.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And humanity, if we're honest with ourselves, has been retreating into the darkness of creation ever since.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 In fact, the Bible, for the rest of the Old Testament, uses the metaphor of darkness and light.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 This idea that while we are now captivated as humans in a place of spiritual and relational darkness,

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 there is the ability for God to continue to bring His light.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Throughout our Old Testament scriptures, darkness and light is played together in poetic metaphor.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 The darkness of hatred, but the light of love.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 The darkness of injustice, but the light of God's grace.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 The darkness of our sin, and yet the light of a God who forgives and redeems and restores.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And the Old Testament prophets begin to pick up this idea of light and darkness,

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 to begin to speak prophetically of a hope that is to come.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 The prophets understood that there was no way in human skills and strategies to get out of the darkness back into light.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 The only way the darkness could be pierced, the darkness could be broken, is if God brought His light to the world again.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So the prophets began to speak of a day, of a time in the future, not too distant,

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 where God would break into the darkness once again with His eternal light.

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 That the light that comes in this time would never be extinguished.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 This light would be for the life of all humans forever, an eternal salvation of His people.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 So the prophets spoke of this light all the time.

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Let me give you one beautiful example from Isaiah chapter 9.

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Isaiah says this,

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 "The people walking in darkness have seen a great light.

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 On those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 For to us a child is born.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 To us a son is given and the government will be on his shoulders.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And so in the present place of darkness there was a prophetic voice of hope.

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 That one day somebody would come, described by Isaiah like a child,

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 to those who are walking in darkness.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And when that one comes, darkness will be no more.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 700 years later, after Isaiah's prophetic word, a new day indeed dawned.

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Jesus, born to an impoverished family in a small town on the outskirts of Jerusalem,

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 in a dirty stable, Christ's light appeared.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And light is the wonderful theme of the whole of the Christmas story.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 As we've travelled through Advent together as a church, we've seen this theme time and time again.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 The light of the angel appearing to Mary to tell her that she will be pregnant.

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 The light of the angels appearing to the shepherds, overwhelmed as they were,

62
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 declaring the glory of God and the birth of the Son, Jesus.

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And a light, of course, in the sky for those Magi's in the east,

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 following that star right to the place where Jesus was born.

65
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Light dominates the Christmas story.

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And essentially it's because what we see is the greatest light is not in the sky,

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 it's not some angel, it's a fragile human child.

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 The person of Jesus, wrapped up in cloth, laid in a dirty stable,

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 is the greatest light that this world has ever known.

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 In Jesus we have this profound message of Christmas.

71
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 That God was willing to come to a dark place with the light of his salvation,

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 so we may know true life.

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 That's the wonder of Christmas.

74
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 That's what we've been singing and celebrating over this month,

75
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 what you've been doing on Friday night, and hopefully what you celebrated yesterday

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 with your friends and family, that a light has come so we would know true life,

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 salvation, redemption and glory, forgiveness of sin, redemption for one another.

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 That's the beauty of Christmas.

79
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 But here's the thing, when we think about Jesus as the light of this world,

80
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 it is not just a declaration that he's like some light that we're drawn to,

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 that he's some light of eternal salvation that makes our lives better.

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 As wonderful as that is, that's not the full picture of saying

83
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 that Jesus is actually the light of the world.

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 What we are actually seeing at Christmas is more than that.

85
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Jesus is not just a light that draws people towards salvation,

86
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Jesus is the light that illuminates everything else.

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 That Jesus is a light, if you will, is not just one that shines towards salvation,

88
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 it's a one that shines out into the world,

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 so that the darkness would be revealed for what it truly is.

90
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 When we say that Jesus is the light of the world, what we're actually saying is this,

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 that in Jesus we have not just the light that gives us the source of all life,

92
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 but the source by which all life can be seen.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Are you with me?

94
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Maybe you're not.

95
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 So let me explain this scientifically for you.

96
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Light, literally, is electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths that are visible to the human eye.

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Is that helping with you now?

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Electromagnetic radiation wavelengths visible to the human eye.

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 They're actually 400 to 700 nanometers in length, in diameter.

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 In other words, they're some of the smallest things in the world that are actually visible to us.

101
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 These electromagnetic wavelengths travel at the fastest speed that anything in the world travels.

102
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 They travel at 186,182 miles per second.

103
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Not just miles per hour, miles per second.

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Nothing in the world travels faster than that.

105
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And what happens is, your ability to actually see, your ability to be able to perceive anything,

106
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 is because these electromagnetic wavelengths are zipping all around the world at all times.

107
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 They're bouncing off objects, and as they bounce off objects, they go into your eyes,

108
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 your brain processes it, and you see something.

109
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 So here's Ivan.

110
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And even in the darkest of days, Ivan is a wonder to look at.

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 He's a good looking guy, right?

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Electromagnetic wavelengths are flying at Ivan all the time, they're bouncing off of him,

113
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 they come into my eyes, I process it, and I see the glory that is Ivan, right?

114
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 That is the wonder of sight.

115
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Now, here's the thing.

116
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Darkness, therefore, is the absence of light.

117
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 You all know that, don't you?

118
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But think of it scientifically.

119
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Darkness is the absence of electromagnetic wavelengths bouncing off things,

120
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 going into your eyes and processing something to enable you to see.

121
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And if you're anything like me, and you grew up in Hong Kong,

122
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 trust me, you do not know darkness.

123
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Are you with me, Hong Kong people?

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 We don't have darkness in Hong Kong.

125
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 In Hong Kong, you have daytime, and then slightly less dark, or slightly less bright nighttime,

126
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 is basically what we have.

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Because we have light pollution everywhere in Hong Kong, don't we?

128
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 So you know what it's like when you get to the end of your day,

129
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 and you turn off your light in your bedroom,

130
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 kind of is a little bit dark, but you can still see stuff in your bedroom and stuff.

131
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 That's not really dark, my friends.

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Trust me, if you want to know dark, move to New Zealand.

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 [laughter]

134
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 My wife is from New Zealand, okay?

135
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And I did not understand darkness until she took me to New Zealand.

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 She took me to her family's home.

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 It's a place called Hamilton.

138
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 It's classified a city in New Zealand, but it's basically like a small village in England.

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 But it is this place.

140
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And we go there, and she takes us to her childhood home.

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And we had a wonderful day.

142
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 This is my first time in New Zealand.

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 We had a wonderful day with her family.

144
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 We get into her bedroom at night.

145
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 We get into the bed.

146
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 We were married, just want to make it clear.

147
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 We get into the bed, and we have our lights on by the side of the bed, as we often do.

148
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 We did a bit of reading.

149
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 She turned off her light.

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 I turned off my light, and I was like, "Ahhhh!"

151
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Because for the first time in my life,

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 it was pitch black.

153
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 It was the same blackness, whether my eyes were open or closed.

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Like, it was completely black.

155
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 There was no light anywhere.

156
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 There was the absence of electromagnetic wavelengths.

157
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 They were not flying anywhere in New Zealand in that time, okay?

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 It is super dark.

159
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Who's experienced darkness like that, right?

160
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Yeah, it's crazy when it's that dark.

161
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I was like, lying in bed.

162
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 After I'd gotten over the panic, I was lying in bed, experimenting,

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 and I had my hand in front of my face.

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And I couldn't see it until it touched my nose.

165
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And it would freak me out.

166
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 "Where's my hand? Ah!"

167
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 When Jesus, in John 8, 12, says this,

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 "I am the light of the world.

169
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Whoever would follow after me would never walk in darkness,

170
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 but would see the light of life."

171
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 He's actually saying two things.

172
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 He's saying, "Yes, I am the light of this salvation.

173
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 I am the light of your hope.

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 If you come to me and bring me your sin,

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 I will redeem you and set you free."

176
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 But he's also saying, "If you come and follow me,

177
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 if you have relationship with me,

178
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 you will never walk in darkness."

179
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Why? "Because through me, I illuminate everything in this world."

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 In other words, if you want to see the world as it truly is,

181
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 as it should be, as I want you to see it,

182
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 you cannot see the world clearly

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 unless you're in relationship with me, is what he's saying.

184
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 That there is darkness around there,

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 but if you follow me,

186
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I will bring that darkness to life,

187
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 and you will see as you should truly see.

188
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 You see, without light, it is impossible to see.

189
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Without Jesus, you will never see clearly or well.

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Are you with me, people?

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Jesus is not just this salvation to get our sins forgiven

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 so we get into heaven at some point.

193
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Jesus is also the revelation

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 that through relationship with him,

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 we can begin to see things as they truly are.

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Jesus is not just the gift of life,

197
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Jesus is the illumination of life.

198
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 He enables us to see the world and life

199
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 as it truly should be seen.

200
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 The wonder of Christmas

201
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 is that we have a light that has come into this world

202
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 so that we get salvation,

203
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 but also we get to look at one another

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 and truly see each other through the light of Jesus.

205
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Trust me, when I see you through the light of Andrew,

206
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 you look pretty dark.

207
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Just being honest with you.

208
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 When I look into a mirror

209
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 through the eyes of darkness in Andrew,

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 it looks pretty grim.

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 But when I look at you through the light of Jesus,

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 I've never seen more better looking people

213
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 than I've ever seen in my life.

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 When I look into that mirror through the light of Jesus,

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I do my best to see this beautiful boy,

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 this wonderful guy,

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 forgiven and redeemed.

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Are you with me?

219
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 So when we say that Jesus is light,

220
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 what is it exactly that he's illuminating for us?

221
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 What is it this Christmas time

222
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 that I think Jesus wants you to see really clearly?

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Well, that's the question

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 that our Christmas story answers.

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And we've been spending our time in Luke during Advent,

226
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 but I want today, this morning on Boxing Day,

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 to go to Matthew.

228
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And I want to read you Matthew's story

229
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 that happens immediately after the birth of Jesus.

230
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 In other words, for Matthew,

231
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 he gives us this story to tell us

232
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 this is what Jesus illuminates.

233
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Jesus is born, comes into the world,

234
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 and his light illuminates things.

235
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And in this story, Matthew shows us

236
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 three ways that Jesus illuminates life for us.

237
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I want to read this to you.

238
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Matthew 2, verse 1.

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea,

240
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 during the time of King Herod,

241
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 the people of the East came to Jerusalem

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 and asked this question,

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 "Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews?

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 For we saw his star, a light, get this,

245
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 in the sky on the East,

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 and we have come now to worship him.

247
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 When King Herod heard this,

248
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 he was disturbed, and oh, Jerusalem with him."

249
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 I love this.

250
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Basically, this is saying when King Herod is angry,

251
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 the rest of the city trembles in fear

252
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 and anticipation for what he's going to do.

253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Verse 4, "When he called together

254
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law,

255
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 he asked them, 'Where is this Christ to be born?'

256
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 'Oh, in Bethlehem of Judea,' they replied,

257
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 'for this is what the prophets have written,'"

258
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 and they quote from Micah,

259
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 "'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah,

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 for out of you will come a ruler

262
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 who will be the shepherd of our people, Israel.'

263
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Then Herod called the Magi secretly

264
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 and found out from them the exact time

265
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 when the light had appeared.

266
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 He sent them to Bethlehem and said this,

267
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 'Go and make careful search for this child,

268
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 for as soon as you find him,

269
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 report to me so that I too may go and worship him.'

270
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 After they had heard the king,

271
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 they went on their way,

272
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 and the star led them all the way from the east,

273
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 all the way to the place where it stopped over,

274
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 the place where the child was.

275
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 When they saw the star,

276
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 they were overwhelmed with joy.

277
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 On coming to the house,

278
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 they saw the child with his mother Mary,

279
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 and they worshipped him.

280
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 When they opened their treasures

281
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 and presented with him gifts of gold and incense and myrrh,

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 and having been warned by a dream

283
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 not to go back to Herod,

284
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 they returned to their country by another route.

285
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 When they had gone,

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 an angel, a being of light, if you will,

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 appeared to Joseph in a dream.

288
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 'Get up,' he said.

289
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 'Take the child and his mother,

290
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 and escape to Egypt.

291
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Stay there until I tell you,

292
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.'

293
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 So he got up, took the child with his mother,

294
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 and during the night they left and fled for Egypt,

295
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 where they stayed until the death of Herod.

296
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And so it was fulfilled

297
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 what the Lord had said through his prophet,

298
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 'Out of Egypt I called my son.'

299
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi,

300
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 he was furious,

301
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem

302
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 and in its vicinity,

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 who were two years and under,

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 in accordance with the time that he had learned from the Magi.

305
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled.

306
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 A voice is heard in Ramah,

307
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 weeping in great mourning,

308
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Rachel weeping for her children

309
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 and refusing to be comforted

310
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 because they are no more."

311
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 It blows my mind

312
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 that Matthew follows the story of the birth of Jesus

313
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 with a story of what happens

314
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 immediately after the light comes into the world.

315
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Here's what happens.

316
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Darkness tries to overcome it straight away.

317
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Immediately there's this story of pretty big darkness.

318
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 I mean Christmas is a time to celebrate Christmas.

319
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 It's a time to find joy.

320
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And yet immediately the darkness tries to fight back.

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And Matthew here is trying to show us

322
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 the beauty and the wonder

323
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 of what the light of Christ truly shines on.

324
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 First of all, it's a light that shines on ourselves.

325
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 What Matthew does is he sets up a tension

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 and a contrast between Herod and Joseph.

327
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 In this passage.

328
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 He shows us Herod

329
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 and he shows Herod as the worst kind of human being

330
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 that there possibly can.

331
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 I mean here's a man who abuses his power.

332
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Here's a man who has got darkness in his heart.

333
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Here's a man who struggles with jealousy, rage and anger.

334
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 A man who any threats to his throne must be squashed.

335
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 A man who decides out of a place of anger and insecurity

336
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 to basically order a genocide.

337
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 To basically murder hundreds of Jewish children

338
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 in Bethlehem and in the villages surrounding it.

339
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 The backdrop to the Christmas story

340
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 is the wailing and the suffering of families

341
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 whose children have been stolen from them and killed.

342
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Herod represents for us in this story

343
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 the worst of what happens to humanity

344
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 when darkness overtakes our hearts.

345
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 This is Adam and Eve

346
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Genesis 3

347
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 taken to its worst form.

348
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 This is Matthew saying

349
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 this is what some of us can become like.

350
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And then he contrasts that

351
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 before we would get ourselves into much of a place of despondency

352
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 with Joseph.

353
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And Matthew is basically saying

354
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 yes there are Herods in this world

355
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 but there are also Josephs.

356
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And he shows us

357
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 what a relationship can be like with God

358
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 where despite the darkness in our hearts as humans

359
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 there is great faithfulness to be found.

360
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Joseph is shown by Matthew here

361
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 as a kind, humble, faithful man.

362
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 A man who's not perfect

363
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 but a man who hears the voice of God

364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 and the word of God and decides to respond.

365
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And in being obedient to God's word

366
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 unlike Adam in the garden who was disobedient

367
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 in being obedient to God's word

368
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 takes his Mary and Jesus

369
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 flees to Egypt and they survive

370
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 and the light is not as distinguished.

371
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 And so there's this idea of the darkness of Herod in humanity

372
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 and yet the wonder that can be in humanity

373
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 with the faithfulness of Joseph.

374
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And Matthew's asking us all a strong question.

375
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Which one do you want to be?

376
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Because while there's probably no mass murderers sitting in this room

377
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 at least I hope not

378
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 there is a little bit of Herod in all of us, isn't there?

379
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 There's a little bit of jealousy

380
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 of anger

381
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 a little bit of brokenness

382
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 a little bit of insecurity

383
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 a little bit of a desire for power sometimes.

384
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 There are Herods if you will

385
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 that can sit in all of us.

386
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And yet Matthew would say this

387
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 the light of Christ in Christmas time

388
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 illuminates ourselves

389
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 so that yes we become aware of the Herods

390
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 but in being aware of the Herods

391
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 we can bring them to the only place

392
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 where God can deal with them.

393
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 A savior. One who's come.

394
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 God with us.

395
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 One who has revealed the beauty and the glory of God

396
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 and so Joseph reminds us

397
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 that as we shine the light on ourselves

398
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 we bring our Herods.

399
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 We don't bury them.

400
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And as you go from 2021 to 2022

401
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 may Christmas encourage you

402
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 that the light of Christ shines a light on yourself

403
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 so that you can leave your Herods behind

404
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 and walk like Joseph into the new year.

405
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Not perfect

406
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 struggling at times

407
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 but humble before God

408
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 faithful and obedient to His word.

409
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Let me tell you this

410
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 we're stepping into a new year

411
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 where there's still a lot of darkness in our city.

412
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Where there's still a lot of challenge around us.

413
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 And are we going to allow the Herods to win in us?

414
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Or are we going to bring our Herods

415
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 receive God's love

416
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 and then shine the light of Christ to the world

417
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 not the dirtiness of the Herods

418
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 that are buried in us.

419
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Are you with me church?

420
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Because light shines a light on ourselves.

421
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 But it also shines a light on the world.

422
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 One of the great things that we see in this passage

423
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 as Matthew unpacks this story

424
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 is the reality of what the world is truly like.

425
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And I love this.

426
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I love the fact that in the Christmas story

427
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 God is not trying to bury the reality

428
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 that there is still much brokenness in this world.

429
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 I love the way that Matthew

430
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 connects it to the Old Testament passage in verse 18.

431
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 He says, "A voice is heard in Ramah

432
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 weeping and great mourning."

433
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Rachel weeping for her children

434
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 and refusing to be comforted

435
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 because they are no more.

436
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 He doesn't hide from the darkness of the genocide.

437
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And he says, "Here's the reality.

438
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 You want to know what's happening in Bethlehem right now

439
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 right after the birth of Jesus?

440
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 It's not celebration. It's not joy.

441
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 There's weeping taking place.

442
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 There's hardship.

443
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Things are still difficult in this world.

444
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 And the glory of the light of Christ

445
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 is that through Jesus

446
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 things are illuminated

447
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 so we can see them as they truly are.

448
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Not so we can see them and be repulsed by them

449
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 but see them and be drawn to them

450
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 with the hope that is in us in Jesus Christ.

451
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 That we can look out into the world around us

452
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 and realize that so often

453
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 life is a contrast of rejoicing and weeping.

454
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Of worship and the suffering that we see around us.

455
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And as Christians we have been given the light of Christ

456
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 so that we might be vehicles of hope

457
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 to those that are suffering.

458
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And the Christmas story reminds us

459
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 that the light that is in us is not just for us.

460
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 That the light in that stable

461
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 was for the whole world.

462
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And it's a light that shines outwards

463
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 from the church,

464
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 God's people on earth.

465
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And each one of you represents an incredible sphere of influence.

466
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Where you've got darkness around you.

467
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Friends, people, situations,

468
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 hardship, stuff that's happening

469
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 that you know about in your sphere of influence.

470
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And I tell you what, if you're anything like me

471
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 a lot of the conversations you're having with people these days

472
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 they're dark, sad, down kind of conversations.

473
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I've had so many conversations recently with people at dinner

474
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 or over coffee and people bemoaning Hong Kong

475
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 and all the bad stuff that's happening

476
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 and of course we are not to ignore the realities of our situation.

477
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 But the light of Christ has come

478
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 so that these things could be illuminated

479
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 so that we wouldn't join in with the chorus of

480
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 "Oh yeah, isn't everything terrible?"

481
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 But we would join with a new chorus,

482
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 a new song on our hearts

483
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 that we would shine with the hope of Jesus

484
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 not ignoring the realities of the world

485
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 but saying darkness does not win.

486
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 That there is something that has come into this world

487
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 that now shines a light that is much needed.

488
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 So at Christmas time we have to be really careful

489
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 that we don't allow the rejoicing of our worship

490
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 as important as that is

491
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 to drown out the sobs of the people

492
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 who are lonely, who are sick, who are suffering.

493
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Christmas, if it's anything,

494
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 is a time that reminds us to pick up the call of Jesus

495
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 to follow Him into the real world.

496
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 That world out there that desperately needs the light of Christ

497
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 and it's not a pastor in a building

498
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 that's going to bring that message.

499
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 It's you sitting in these chairs.

500
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 It's you watching online.

501
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 It's the ones that carry the light of Christ in your lives.

502
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Shine brightly, my friends.

503
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 So a light that shines on ourselves,

504
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 a light that shines on the world,

505
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 but also, importantly, a light that shines on God.

506
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 One of the things that Luke and Matthew

507
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 both celebrate in the Christmas story

508
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 is that when Jesus comes as the light of the world,

509
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 He's given a name.

510
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 He is Emmanuel, God with us.

511
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And so, Ellison spoke to the kids about this beautiful truth

512
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 that God is now present with us.

513
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 What that means is when you see Jesus, you see God.

514
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 100% God, 100% human in one form.

515
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 That when we look upon the light of Christ,

516
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 we get to see God in all of His illuminated glory,

517
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 His character, His wonder, His mercy, His power,

518
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 and yes, most importantly,

519
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 His triumph and victory over darkness.

520
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Think about the story that Matthew's just presented for us.

521
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 It is not a fair fight in that story

522
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 because you've got Herod with his mighty armies,

523
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Herod with his spies and informants,

524
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Herod with all the power of the Roman Empire at his disposal,

525
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 trying to hunt down a poor, defenseless mother, father, and child

526
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 who can't even find a proper house to be in,

527
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 but are relegated to a stable with animals.

528
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 This is not a fair fight.

529
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Can you see the difference?

530
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 The power of Rome and the brokenness of an impoverished Jewish family.

531
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And in that, we might think that darkness always wins,

532
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 but we then see the inbreaking of the power of God.

533
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 An angel to Joseph in a dream,

534
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 "Take this child, flee to Egypt. You will be safe there."

535
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Joseph, waking up, obedient to the call of God on his life,

536
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 picking up his child, taking his wife,

537
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 going to Egypt and slipping away.

538
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 When we thought the empire had won, God brings his light again.

539
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And if Christmas is a story of anything,

540
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 it's the story of a God who, when he acts, nothing can stop him.

541
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 No darkness is dark like New Zealand

542
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 that can overpower the light of Christ in this world.

543
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 The great message we have at Christmas,

544
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 the great hope that you have,

545
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 no matter how hard things might be for your life right now,

546
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 and we're all struggling with something in our lives.

547
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 There's all disconcert,

548
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 and there's a sense of worry about our future.

549
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 We're all carrying something,

550
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 but the darkness doesn't get the final say.

551
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 It illuminates the power and the triumph of God.

552
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Jesus would grow, take our sins, go to the cross, be resurrected.

553
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 The church would be birthed by the power of the Spirit of God

554
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 spreading the word from Judea, Samaria, into the ends of the world.

555
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And now the church in our city gathered together,

556
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 strong across the breadth of this city, rising up in 2021.

557
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And it might feel like things are as dark today

558
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 as they were back then in the first century,

559
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 but the light has not been extinguished.

560
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 And may I encourage you,

561
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 as you come out of 2021 into 2022,

562
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 can I encourage you, don't extinguish your light

563
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 because our city here in Hong Kong needs to see it more than ever before.

564
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 I wonder whether we as a church,

565
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 and by that I mean the church of our city, the church of Hong Kong,

566
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 I wonder whether we would make an effort in 2022

567
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 to actually realize that Christ has come to illuminate myself,

568
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 to illuminate the world, to illuminate God,

569
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 and we have a message of hope to bring,

570
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 that if we can go out there into those spirits of influence that we have,

571
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 not with the doom and the gloom and this is all really bad,

572
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 but actually with a new song in our hearts,

573
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 with a new word of hope,

574
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 with the only hope that there is,

575
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Jesus Christ, His light is in you,

576
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 so that you would shine, not for your glory, but for His.

577
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 And I wonder what it would mean

578
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 for you to realize that Jesus is the divine,

579
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 electromagnetic wavelength of this world.

580
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And He is bouncing off of everything out there.

581
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 And when you have eyes to see,

582
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 you will be blown away with the hope that there still is in Hong Kong,

583
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 with the wonder that there still is in this world,

584
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 that no matter what the Herods might try to say and do,

585
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Christ has come.

586
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Christ is here.

587
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Emmanuel with us.

588
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Let there be light.

589
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 In Jesus name, everyone says, Amen.

590
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Would you stand with me? I want to pray for you.

591
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Father, we are so grateful that we have this light.

592
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 So grateful that this light has come into darkness,

593
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 so that we would know darkness doesn't get the final say,

594
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 so that we would be filled with a joy ourselves,

595
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 not just for our own personal salvation,

596
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 as important as that is.

597
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 But also filled with a light

598
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 so that we can be your hands and feet in a dark world.

599
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And Lord, we know that your light shines

600
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 so that we can see the Herods in us.

601
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And so Lord, I want to pray for anyone in this room here at Christmas time

602
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 who knows that there's a couple of Herods that are hanging on,

603
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 a couple of things that they're struggling with.

604
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Lord, I know that you don't want to have anyone in this room

605
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 stepping or online, stepping out of 2021 and 22,

606
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 carrying some of those things with them.

607
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 So Lord, I want to pray for the beauty of the light of conviction

608
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 that shines in our hearts and enables us to deal with our sin.

609
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 And we do that simply by confessing and bringing it to you

610
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 and joyfully handing it to you,

611
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 knowing that we are forgiven and set free.

612
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Lord, I pray that you would change the Herods

613
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 and move us like Joseph into a place of greater faithfulness

614
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 and obedience in the year ahead.

615
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Lord, we don't do it in our strength.

616
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 We do it by the power of your spirit at work in us,

617
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 the light of Christ shining on ourselves.

618
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Lord, I pray you would awaken our eyes to see Hong Kong in 2022

619
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 like never before.

620
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Lord, we don't ignore the realities of a changing political context.

621
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 We don't ignore the realities of a pandemic

622
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 that still is at work in this world.

623
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 But Father, we want to step forward in 2022

624
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 with eyes that see the hope in the darkness,

625
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 eyes that see Christ's light at work,

626
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 eyes that are able to rejoice in the beauty

627
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 that Christ is not reserved to 90 minutes on a Sunday in a building,

628
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 but is vibrant and alive,

629
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 bouncing off of all of the world out there.

630
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Open our eyes to see it, Lord.

631
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And Father, we pray that in 2022 we would see you like never before,

632
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 that you would shine a light on God,

633
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 that we would see your compassion, your love, your mercy, your glory,

634
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 that it would open our eyes,

635
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 and that would be the fuel that would drive us to share the gospel.

636
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Lord, we want 2022 to be a year of harvest for our city,

637
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 2022 to be a year of harvest in our sphere of influence,

638
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 our friends and our families that don't know you.

639
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Lord, would the light of Christ come, Lord?

640
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Lord, I want to pray a prayer of empowerment for people in this room

641
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 who have friends and family that don't know Jesus.

642
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Lord, I pray that their own lives

643
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 would be a light of the gospel shining to them,

644
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 that, Lord, at the right time and in the right way,

645
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 you would fill them with your spirit

646
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 to share the light of the gospel directly with their friends and family.

647
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Father, we want to tell of your story in this world, Lord.

648
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 So fill us with your light.

649
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 So may your light, Lord, drive us onwards.

650
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 And we celebrate this here on Boxing Day in 2021.

651
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Thank you for coming, the light of the world.

652
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 We follow you into the darkness with your light.

653
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

654
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 Everyone says, "Amen, amen."

655
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Why don't we worship together as a congregation?

656
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,400
 communication.
