[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Yes, we have been listening to the story of Joseph.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.080]   So many people say that you can choose your friends, but you can't choose your family.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.840]   But actually, God can do that.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.200]   And he did.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.880]   He intentionally selected his own family from the very beginning.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.720]   And through his divine providence, he guided this family to bring forth a savior for his
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.000]   people.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.600]   The last two weeks, we look at the Genesis chapter 37.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.480]   It establishes the family of Jacob, the 12 brothers.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:54.640]   And also, it tells us about the story of Joseph, that he was sold to Egypt.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:07.280]   If you look back at chapter 37, the last verse of 36, and also if you turn to chapter 39,
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:16.720]   the beginning verse 1, when you look at these two verses, you can find it is almost identical.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:25.640]   One can actually skip chapter 38, but we don't.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.760]   Because it is more than about the story of Joseph.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.880]   It is about the generations of Joseph's father, Jacob.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:49.200]   And it's also about Jacob's family, how God is so faithful to bring his people out of
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.920]   those prisons.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.180]   And also, it is God that is faithful to bless his people after Jacob.
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.300]   And it's about God working behind the scenes through this messy family to build up a nation
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.260]   as he promised.
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:20.940]   So for chapter 38, seems like an odd story in the larger plot of Joseph's narrative.
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.060]   And then suddenly, it turns to a detour to show a moment in the life of Judah and Tamar.
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.900]   So these are the two main characters in chapter 38.
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.380]   And we have a sermon outline here for this slide, yes.
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:50.380]   When we will talk about Judah's unrighteousness, Tamar's righteousness, and also for Judah's
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.620]   redemption.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.460]   So for these two main characters here, Tamar, she is the daughter-in-law of Judah.
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:07.780]   And with her immoral but tragic circumstances, she was given the honor of being the first
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.620]   woman included in Jesus' genealogy.
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.180]   And Judah was one of the sons of Jacob by his first wife, Leah.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.820]   And of course, Judah was not as lucky as Joseph.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.620]   He did not really have the favor and attention and love from his father.
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.180]   And his father, Jacob, did not like, did not love his mother, actually.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:52.860]   So under these circumstances, Judah's mother, Leah, constantly endured rejection and inhumanization
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.420]   in her marriage.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.620]   In Hebrew, Judah means thanksgiving or praise.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.740]   The name was given under the circumstances in which he was born.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:15.780]   Leah's heart changed and turned all her attention away from her pain and bitterness.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.900]   And she decided to name her fourth son, Judah, means praise.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.260]   A sacrifice of praise to God in the midst of difficult situation.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.700]   So as we trace the character development from the beginning, it is quite a miraculous journey
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:44.700]   This is one of the stories that won't get included in the children Bible stories.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.180]   Because it is a little graphic and juicy.
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:59.420]   In chapter 38, it spends about 20 years before the narrative returns to Joseph, continuing
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.940]   his story in chapter 39 to 50.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.380]   So we're going to see the change in Judah at the end of this chapter.
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:18.860]   How God took him from a man who did not really care about his family or doing what was right,
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:27.700]   to the one who was willing to sacrifice to keep the family of God together at all costs.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:34.620]   And through Tamar, Judah learned what it meant to do right for God's people.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:45.380]   The child born of Tamar by Judah ends up being the next link in the lineage of the Messiah.
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:53.360]   And that's why the transformation of Judah here is so important as it is so woven with
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.640]   Joseph's story, which we will see later on.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:07.880]   So please rest assured that God has a purpose to use this story to teach us some lessons.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.280]   So are you ready?
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:25.360]   In the beginning of chapter 38, Judah apparently left his home after Joseph was sold to Egypt.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:32.020]   Actually Judah was the one that suggests this idea and all the other brothers agreed.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.660]   So Joseph was sold.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.540]   So he moved to a town called Adenam.
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.020]   And here he met a lady.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.500]   She is Canaanite and Judah married her.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.460]   This fact is mentioned in passing, but it is important.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:02.140]   There was a history in the family of not intermarrying with the Canaanites due to their pagan tendencies.
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:12.840]   Abraham and Isaac make it very clear to their sons, they should not marry Canaanite women.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.120]   But unfortunately, Judah did.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:23.860]   He and his wife have three children, Ur, Owen, and Shelah.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.460]   When Ur grew up, he married a woman called Tamar.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:35.100]   Tamar, we presume, she also came from a Canaanite family.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.480]   And unfortunately, Ur was a very evil man.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:49.260]   The Bible didn't say how wicked he was, but he was so wicked that so much that God took
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.660]   his life.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:08:00.740]   And then Owen, the next oldest son, was supposed to marry and have a child with Tamar.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:06.280]   This son would be recognized as the son of Ur rather than his own.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:14.300]   It was a custom and also a practice in the Asian Near East, which would be later codified
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:21.460]   in the law of Moses, which was called the law of leverage marriage.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:28.860]   If a man died without a child, his brother was to marry the widow, and the first son
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:35.420]   was regarded as the descendant of the deceased man.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:42.220]   So bearing no children was a source of shame of any woman in the old days.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.060]   Women have no power and have to depend on men.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:54.440]   They could not inherit the land or the wealth of the husbands if he died.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:02.140]   So having a son was very helpful to protect the widow, and the son would now become the
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:07.220]   heir, and she could be secure.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:15.100]   Owen apparently married Tamar, but he did not want to give his brother a child.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.460]   Owen acted in his own interest instead of doing what was right.
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:28.100]   He simply used Tamar for sex, but prevented her from getting pregnant.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:35.380]   And because of his sin, Owen's life was also taken away by God.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:44.740]   Now two of Judah's sons died and have been killed after marrying Tamar.
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.460]   Judah probably was very superstitious about that.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.980]   Maybe she was cursed?
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:57.860]   He was so afraid of Tamar being, in Chinese we say, "hag fu."
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:03.540]   It means it brings bad luck or death to the husband.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:10.980]   So he was very concerned about sending his last and the youngest son, Shelah, to her
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.940]   for fear that he too would die.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:22.660]   And Judah probably didn't know why his two sons were drop dead.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:31.100]   The only thing he knew, well, the two sons married Tamar and they died.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:39.740]   So in verses 11, Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Live as a widow in your father's
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:48.500]   household until my son Shelah grows up, for he thought he may die too, just like his brothers."
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.980]   So Tamar went to live in her father's household.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:02.220]   You see, it would be such a disgrace for Tamar to go back home to his father's house and
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.140]   wait there.
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:10.700]   But she has no choice and left with a false hope.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:18.660]   Judah made Tamar believe he would eventually send his last son to her.
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.460]   But actually, he has no plans to do so.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:27.740]   He was just trying to deceive her and trying to get rid of her.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.700]   Wow.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.820]   Poor Tamar.
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:40.900]   We don't know the exact timeline of the story, but sometime later, Shelah was old enough
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:51.460]   to marry and it was so obvious to Tamar that Judah wasn't going to keep his promise.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:12:00.500]   But Tamar's end goal as a widow, as a woman, as Judah's daughter-in-law, is to preserve
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:08.180]   the family line of Judah so the inheritance and the blessings of God's covenant could
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.180]   continue.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:21.060]   Tamar was so desperate, hopeless, helpless, and lonely without children and provision.
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:27.740]   Last Sunday, Pastor Chapman talked about how Joseph was stuck in the pit.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:34.980]   Likewise, Tamar was also stuck in this family's pit.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.180]   She's simply at the mercy of Judah.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:45.700]   And yet, it's the mercy that Judah refused to give to her.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.700]   He denied Tamar a life and a future.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.100]   So what happened to Tamar was an injustice.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.840]   She was mistreated badly.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:02.620]   She was ultimately facing the reality of being forgotten.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:12.380]   However, she refused to let others define her and she decided to take this matter into
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.180]   her own hands.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:21.420]   And around that time, Judah's wife died.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:31.140]   And after the mourning period, Tamar knew that he had made plans to visit his old friend.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:38.180]   So what she was going to do, she changed out her clothing that identified her as a widow
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:44.000]   and then changed into clothing that made her look different.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.120]   She took a place along the roadside where she knew Judah would pass by.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:59.440]   Sure enough, before Judah came that way, the reaction or the interaction between Judah
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:07.560]   and Tamar was remarkably devoid of romance.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.480]   Let's read verses 15.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:19.840]   When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face, not realizing
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:27.360]   that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, "Come
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.240]   now, let me sleep with you."
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.280]   "And what will you give me to sleep with you?" she asked.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:41.640]   "I send you a young goat from my flock.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.920]   Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?"
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.040]   "Hmm, what pledge should I give you?"
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:58.560]   "Your seal is caught and the staff in your hand."
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.260]   So Judah gave them to her and slept with her.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.520]   And she became pregnant by him.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:14.960]   After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow's clothes again.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:24.880]   The seal that Judah gave Tamar was probably his ring, used for impressing his signature
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.040]   in the clay tablets of the time.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.240]   And it was worn on a cord around the neck.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:39.440]   And the staff was often carved with some identifying symbol of its owner.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:49.560]   So what Judah gave Tamar was like in the present day, like an ID card or a passport, which
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:56.980]   was a very unique item as a defining mark of its owner.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.000]   It was quite shocking.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.520]   Judah could lightly forfeit his possessions.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   He easily just gave up his possessions for the sake of a moment of lust.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:23.280]   And three months later, when Tamar was found to be pregnant, Judah was outraged and demanded
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   her to put her to death by burning her for the shame she has brought to the family.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.560]   Church, can you see the double standard of Judah here?
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:46.760]   It's so easy to accuse and point the fingers to others of wrongdoing, isn't it?
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:53.440]   This kind of double standard is very common in our society.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:02.160]   Jesus said in Luke, "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eyes and
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.960]   pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?"
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.000]   Judah had made his daughter-in-law pregnant.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.440]   He did not even care or want to ask what had happened to her.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:25.800]   He condemned her, even though he was just as guilty, shameful, and unfaithful by not
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:31.560]   sending the last son to her.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:40.000]   Judah possibly sensed this is a wonderful opportunity to get rid of Tamar, such an ominous
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   person, once and for all, to execute her.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:55.160]   Well, he didn't seem to have a problem walking down the road and recruiting a prostitute
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.760]   three months ago.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:04.000]   And actually, he is the one that has shamed the family by not leading them in the ways
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.360]   of righteousness.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:12.840]   And now, suddenly, it was Tamar's action, punishable by death.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:20.000]   He should have said, "Oh, excuse me, burn me too."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.240]   And like Judah, here we are often quick to condemn others.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:33.320]   And while at the same time overlooking our own sin, we may be holding a standard for
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:39.400]   someone else while living a completely different way.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:49.000]   We have a tendency to downplay or fail to recognize our own wrongdoing while being more
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.700]   critical to others.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:19:01.920]   May God help us to open our eyes, to raise our awareness, promote greater empathy, and
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:10.560]   make a conscious effort to treat everyone fairly, regardless of their gender, background,
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.000]   or social status, et cetera.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.040]   So let's move on.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   Verse 25, she was being brought out to send a message to her father-in-law, "I'm pregnant
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.440]   by the man who owns this," she said.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:38.880]   And she added, "See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are."
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:45.440]   Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't give her
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:53.320]   my son, Sheleh, and he did not sleep with her again."
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:20:00.200]   Before Tamar was burned, she delivered some shocking news.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   She's pregnant by the man who gave her this seal, cord, and staff.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:13.400]   And of course, immediately Judah recognized his personal items.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:20.920]   In God, he didn't say, "Oh, I'm lonely," or "Oh, my wife died," you know?
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.320]   Or Tamar, "Why did you trick me?"
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:33.920]   Instead of justifying his own actions or making excuses, at that moment, Judah had a clear
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.420]   realization of what had happened.
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:46.520]   And because of his sin in not fulfilling his promise to Tamar, and his sin in engaging
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:54.640]   a prostitute, he confessed that Tamar was more righteous than he was.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.640]   Yes, she was.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:05.920]   And you see, Tamar was the only one that was so cared about the family line of Judah, far
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.680]   more than anybody else.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.120]   She risked her life.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.580]   She risked her life in her own expenses.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:24.280]   And she hold fast to the promise that were given to this family.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:33.680]   Tamar displayed such an ordinary act of faith, determination, and courage.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:43.200]   Like Tamar, are we willing to put our trust in God when we face challenge and stand up
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:57.080]   for what is right for others and for ourselves, and to seek justice?
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:03.200]   God allowed Tamar to achieve triumph over this situation.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.120]   Not only God cared about her, God loved her.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.320]   God knew her situation.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.920]   God produced much good out of what has been a great evil.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:21.560]   Church, we all have a role in God's story.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:29.920]   Can we maintain our faith and resilience in God's plan and purpose when we do not understand
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.760]   our hardship?
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:40.160]   The Bible accurately records what people did.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:48.880]   Certain behaviors appearing in the Bible does not mean God endorses these behaviors.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.920]   Both Judah and Tamar engaged in a sinful activity.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:00.520]   But sin is not really the heart of the story.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.240]   Sin is not a surprise.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:18.480]   When sin is exposed and thrown under the spotlight, what happened in the next instance is important.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:30.120]   Acknowledging Tamar's righteousness and his wrongdoing was the first step in Judah's transformation.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:41.160]   In this moment of realizing and in this moment of brokenness, Judah has repented and God
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.480]   redeemed him.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:55.200]   Judah's life provides an example of how God can transform and use anybody, any of
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.680]   us for his purpose.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:08.160]   In verses 26, the scripture here said, "And he did not sleep with her again," implying
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:15.480]   that Judah did not take advantage of her situation for his own gain.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:23.480]   But instead, he respected Tamar and provided for her as a family.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.280]   Repentance is not just acknowledging, "Oh, I did wrong.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.200]   I was wrong."
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:40.320]   Not only that, it involves turning away from our wrongdoing and starting to live a brand
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:47.640]   new life, to live a different life.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:57.200]   God transformed an act steeped in such immorality into an extraordinary blessing, demonstrating
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:03.800]   his amazing work of providence and redemption.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:12.280]   Later, we will see in chapter 44, Judah was willing to give up his freedom, even his own
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:18.160]   life to rescue his brother Benjamin.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   And the tribe of Judah was the largest.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:29.520]   And he, the tribe of Judah, was the leader of the other 11 tribes.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:37.240]   And he was also privileged, being part of the lineage of the Messiah.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:43.880]   Judah's name was written on the gates of the heavenly Jerusalem, according to the book
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.640]   of Revelation.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:26:04.120]   Church, we live in the days when the behavior of Judah and Tamar are very, very common.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:10.760]   But there's no restriction of God doing what he intends to do.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:20.800]   We can look at Judah and Tamar and easily write them off as lost causes, worthless to
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.440]   be used by God.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:33.780]   But God, with his mercy and grace, worked and transformed their lives and used such
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:42.400]   a black mark in their lives to become an agent of blessings for God, for their family, and
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.200]   for others in the future.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:58.360]   So the book of Genesis, chapter 38, here it reminds us that there is a hope for all sinners.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:06.960]   God's loving kindness often comes through confronting our ugliness and allowing us so
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.280]   honestly see our wrongdoing.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.960]   And this humble us, this reveal our need.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:21.320]   We are so much to need our Savior.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:29.880]   We are so much need for his forgiveness, his mercy, for his grace, and for his redemption.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:37.460]   And these are such beautiful gifts God always ready to offer to us.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:43.640]   And God blesses us beyond what we deserve.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.680]   And he is ready.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.640]   Are you ready?
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.040]   pray.
