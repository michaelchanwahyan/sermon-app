1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
 It's so good that you are here.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,240
 Welcome to The Vine.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,240
 This is your first time.

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,240
 We're glad you're with us.

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,480
 My name is Andrew, one of the pastors here.

6
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,520
 And it is great to be in God's presence.

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,420
 And like Promise so beautifully reminded us, he is in this house, he is in this place,

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,520
 but he's not just in this place.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,120
 And we're going to spend the next four weeks opening up for us some of the ways in which

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:31,920
 God is in a place in us that we desperately need, but so often never talk about.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,400
 I want to sit with something with you over the next four weeks.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,120
 It's a little bit like that prayer we just prayed.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,720
 You know that prayer of God, whatever you want to in my life, is a prayer that Jesus

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,100
 prayed.

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,560
 It's a prayer that so many people prayed in scripture.

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:57,120
 It's that prayer that opens us up for a profound work and a move by the body of Christ in us.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,520
 And I want to start it by saying some words over you that I think are really important

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,800
 for you to hear this morning, and it's this.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,600
 It is okay for you not to be okay.

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,440
 I'm going to say that again.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,960
 It is okay to not be okay.

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,520
 I heard those words spoken over me by my counselor whilst I was sitting in his office, slumped

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,980
 on his therapist's couch, overwhelmed and struggling with the reality that I had chronic

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,360
 anxiety in my life.

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,920
 Three months prior to that, I was sitting in a meeting in the investment bank that I

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
 was working in at the time, and I was sitting in a meeting that I'd sat in many, many times

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,520
 before, and as I'm sitting in that meeting, I suddenly am overwhelmed with a sense of

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,900
 panic.

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,200
 Suddenly out of the blue, I'm overwhelmed with a sense of anxiety that rises up inside

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,160
 of me, and I didn't expect it.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,640
 I'd never experienced it before.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,900
 I didn't know exactly what was happening.

33
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,320
 My heart rate increased.

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,400
 My body temperature soared.

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,120
 I wanted to get out of that room as quickly as possible.

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,520
 I had to sit through that meeting.

37
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,680
 I don't know how I got through that meeting.

38
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,560
 I got outside straightaway afterwards.

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,200
 I paced around the office.

40
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,880
 I was trying to find some way to find the ground under my feet again, and my thought

41
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,560
 was, "Well, I don't really know what's happening here, but I guess this is just a moment I

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,480
 need to get through."

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,000
 I wonder how many of us in this room have faced an overwhelming and emotional attack

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 on us and have thought, "This is just a moment I need to get through," but it wasn't a moment

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
 for me.

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,920
 I woke up the next day with exactly the same feeling, and the day after that, and the day

47
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
 after that, and the day after that.

48
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,440
 The feeling was this rising sense of fear in me for something is going to happen in

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,080
 my future, which is going to be a calamity.

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,440
 I couldn't quite put my mind on that.

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,960
 I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I woke up every morning feeling like something

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,240
 terrible is about to happen.

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,160
 This was incredibly painful.

54
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,180
 What it meant was that I was fighting the whole day to try to get my body and my emotions

55
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,180
 in mind.

56
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,240
 Because I was so tense, I would get home at night and collapse into bed, exhausted physically

57
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,240
 from the emotional battle that was happening inside of me.

58
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,720
 This was day in and day out.

59
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,560
 I told no one about it, because you don't, do you?

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,240
 You don't want everybody else to think you're weak, that you're not strong enough.

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,000
 This is particularly how you think when you work in an investment bank.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,160
 I was there, and I was like, "I don't want any of my colleagues to know that I'm weak

63
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
 here.

64
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,880
 I don't want any of my colleagues to know that I'm out of control.

65
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,680
 We're here as a bank.

66
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,840
 We've got to show ourselves to be sturdy and faithful and committed and professional and

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
 true."

68
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,840
 And all these things were what I was projecting outwardly, but inwardly I was being torn up

69
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,960
 inside.

70
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,760
 And I was fearful of letting my colleagues know how I felt for how they would judge me

71
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,280
 and think that I was weak.

72
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,360
 I was also fearful from telling people because of pride, pride inside of myself that said,

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,440
 "This is what those with mental health problems suffer.

74
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,120
 This is not people like me who suffer these things, people who are successful, people

75
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,480
 who are professional, people who work in great companies.

76
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
 No, we don't suffer this stuff.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,040
 That's for the other people."

78
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,880
 That pride kept my mouth shut when I desperately needed someone to help me.

79
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,060
 About a month into it, I turned to my beautiful wife, Christine, and I finally had the courage

80
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,200
 to tell her what was happening.

81
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,240
 My wife is now a counselor, but in those days she wasn't.

82
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,040
 She said straight away to me, "You need to get help.

83
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,160
 You need to seek professional help."

84
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,280
 And my response was, "No, that's what people with mental health issues do.

85
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
 They go to counselors.

86
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,360
 And if I go to a counselor, that's admitting something that I'm not prepared to admit.

87
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,440
 If I go to a counselor, that's what you do when you're out of control.

88
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,360
 That's what you do when you have no other solutions.

89
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,320
 That's what you do when you're at the end of your rope."

90
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,080
 And so for the next month, I tried to manage my anxiety through a whole bunch of healthy

91
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,960
 and mostly really unhealthy ways.

92
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,000
 At the end of that month, I'm still struggling.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
 I'm still overwhelmed.

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,560
 I'm still barely making it through the day, but I finally asked a friend for a referral

95
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,120
 to a counselor, and I find myself in his office, slumped on his couch.

96
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
 And the first thing he says to me after I've explained to him how I've been suffering for

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:31,680
 two months is, "It's okay, you know, to not be okay."

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,240
 That started me on a two-year journey of trying to deal with the anxiety in my life through

99
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,040
 therapy, hard work, a lot of prayer, many times turning to Jesus, incredible support

100
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:54,160
 of my wife and the church here, seasons of medication to keep my chemical balance in

101
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,960
 my body and my mind right, fighting a good fight.

102
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:07,440
 And I stand before you today, and I can say that anxiety is still a co-passenger on the

103
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,800
 journey of my life.

104
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,360
 It's still something that I'm struggling with right now.

105
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,920
 In fact, I felt anxious before this service.

106
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,640
 It's still something that is a reality to me.

107
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:23,720
 I may not be crippled by it like I was in that first time and in those two years, but

108
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,960
 anxiety is still a part of my daily journey.

109
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,840
 It's still something that I have to bring constantly to the feet of Jesus.

110
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,200
 And I wonder whether you in this room, you might be resonating with something like this.

111
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,400
 Maybe you haven't had a similar journey to me, but maybe you've experienced times in

112
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,040
 your life of emotional exhaustion, times in your life where things are just overwhelming

113
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
 you.

114
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,000
 Maybe over the last two to three years as we've all gone through COVID, when we felt

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,200
 more and more out of control, maybe you felt like you were grasping at straws and you felt

116
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,120
 like you were wondering why you were suddenly feeling fear and anxiety or depression or

117
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,080
 sadness in ways that you'd never felt before.

118
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,960
 And the reality is that as the world has emerged from COVID, we're all struggling with something

119
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,360
 that people are generally not speaking about, and that's mental health.

120
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,880
 I mean, around the world right now, we're seeing a mental health crisis, and I would

121
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,980
 say here without overstating it, that Hong Kong is struggling with a mental health crisis

122
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,180
 right now, and people are generally not really talking about it.

123
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,000
 In fact, there's a number of NGOs here that do work in this area that are desperately

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,920
 trying to get the conversation going around the realities of mental health and how we

125
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,440
 can get help in that space.

126
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,120
 And over the last year, they produced a lot of research and reports, and I want to share

127
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,000
 you a few things today to help you understand, I think, the context that we're in in Hong

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,880
 Kong at this time.

129
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,480
 One of these NGOs created a research project, and in that research project, they basically

130
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:55,800
 said about 61% of Hong Kong adults are currently suffering from a low sense of mental well-being,

131
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,120
 61% of Hong Kong people.

132
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,940
 They also said in this that one in seven Hong Kong adults will at some point in their lives

133
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:14,980
 develop a diagnosed and understood mental health disorder, one in seven.

134
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:21,940
 Another NGO did a research over 1,000 people taken at random across a broad spectrum of

135
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,420
 the socionomic demographic here in Hong Kong, and here's what they found.

136
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,460
 They found that there was about, I think it was around about 56% of the people that they

137
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:37,820
 surveyed who actually came out low on the World Health Organization mental wellness

138
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,820
 spectrum.

139
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,900
 So the World Health Organization has a spectrum for understanding how mental health is, and

140
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,420
 out of this survey of 1,000 random people in Hong Kong, 56% of them would rank low on

141
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,420
 that spectrum.

142
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:58,080
 48% of them admitted to feeling either mild to severe symptoms of depression.

143
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,380
 But here was the overwhelmingly sobering statistic.

144
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:10,300
 Out of all of these people that were interviewed, 74% of them said they would not ever seek

145
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,460
 professional help.

146
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,700
 Need to think about this, guys, because this is how we define a mental health crisis.

147
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,660
 We have a rising mental health reality and issue in our city, and we have a society that

148
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:31,240
 over 74% of us will refuse to seek professional help.

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,200
 That should concern us as a society.

150
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,020
 That should concern us in the church, but often it doesn't, because when we hear statistics

151
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,580
 like that, we think, "Oh, yeah, that's what all the people without faith stuff are with."

152
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,180
 But us with faith, we're awesome.

153
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,180
 We're good.

154
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
 God's with us.

155
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,180
 It's all cool, right?

156
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:55,220
 And the reality is our statistics will be as bad, if not worse, than those.

157
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,420
 See here's the reality.

158
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:03,300
 Mental health is one of the least talked about topics in the global church today.

159
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,180
 Not only that, but those that struggle with mental health in church communities are one

160
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,980
 of the most marginalized and poorly treated communities within churches.

161
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,260
 See, we're not talking about it, therefore we're not responding to it.

162
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:26,540
 And if we're not responding to it, then we're not being an option in society to how actually

163
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,500
 mental health could be understood, could be recognized, could be met, and potentially

164
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,140
 over time, people could be free of some of these things that they struggle with.

165
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:43,740
 And yet as a church, we've generally taken the route of saying spiritual issues are far

166
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,140
 more important than mental and emotional ones.

167
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,780
 And I want to say this, that is not good enough.

168
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,060
 Come on, church.

169
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,780
 That is not good enough.

170
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:03,020
 It's not good enough because contrary to the apathy seen in the church, the Bible is filled

171
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,060
 with stories of people struggling with mental health issues.

172
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,780
 In fact, you look through the pages of the Old Testament and the New Testament, you'll

173
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:17,500
 see people struggling, suffering under physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual issues in

174
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 their lives.

175
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,300
 And in fact, some of the most important figures in Scripture are men and women who struggle

176
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,060
 with fear, struggle with anxiety, struggle with depression, people who struggle with

177
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,220
 having a positive attitude towards the future.

178
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,100
 And if you're sitting in this room here right now and any of those things are something

179
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,100
 that you're aware of, if any of those things are a part of your general experience of life,

180
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:48,020
 then you're in good hands because some of the greatest leaders of faith have been some

181
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,260
 of the people that have struggled the most.

182
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,420
 You guys okay?

183
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,780
 So in the next four weeks, I want to take you on a bit of a journey.

184
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:03,220
 I want to open up some of this reality to us of mental health and what that means for

185
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,220
 us.

186
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,820
 And I want us obviously to do this through a lens of Scripture and through a lens of

187
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,620
 the Spirit of God.

188
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:15,220
 And I want to start by sharing four things that I think the church is doing wrong in

189
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,420
 this area that I think we need to address.

190
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,200
 The first is this.

191
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,820
 When it comes to mental health, how so often it is thought about, we are tempted to think

192
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:34,700
 about it primarily as a mental thing impacting our brain that we need to find some diagnosis

193
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,980
 for so that we can solve it and get well again.

194
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,740
 When we think of mental health, we're tempted to largely think about it from an issue of

195
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,100
 this person has this diagnosis, therefore, they need to do this to get well.

196
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,460
 Now, don't hear me wrong.

197
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,740
 Diagnosing mental health conditions is an important part of the process.

198
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,660
 But when that is the primary lens through which it's viewed, people end up being labeled

199
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,060
 by their diagnosis.

200
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,300
 We come to actually expect or speak of people as their identity is this.

201
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,500
 This person is depressed.

202
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,900
 And we kind of make something like that the biggest part of who they are.

203
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,420
 This Bible does not speak about mental health in these kind of categories.

204
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,820
 When the Bible approaches the topic of mental health, it actually doesn't approach it from

205
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
 the topic of diagnosis.

206
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,140
 It approaches it from the topic of persons and a theology of suffering.

207
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,420
 In other words, what it says is that our mental anguish and our emotional struggles are a

208
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,540
 part of a bigger and broader thing of our suffering in general, and God cares about

209
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,860
 our suffering.

210
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,380
 The Bible looks at us as persons.

211
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,280
 And because He looks at us as persons, He looks at us holistically.

212
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,220
 And when He does that, I am not a diagnosis to God.

213
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,900
 Can I have an amen?

214
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,700
 I'm not a diagnosis to God.

215
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,700
 I'm a person whom He loves, who He died for, so that I would know the fullness of His power

216
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,700
 and His resurrection spirit in me.

217
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:04,940
 And when He sees me, He sees the totality of me and my mental health journey, my challenges

218
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,140
 in that area are a part of the wholeness of who I am.

219
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:15,420
 And God has compassion for me, and He sees me in my suffering, and He meets me in it.

220
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,100
 When we put mental health in this broader picture of suffering, we learn two things.

221
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,180
 God cares about it, and God wants us to talk about it and deal with it amongst ourselves.

222
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,580
 He wants us to be communal in it.

223
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,820
 All suffering that we experience, God is in it and present with it.

224
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,300
 He has compassion for it.

225
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:41,660
 He cares about it, and He wants the community of the body of Christ to be each other's best

226
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,500
 support.

227
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,660
 So rather than being this kind of black and white mental diagnostic thing, within Scripture

228
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,140
 it becomes so much more a part of the way we've been created to be as human beings,

229
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:58,580
 made in the image of God, and a God who cares and loves and creates us and meets us personally

230
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,580
 in whatever journey we're in.

231
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,140
 Here's the second thing.

232
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,620
 The Bible is not a diagnostic manual.

233
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,380
 It is not designed for us to go into it with any mental health issue and try to find one

234
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,500
 cural prayer that if we prayed this thing, everything else is going to be fine.

235
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,260
 If we can just find that one prayer in the Bible that sets me fine again, then I need

236
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,100
 to find that prayer and I need to pray it.

237
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,380
 The Bible doesn't approach this issue that way, and I think many times in Scripture and

238
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,180
 many times in the church, we actually encourage people to do that, and what happens is they

239
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,580
 go into the Bible looking for some diagnostic help, but actually the Bible doesn't provide

240
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,060
 that, and therefore they become even more distant with God in the midst of the suffering

241
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,740
 that they've already got.

242
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,780
 Are you with me?

243
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
 Here's the third thing.

244
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,620
 Perhaps the most important.

245
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:52,380
 We need to stop saying and thinking that all mental health is the result of somebody's

246
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,240
 sin.

247
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,640
 Is God's punishment for the things that they have done in their past or that they're currently

248
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,140
 doing right now?

249
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,980
 See, so often in the church, we have this idea, this thought in us that mental health,

250
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,220
 if somebody is suffering from mental health, it's because there must be some sin going

251
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,380
 on in their life or some sin that they haven't repented of, and if they only just repented,

252
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,660
 then everything would be fine again.

253
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,420
 See, the reason why we do this is because Christians in particular, but human beings

254
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:28,140
 in a broader sense, want to find simplistic answers to complex problems, and mental health

255
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,780
 is a complex issue.

256
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,820
 It's so complex, but we want to find a simple answer to it, so if we can funnel it all down

257
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,220
 to sin, then we can place sin in a box, and we know how to deal with sin.

258
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,100
 It's just repent, and then everything will be fine.

259
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:49,820
 Here's the reality that we have to grapple with, that mental health is an incredibly

260
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:57,340
 complex issue, and the majority of mental health challenge that comes, comes not because

261
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,540
 of sin, but because of trauma.

262
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,580
 Listen to this, church.

263
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:10,780
 It happens because of trauma, and on the whole, trauma is something that happens to you.

264
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,900
 This does not mean, of course, that our sin cannot create trauma for us.

265
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,900
 Your sin and your poor choices can create trauma that will bring you into a mental health

266
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,420
 challenge, absolutely, but the majority of mental health challenge that we suffer with

267
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:31,620
 is because of a trauma that has happened because something is actually out of our control,

268
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,740
 and because it's out of our control, our thinking and our feelings are overwhelmed because we

269
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,540
 can't control this thing.

270
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,860
 Human beings love to be in control, and when we're out of control, that brings us into

271
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,220
 a place where mentally and emotionally we're in anguish and we're suffering.

272
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,180
 It's trauma rather than specifically sin.

273
00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:02,900
 You see, when the Bible talks about suffering, it does so by focusing not so much on sin,

274
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:10,180
 but on a pathway of God in our suffering who meets us in it and works us through it into

275
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,860
 a place of hope and health again.

276
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,460
 So the Bible's focus, when it talks about suffering, is actually not to speak about

277
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,460
 sin.

278
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,960
 Yes, there are some places in Scripture where that happens, but if you look at the totality

279
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,380
 of the Bible's discussion on suffering, the focus is not sin.

280
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,580
 The focus is actually on a pathway of God meeting us in our suffering, walking us through

281
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,100
 it and bringing us to hope.

282
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,980
 In other words, the focus on this issue is always towards hope.

283
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,540
 And if that's the case, then I think the church should focus on the things that the Bible

284
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,700
 focuses on in this area.

285
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,140
 Here's the fourth and final thing.

286
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,020
 The depth of your faith will not determine your success or failure in this area.

287
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,260
 Oh, come on, church.

288
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,960
 The depth of your faith is not going to impact the success or failure in this area.

289
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
 We so often think this in the church.

290
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,580
 We think that strong people of faith will not suffer mental health issues.

291
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,700
 And therefore, what we're implying is that those that struggle with mental health issues

292
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,580
 are actually the weak ones of faith.

293
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,140
 I need you to hear this because it's really, really important.

294
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,100
 A mental health challenge is not a weakness of faith.

295
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:30,780
 It is a situation you are experiencing within which your faith can help you to navigate.

296
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,580
 Come on, church.

297
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
 Somebody please be here.

298
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,580
 Are you here?

299
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,860
 Are you with me?

300
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,420
 It's not a weakness of faith, but your faith can help, of course, as you journey in that

301
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,580
 process of struggling with mental health and wanting to move to that place of hope as you

302
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,180
 understand God's with you.

303
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,020
 Faith can help you to navigate, but your reality of the mental health condition you might be

304
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,420
 facing is not a lack of your faith.

305
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,940
 It is not that you are weak.

306
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:03,380
 Someone said to me two weeks ago that true Christians cannot become depressed.

307
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:10,100
 And this sits at the heart of why this is an issue in the church and why over the next

308
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,620
 four weeks we're going to break some of those taboos and we're going to speak about it.

309
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,980
 And I want to do that today by taking you to an intro.

310
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,940
 I want to introduce a bit around this topic and a bit around my journey in this topic

311
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,500
 by taking you to a passage that I think is really, really important to help us to begin

312
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,700
 to fully understand what God does in the midst of some of these incredible challenges that

313
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
 we face.

314
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,140
 And I want to take you to Paul, one of the great, great leaders of the church, if not

315
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,900
 the greatest leader you could argue of the church, who struggled deeply with mental health

316
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,900
 issues.

317
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,260
 I want to show you one of those examples where it becomes too much for him.

318
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,220
 This is 2 Corinthians 12, verse 7.

319
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,140
 Is this helping somebody so far?

320
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,340
 Somebody feeling ministered to already?

321
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,260
 Okay, we're about to go into the Word.

322
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,180
 Now it's less me and more Scripture.

323
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,180
 Amen?

324
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,180
 All right, good.

325
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,300
 2 Corinthians 12, verse 7.

326
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,500
 To keep me from becoming conceited because of these unsurpassing great revelations, there

327
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:12,180
 was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me.

328
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,660
 Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away, but he said to me, "My grace is sufficient

329
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,220
 for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.

330
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,340
 Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that Christ's power

331
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,420
 may rest also on me.

332
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,860
 This is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in

333
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,540
 persecutions, in difficulties.

334
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,260
 For when I am weak, then I am strong.

335
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,340
 When my anxiety is upon me, I have been in some of my weakest moments.

336
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:51,180
 But in my weakest moments, I can stand before you today and declare I was my strongest."

337
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,220
 Paul mentions something here.

338
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,660
 He calls it a thorn in the flesh.

339
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,140
 The word for thorn is the word scallop.

340
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,580
 It sounds like scallops, but it's scallop with an O.

341
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,740
 Scallops means a sharp and pointed thing.

342
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,260
 That's all it means, a sharp and pointed thing.

343
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,700
 And Paul uses this idea in a metaphorical way here.

344
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:17,020
 And he goes on to say that this sharp and pointed thing was at work in me.

345
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,620
 Now scholars actually don't know what the thorn is.

346
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,340
 Paul never defines the thorn.

347
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,340
 It's one of those annoying things.

348
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,080
 It's like, "Paul, why didn't you just tell us what the thorn was?"

349
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,380
 And scholars have had fun over centuries trying to decide what the thorn was, right?

350
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,220
 This is what scholars kind of get up to, right?

351
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,780
 And they've come up with three ideas.

352
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,180
 One is that maybe it was a physical impairment like his eyesight.

353
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,620
 And later on in his life, he definitely struggled with his eyesight.

354
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,300
 Or maybe it was people or an opposition that was brought against his ministry.

355
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,660
 And he was struggling to fight off this personal opposition by somebody to his ministry.

356
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,780
 Or maybe thirdly, it was emotional baggage that he was carrying around with him from

357
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,420
 the years that he used to persecute Christians.

358
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,320
 And now he's working and leading a church and in the churches.

359
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,320
 And maybe he's got this emotional baggage that's driving him.

360
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,520
 We don't know what the thorn was, but it doesn't matter.

361
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,820
 The thorn is not the point.

362
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,060
 What's the point is what the thorn did to him.

363
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,120
 And he describes here, "It tormented me."

364
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,240
 The word for torment there is the Greek word kozosphizo.

365
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,300
 And kozosphizo literally means this.

366
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,500
 It means to be beaten.

367
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
 It means to be smashed.

368
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,780
 It means to be physically pummeled and hit and hard.

369
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,980
 This word is only repeated one at a time in the whole of the New Testament.

370
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,660
 And it's found right at the moment where Jesus is being beaten up before he goes on the cross.

371
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,820
 And I think Paul chooses this word specifically because he's trying to communicate to his

372
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,740
 church the mental and emotional torment he's going through because of the thorn.

373
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,900
 He's like, "It's like every day I'm getting beaten up.

374
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,260
 It's like every day I feel like I'm being pummeled and smacked and hit.

375
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,980
 I feel like what Jesus went through before he went to the cross, how he was beaten bloody

376
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:08,420
 by the people who had imprisoned him, that's only the way I can describe the mental and

377
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,420
 emotional toil and anguish that I was going through.

378
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,540
 It tormented me in such a way.

379
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,140
 Like me when I got home at night and collapsed in the bed because I was physically exhausted,

380
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,420
 Paul's saying to his church, "I'm physically exhausted.

381
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,820
 I'm totally tormented.

382
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,620
 Physically and emotionally, this thing is too much for me."

383
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,840
 And so because of that, he does something.

384
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,700
 He pleads with the Lord three times for it to be taken away.

385
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,340
 The word "plead" there literally means to beg.

386
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,980
 This is not some sort of, "Jesus, if you'd like to, it'd be awesome if you could take

387
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
 this away."

388
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,100
 This is like literally he's begging.

389
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,260
 He's on his knees.

390
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,760
 He's crying out because he's tormented by this thing.

391
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,780
 And he's asking God to come and do something that only God can do.

392
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,140
 Three times he goes before God.

393
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,900
 And I want you to know this.

394
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,700
 Whatever suffering you ever have in your life, your first response should always to plead

395
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,700
 to the Lord for him to heal you.

396
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,300
 We believe in healing here at the Vine.

397
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,200
 We believe in the power of Christ to heal people.

398
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,060
 And that healing happens sometimes in an instant.

399
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,580
 I've been in a room in the Philippines where one of our youth prayed for somebody who was

400
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,660
 blind, and I saw him receive sight immediately.

401
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:26,660
 It was a New Testament miracle that I cannot explain to you.

402
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,260
 It was unbelievable.

403
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,420
 I've seen God step in and do things that you could never, ever expect.

404
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,580
 I've seen God heal people, redeem people.

405
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,220
 I've seen demons cast out of people.

406
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,300
 I've even seen demons cast out of people inside these services on Sundays.

407
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:46,420
 I've seen some incredible things, but I've also seen my journey.

408
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,340
 And I've seen my journey where just like Paul, I can't tell you the number of times I've

409
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,380
 prayed to be free of anxiety.

410
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,500
 The number of times I've asked God, "Would you come?"

411
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,700
 Begging him, "Come on, God.

412
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,820
 I need to pass through this church well.

413
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,660
 I can't pass through this church well if I'm overwhelmed with anxiety all the time.

414
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,460
 If I'm trying to just keep my mind together, how could I even possibly hope to speak of

415
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,260
 Jesus to the people in a room on a Sunday?

416
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,620
 Lord, you need to take this from me."

417
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,180
 And Paul's there going, "I got a church to build.

418
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,340
 I got stuff to do.

419
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,780
 I want to bring salvation to the Gentiles and the whole Greek and Roman Empire.

420
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,460
 God, remove this thing from me."

421
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,740
 The first thing we do is we ask him and we come to him and we will do that for you.

422
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,180
 If you're struggling with something in your life right now, if there's a suffering going

423
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,140
 on, if there's something that's overwhelming you, after this service, stay behind.

424
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,860
 We will pray for you and we will pray that God heals and delivers you.

425
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,260
 But for Paul, God didn't.

426
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:52,020
 And I am so grateful that we have this passage in the Bible, because for me, God didn't.

427
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,580
 And maybe for some of you in this room, maybe there's some emotional toil you've been struggling

428
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
 with.

429
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,460
 Maybe there's a long-term mental health issue that you're trying to keep under wraps and

430
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,780
 you're trying to keep control of.

431
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:10,300
 And maybe you prayed many times for it to go and it has not gone.

432
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:18,300
 And rather than deliver Paul, God does something here that I think has so much to say and so

433
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,820
 much help to bring any of us that are struggling with some mental health issue.

434
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:30,420
 See, rather than remove the suffering, what God does in this moment is he leads Paul to

435
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,820
 redefine the suffering.

436
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,900
 I want to show you something here in the verse 7.

437
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,100
 He says, "To keep me from becoming conceited."

438
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,340
 Paul is so honest with his church.

439
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,060
 Man, this is an open, broken book before his church.

440
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,820
 He's like, "To keep me from becoming conceited."

441
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,460
 This is a realization Paul had after God told him that he wasn't going to heal him.

442
00:27:53,460 --> 00:28:00,020
 In fact, I would argue that God's no to him was the catalyst for him to have such a deep

443
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,980
 revelation of what God needs to do in his life.

444
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,140
 That prayer we prayed at the start of this, at the end of worship time, "Lord, have your

445
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,420
 way in me."

446
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,860
 It's like Paul came to God and said, "Have your way in me."

447
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,340
 And God said, "I'm doing this because you're conceited."

448
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,980
 You really want to know how I feel about you, Paul?

449
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,540
 You got pride in you.

450
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,220
 There's something going on deep inside of you that I need to speak to and deal with

451
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,220
 in your life.

452
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:32,420
 And to keep you from continuing to operate out of pride, rather than heal you like you

453
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,780
 would, I'm going to meet you in it.

454
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,780
 And we're going to journey together.

455
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,420
 And we're going to do some things.

456
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:42,620
 And you're going to experience my power in your life like you've never experienced before,

457
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:48,020
 because my power is made glorious in your weakness.

458
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,540
 Would you bring your weakness to me?"

459
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,060
 He says to Paul.

460
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,420
 Paul says, "To stop me from becoming conceited."

461
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,140
 He was conceited before he met Jesus.

462
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,820
 He was conceited because he was a Pharisee above all Pharisees.

463
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,780
 He was a Hebrew of all Hebrews.

464
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,820
 He was somebody who, by his own word, actually was advanced well beyond his years.

465
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,520
 He was an A+ student.

466
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,380
 He was the kind of guy that every parent in Hong Kong wanted to have.

467
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,620
 That was Paul.

468
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,620
 And he got puffed up.

469
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,940
 And he was proud about it.

470
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,580
 And then when he became a Christian, when you think that that would set him free from

471
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,660
 all that, he says, "I had surpassingly great revelations to deal with.

472
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,420
 Now not only was I an amazing Pharisee above Pharisees, but I'm also the number one Christian

473
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,260
 there ever was.

474
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,980
 Now God's given me unsurpassingly great revelations.

475
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,540
 And in order to keep me grounded, in order to keep me humble, in order to keep me realizing

476
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:45,260
 that it's only ever the power and the grace and the beauty and the love and the work of

477
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,980
 God, God kept me in a place where I might have been tormented, but He was there.

478
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,540
 He kept me in a place where although I wanted to be free from it, it was where I needed

479
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,180
 to be because there was something He was going to show me that I could not experience unless

480
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,860
 I was in that place."

481
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
 God says this.

482
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:12,660
 Jesus says this, verse 9, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."

483
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:19,620
 Rather than his healing, God wanted Paul to have his power.

484
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,180
 Those two things can sometimes be different.

485
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,600
 Think about that for a minute.

486
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:33,580
 Rather than his healing, rather than relieving him from the torment, God wanted him to experience

487
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:43,720
 a power that would only be understood if it was encountered in the torment.

488
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,700
 What God's doing here is He's doing something simply profound for Paul.

489
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:54,740
 In the area of his mental health struggles, He's leading Paul not to fight it, not to

490
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:03,640
 flee from it, and not to ignore it, but to face it, to accept it.

491
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,340
 Not accept it like, "Oh, this is fine.

492
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,340
 This is cool.

493
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,340
 Great.

494
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,020
 I'm going to be forever anxious or forever tormented," right?

495
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,700
 Not accept it like, "Oh, okay, fine.

496
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,700
 It doesn't matter.

497
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,900
 No big deal."

498
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:19,060
 Accept it in the sense of, "This is part of my journey right now, and it's okay to

499
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,300
 not be okay.

500
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:27,340
 It's okay to realize that I have something that's happening in my life that is overwhelming,

501
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,500
 but I am not alone.

502
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,300
 I'm not given up on.

503
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,660
 That God is going to meet me in this moment.

504
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,740
 That God's grace is sufficient."

505
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,860
 Sometimes the most powerful answer God can give you is not healing.

506
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,460
 Oh, let me preach on this one for a moment.

507
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,460
 Sometimes the most powerful answer is not your healing.

508
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:54,740
 God's greatest gift to Paul here and God's greatest gift to us is not our healing.

509
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,420
 It is always His grace.

510
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:03,260
 And His grace at times, and it's wonderful, does lead us into moments of incredible healing,

511
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:08,780
 and we celebrate it, but every single time, what that grace will do is lead you into an

512
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,420
 encounter of Christ's power, even when the healing is absent.

513
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,820
 That's His grace.

514
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,980
 His grace is the most important gift He will ever give you.

515
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:24,540
 And sometimes God doesn't give healing because He wants to give something more.

516
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:30,820
 He wants you to know His grace, and that His grace is sufficient for you.

517
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,420
 And maybe He'll heal you, and maybe He won't, but He will be there for you, and He'll lead

518
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:40,180
 you into a place where you can accept the reality that sometimes things are out of your

519
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,740
 control.

520
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:51,540
 And when things are out of your control, those are the moments when God can be most powerful.

521
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,460
 What God's doing here for Paul is He's helping him to understand, and I think it's something

522
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,060
 important for us.

523
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,340
 He's helping all of us to understand a journey that's important to go on, and that is to

524
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,780
 accept the reality that sometimes things are out of our control, and sometimes that's our

525
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,980
 thinking and our feeling.

526
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:13,700
 So often when we encounter mental health issues, when I first encountered my anxiety, my reaction

527
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:19,620
 was I need to control this thing, and I need to stop feeling this way.

528
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,660
 And over many years of therapy, God led me to a place where actually I was able to accept

529
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,160
 the reality of my anxiety.

530
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,180
 Not accept it from like, "I'm just going to give up."

531
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:34,660
 I continue today to stand with it, to fight with it, to pray to God about it, but I continue

532
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,500
 to understand that it is not the sum total of who I am.

533
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,940
 I continue to understand that it might be a co-passenger on my bus, but it will not

534
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,940
 drive my bus.

535
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,060
 That the only person who ever drives my bus is Christ, and His grace is sufficient.

536
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:59,100
 Even if anxiety is on my bus for the rest of my life, His grace is sufficient for me.

537
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,500
 What Paul was able to do here…

538
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,860
 Can I go another five, ten minutes?

539
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,860
 Is that all right?

540
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,740
 Is this okay for everybody, leaning into this?

541
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:13,420
 What Paul does here is rather than fight his torment, rather than flee from it, he actually

542
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:19,300
 finds himself in a place where he can accept it so that it creates space in him to actually

543
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,060
 take a different perspective to the torment itself.

544
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,940
 Where before he was trying to fight that torment, when before his attitude was, "I need to

545
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,820
 get rid of this thing," he then comes to a position where he can change his relationship

546
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:41,860
 to his suffering, and go from an attack and a kind of "get it out of me" to a trust

547
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:48,460
 in God's grace and a distance from it that will eventually enable it to be released.

548
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,420
 This is a beautiful thing.

549
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:55,980
 God's like, "This journey that I want to lead you on, it's the journey that will truly

550
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
 set you free.

551
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,260
 Sure, I could heal you in an instant, and I could take the pain away immediately, but

552
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,300
 the next time the anxiety comes, you're going to be in the same place of torment.

553
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,020
 But if I can lead you to a place where you'll understand that my grace is sufficient for

554
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,620
 you, if I can lead you in a place where you can open your heart and say, 'You know what?

555
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,780
 Sometimes this is just a part of who I am.

556
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,780
 I don't understand it.

557
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,340
 I don't always like it, but it is who I am in some times of my life, and yet here now

558
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,820
 is an opportunity to lean in again to the grace of God, lean in again to the power of

559
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:32,220
 Christ, and God will never let me down, never let me down here, even if I still continue

560
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,220
 to feel anxious."

561
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,580
 There's another person in Scripture that felt this way, and I want to take you here as we

562
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,580
 close.

563
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,340
 This is from Matthew chapter 26.

564
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,740
 This person has the name Jesus.

565
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,300
 Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit

566
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,980
 here while I go over there and pray."

567
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,740
 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him and began to be sorrowful and

568
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,740
 troubled.

569
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,740
 I want you to see this.

570
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,700
 Jesus also struggled with mental and emotional anguish.

571
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:06,500
 Verse 38, "And then he said to them, 'My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of

572
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
 death.'"

573
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,260
 This is how hard this is for Jesus.

574
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,740
 He literally wants to die.

575
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,700
 He's so overwhelmed and tormented that he wants to die.

576
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,200
 He says, "Stay here.

577
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
 Keep watch with me."

578
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,540
 "Going a little farther, he fell face to the ground and prayed, 'My Father, if it's possible

579
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:28,180
 for me, may this cup be taken from me, yet not as I will, but as you will.'

580
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,860
 Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping."

581
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,660
 Oh my goodness.

582
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,220
 This is like sometimes when I look up from preaching and I find you sleeping.

583
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,060
 It's not good.

584
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:42,340
 It's not good, people.

585
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,380
 I'm much nicer to you than Jesus is to the disciples.

586
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,380
 Look what he says here.

587
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,360
 He says, "Could you men not keep watch with me?"

588
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
 For what?

589
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,360
 Can you not stay awake for 25 minutes?

590
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,360
 Okay, it's 40 minutes, but whatever.

591
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
 All right.

592
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,520
 He asked Peter, "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation, for the Spirit

593
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,360
 is willing and the body is weak."

594
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,800
 He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup

595
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,240
 to be taken away, unless I drink it, then your will be done."

596
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,000
 When he came back, he again found them sleeping because their eyes were heavy.

597
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,920
 So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.

598
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,040
 Three times God goes before God, like Paul, and says, "Would you remove this from me?

599
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,440
 If there's any other way, if it's not the cross, I'd be super happy.

600
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,960
 If you can lead me in any other direction, God, and I can do this salvation thing any

601
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,520
 other way, that's what I want, but not my will.

602
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
 Your will be done."

603
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,200
 In other words, may it be to me whatever it is that you want to be to me, but this is

604
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,320
 hurting, this is anguish, this is difficult.

605
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,240
 But three times God doesn't give them any other way.

606
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,360
 So at the end of the third time, he submits himself to the will of God.

607
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,720
 He's arrested, he's beaten, "kososfixo," smashed up.

608
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:58,520
 And then, notice this, the greatest pain and humiliation then came.

609
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,560
 His accusers put a crown of thorns on his head.

610
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,320
 Ooh, thorns.

611
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,800
 So I wonder when Paul later on talked about thorns, I wonder whether he was trying to

612
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,680
 get the church to think about this moment.

613
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,560
 The thorns were placed on Jesus, and the thorns cut his head.

614
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,200
 And if you've ever had a head wound, you'll know that head wounds bleed a lot.

615
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,080
 So here's the crazy thing.

616
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:31,080
 The crown of thorns that Jesus' accusers put on his head to hurt and humiliate him became

617
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:39,560
 the very thing that caused the blood to flow on the cross that would bring him glory.

618
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,440
 Come on church, that's deep, I know, but take that in.

619
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:49,800
 The very thing that the enemy had designed, the thorn, to create the pain, actually was

620
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,520
 the very thing that shed the blood that would be the very thing that would bring glory.

621
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,280
 You see, the thorn brought the blood that would bring the glory.

622
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,280
 And it will be the same in your life as well.

623
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,360
 The thorns in our flesh that God gives us grace to walk in will be the very things that

624
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:15,040
 will pour the blood of Jesus upon us and show us his glory like never before.

625
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:25,320
 It's the thorns that bring the blood that even when we're weak, he is strong.

626
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
 Can I pray for you?

627
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:35,680
 I wonder if you'd stand with me and I want to pray for you.

628
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,080
 I wonder whether you'd just open your hands with me.

629
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:44,760
 Father, just so grateful.

630
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:51,040
 Just let a moment, I sense the Lord wants to do some deep ministry for some of you here

631
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,600
 now.

632
00:39:52,600 --> 00:40:01,560
 Some of you have been carrying something for so long and the Holy Spirit is here now.

633
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:09,760
 Some of you have been fighting something for so long.

634
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,120
 Some of you have been ignoring something for so long.

635
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,200
 Some of you, like me, are afraid to talk to people about it because you think that they

636
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,400
 will see you weak.

637
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,280
 Some of you have been really frustrated because you've been praying and praying and praying

638
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,480
 and God hasn't taken it away.

639
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:40,520
 Maybe like Paul, God wants to redefine for some of us our relationship to our suffering

640
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,560
 because there is something of his glory that we could never see otherwise.

641
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,040
 Just take a moment now just to allow the Spirit of God to speak to you.

642
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:58,280
 He loves you so much.

643
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,720
 Disability is still an issue in my life, but I have come to such deep encounters of the

644
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:12,040
 grace of God that I never regret getting it.

645
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:21,360
 My prayer is that you would come to know a God whose grace is sufficient in whatever

646
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:28,440
 suffering he might be inviting you to carry.

647
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,960
 One of my favorite passages from Genesis is when Joseph is standing in front of his brothers

648
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,160
 who have sold him into slavery.

649
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,440
 I want to read this to you whilst your eyes are closed and your hands are open.

650
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
 He says this.

651
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:48,920
 He says, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for his good, to accomplish what

652
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,600
 is now being done, the saving of many lives.

653
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:01,640
 My anxiety intended to harm me, but God has intended it for good, so that I would come

654
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,480
 to know him in a way I couldn't otherwise."

655
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,640
 Father, we come against the enemy's strategies in this area of the church to stop us from

656
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:19,160
 talking about it, to make us boil it all down to one simple solution.

657
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:28,560
 Father, we come to you as a people of grace, as a people in need of grace, as a people

658
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,560
 in need of healing.

659
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,760
 And Lord, I believe that you will heal people in this room, that there'll be some people

660
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,120
 in this room that will be healed very quickly.

661
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,720
 And that's a wonderful work of your grace.

662
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,040
 And there'll be people in this room that will be called to carry what it is that they're

663
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,520
 carrying for many years.

664
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,920
 And that also is a wonderful work of your grace.

665
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:56,320
 Lord, I pray that we would find a God whose grace is sufficient.

666
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:03,360
 Take your time just to allow the Spirit to minister to you.

667
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,360
 Come Lord Jesus, come.

668
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,940
 (gentle music)

669
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,940
