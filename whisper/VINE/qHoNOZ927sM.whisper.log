[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   the sort of centrality of the gospel, a little bit about a model, practical,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   and then a little bit about one of the ways in which we're living this out here at the Vine.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.600]   Is that helpful for you? Can I pray for you to begin with?
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.960]   Father, I thank you for every person here. I thank you, Lord, for the work that you're doing in their
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.400]   lives. I thank you, Lord, that you are at work shaping and molding us to become more like Christ
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.000]   Jesus. Lord, as we take a look at why justice is so key to that growth within us to become more like
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.920]   you. Father, I pray that you would do something in this room a little bit like those disciples on the
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.520]   walk to Emmaus, who after hearing Jesus open scripture to them, had these words together.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.440]   They said, "Were not our hearts burning within us?" Lord, I want to pray for the Vine here, Lord,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.960]   that you would reignite for those where the light was there before, but maybe has gone a bit dark,
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.160]   and that you would birth fresh light for those who are perhaps hearing this for the first time.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.960]   That we would be ones whose hearts would burn within us for justice, burn within us for the
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.920]   gospel, burn within us because you, Jesus, opened the glorious picture of scripture to us. And we
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.760]   pray this in Jesus' name. Everyone says? All right. So now I'm going to have to ask for your forgiveness
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.200]   up front. I'm going to be using an iPad. I'm old now, so the technology I'm not always good with.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.760]   I also have a terrible way of writing. I should have been a doctor. Everybody knows that doctors
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.120]   have the worst handwriting ever. You can never read a prescription. Oh, that shouldn't be there.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.440]   How do I get a new page? We should have sorted that out. Hang on a sec. Let me do this.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.120]   Bye, bye, bye. Can't all see it. That was the first service. But you can see how messy it is, right?
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:57.920]   It's not on the screen yet? Oh, okay. All right. Well, the guys did a good job. Okay.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.200]   How do I now go away? This is why I told you I'm not very good. It's frozen. Okay.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.320]   Is it frozen? It's frozen.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:21.600]   Anyway, there it is. That's you in the middle there. And okay, it's just crashed. All right.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.360]   My friend, could you help me? All right. This is a young person. He's young and trendy and
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.600]   understands technology. And he's now going to solve the issue we have. Anyway, justice. So
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.160]   talk amongst yourselves. Say, what does justice mean to you?
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:48.080]   I'm not kidding, right? I don't actually mean this. This is quite fun though, because as we do
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.920]   unpack this, there's a lot in this. So I'm going to need your attention as we go through. And,
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.840]   you know, it's a beautiful thing when you let Scripture really drive your thinking and really
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.080]   drive the way that you see things. And I think when you see the bigger picture of Scripture,
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.880]   not just the immediacy of like one passage, but when you step back and see the bigger picture of
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.680]   it, it really does change a lot. It really does shift a lot in the way in which we think and act.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.000]   And so that's why I'm excited to be able to do that together. How are we doing?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.240]   Oh, you are amazing. Can we give that guy a round of applause?
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.880]   Okay. So we're going to start at the beginning of the story in a garden.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.200]   So the beginning of the biblical is that, hey, look at that. The beginning of the biblical story
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.320]   is Genesis 1 and 2, this idea of the garden. Now we know that in Genesis 1 and 2, God does so much
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.400]   to establish his heart for the world, to establish what he wants in creation. He creates literally
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.720]   within those chapters. And at the pinnacle of his creation, which is important for us,
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.600]   is this idea of humanity. Right? So there is this humanity that he creates, and he says that we are
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.240]   made in this really important thing, in the image of God. Now, scholars have debated for years what
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.320]   this image of God means, but to summarize it for you, it's essentially about relationship and
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.840]   character. Being made as humans in the image of God means that we are in relationship with him,
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.360]   I mean that we find our fullness in that relationship with him. And we image, we mirror,
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.240]   we reflect something of his character, his nature, his integrity, and who he is to the world around
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.000]   us. And what you see in Genesis 1 and 2 is the outworking of this image. And I'll unpack that
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.080]   for you a little bit here as we go. But for now, it's important that your very creation as a human
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.760]   being is this invitation to image God. And we are the only things in creation that are labeled as
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.400]   his image. Now, what you see in Genesis 1 and 2 is God do this really interesting thing. God comes
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:57.440]   and he defines for humanity what is right and wrong. So, one of the very first things that he
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.840]   does in Genesis 1 and 2, when he's created Adam, and he speaks to Adam, and creates Eve, and brings
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.000]   them together, is he begins to define for them what is right and wrong. How God defines it,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.160]   how God sees it in the world that he's created. And he gives them some freedom. He says, "You can
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.600]   do this, you can do that, you can do this." And then he gives them some boundaries. He says not
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.000]   to do this, not to do that. This is God's way of saying, "Look, there's right and there's wrong
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.640]   within this world that you are living in right now. And if you understand that, and you live by
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.560]   my definitions of what right is wrong, then things will grow and flourish." So, what he does after he
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.600]   calls them, after he defines what is right and wrong, he calls them to do this really important
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.360]   thing. He wants them to rule over creation. So, in other words, he says, "Look, I haven't just
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.400]   created you to do whatever you want. I've defined for you what is right and wrong. I've created you
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.120]   to be in my image, and part of you imaging me is to rule over creation." Now, you remember in the
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.040]   Holy Spirit course, the idea of disorder to order. God does this crazy thing in Genesis 1 and 2. He
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.000]   actually empowers humanity to mirror, to image that work in how we now steward the creation.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.960]   Steward everything that he's placed around us, and all of those relationships. We now get the
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.680]   great opportunity to show the world the disorder to order by how we now live. Are you following this
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.960]   so far? So, you are made in the image of God. God has defined for us what is right and wrong,
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:28.720]   and we are invited to rule over creation in that way. Now, here's what happens next. As we're ruling
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:38.000]   over creation, God establishes what we call here four relational contexts. Now, these four relational
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.680]   contexts are essential to every human being, and let me map them out for you. We don't have time to
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.240]   go into the Scriptures to look at them, but they're there. You can look during the week. Us and God,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:58.560]   us and ourselves, so how we see ourselves, our identity, us and others around us, and finally,
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:06.080]   us in creation. So, God creates us and gives us these four relational contexts, our relationship
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.480]   with Him, our relationship with ourselves, how we see ourselves, our relationship with the others
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.800]   around us, and the relationship with the creation. And He does that, and He brings us into that,
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.080]   and He says, "As you're my image, bringing disorder to order, you're going to look after,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.200]   you're going to steward this creation you're giving under my definition of what is right and wrong."
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.280]   And at the end of Genesis 1 and 2, you see this picture, which the Bible describes as perfect
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.120]   shalom, or what we often use here at the Vine, this phrase flourishing, but it's this idea,
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.720]   not that it's peace, like you're going to chill out with a pina colada on a beach,
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.240]   but the idea of wholeness and fullness and everything just as it's meant to be. So,
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.320]   by the time you get to the end of Genesis 1 and 2, you've got humanity, image of God,
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.040]   you've got God's definition of right and wrong, you've got us with a role to play in stewarding
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.640]   creation, and you've got these relational contexts at work in our lives, and God stands back from it
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:04.400]   all and says, "That is very good." Now, I want you to see something really important here in what
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.240]   I've just mapped out in Genesis 1 and 2. There is no concept at all of justice or injustice at the
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.760]   beginning of the story, because there's no need for it. There's no need for justice. The only
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.920]   reason you need justice is because there's injustice. Does that make sense? Well, there's
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:26.480]   no injustice in Genesis 1 and 2. This is the way God has created the world to be. This is His design,
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.040]   His desire for humanity to be, and when we are living in that way, things are just as they should
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:43.120]   be, and that is shalom. Make sense? However, we of course know what happens next, don't we? So,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:52.000]   as well as a garden, we know what happens next is there's a fall. So, where humanity and God are the
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.920]   primary characters within the first part of Genesis 1 and 2, as soon as we get into Genesis 3, a new
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.760]   character emerges, and this is Satan. And Satan comes and does something which you've got to make
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.120]   sure that you've track with when you're reading the story. Satan basically convinces Adam and Eve
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.040]   that God is holding out on them, that God is not telling them everything. When God put the boundary
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.640]   of not having fruit of the knowledge of the tree of good and evil, Satan comes along and says, "Well,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.480]   why doesn't he want you to eat from that tree? Here's why he doesn't want you to eat from that
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:29.920]   tree. If you eat from that tree, you'll no longer be the image of God. You'll be God's yourselves."
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:37.040]   So, Satan's trickery is to say, "Image of God is not what humanity has been created for.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:44.000]   You've actually been created to be God's yourselves." This was the temptation for Adam and Eve.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.480]   This was the sin that they stepped into. No longer that they were happy just to image the character
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.920]   and the integrity of God and allow God to be sovereign and control. The taking of the fruit,
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.520]   the sin that happened was humanity saying, "We want to do this ourselves.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:08.640]   We want to be God's. We want to be not just image of Him. We want to be Him." And what this does
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.200]   is really interesting because here's the first thing that takes place. Once humanity sin,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.320]   once they take that establishment of saying, "We want to be actually like God's." Here's what happens.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:28.800]   Humanity is now defining what's right and wrong. Now, this is where the problems all begin.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:35.520]   Think about it for a moment. Before God defined what was right and wrong, now humanity through
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.840]   sin are basically saying, "We are the ones that are going to define what's right and wrong. Here's
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.960]   what will happen to every human being if you ask them to define right and wrong. Here's the thing
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:52.560]   that will happen. We will always define it in a way that benefits us." And this is what we begin
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.400]   to see in the cycle of Scripture. Humanity basically, we are constantly redefining what
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:06.560]   is right and wrong so that we gain an advantage over the expense of the other. And this becomes
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:13.360]   the central place where injustice begins to happen in the world. If you give humanity the power to
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.560]   decide what they think is right and wrong, humanity is always going to choose what's great for
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:24.720]   themselves personally, even if that means it's not great for their neighbor next to them. This is why
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:31.680]   inequality exists. This is why not everybody is free. This is why there are people that are not
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.080]   just poor but are vulnerable and they are marginalized and they are exploited because
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.360]   we have a tendency now as human beings to look after number one, even if that means at the expense
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.600]   of somebody else. And what you see happening in Genesis 3 is immediately two things. Number one,
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:56.240]   you immediately see personal advantage. So Adam and Eve immediately want to find their own personal
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.960]   advantage, even if that comes at the expense of the other. And number two, you see this thing
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:09.920]   called self-preservation. What's the very first thing that happens when Adam takes the fruit
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.040]   sins, God shows up and says, "What have you done?" Here's what Adam does. He goes, "God, come here."
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:21.840]   He goes, "God, you need to hear this. The woman that you put in here with me, she made me do this."
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.280]   That's the first thing that Adam does. He basically throws his wife under the bus. The first marital
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.800]   strife ever happens here. He throws his wife under the bus and he says, "The woman you put here with
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:38.240]   me." So he's kind of blaming God too. Think about this. This is really important. The very first
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:45.600]   act of injustice in all human history is the disempowerment of a woman for the empowerment
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:53.120]   of a man. All the sisters in the room should be going, "Mm-hmm." You should be like, "Preach on that.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:59.200]   Preach that one, Andrew." But are you following this? Now, this is really important because if
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.920]   that's the first injustice that has ever happened, the disempowerment of a woman for the empowerment
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:09.840]   of a man because look at it here. There's personal advantage and self-preservation. Basically, Adam
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.320]   was willing to throw his wife under the bus so that he could live, thinking that that might be the way
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:20.000]   to get back into God's good graces. Suddenly, injustice begins. And that injustice of men
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.440]   exploiting women has happened down all of history ever since. And let's be honest, it's still rife
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:32.000]   in our world today. That's the starting point of injustice. As soon as humanity begins to take into
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.760]   their power what is only God's power and they begin to redefine what is right and wrong, we begin to
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:45.040]   look after ourselves first of all, and then we begin to exploit the people around us. Now, here's what
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.160]   happens after all that takes place. Once there's this personal advantage, once there's this kind of
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:56.800]   self-preservation, it actually leads us into a place where what you see is injustice begin.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:05.840]   And as injustice begins, everything begins to break down. And what you see here is... Can you
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:13.760]   see this little pie chart? Yeah, it's still there. That's cool. So one, two, three, four. Those four
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.680]   relational contexts that were established in Genesis 1 and 2. This is really important.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.720]   As soon as humanity starts to redefine right and wrong, as soon as they look after themselves at
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:28.480]   the expense of others, here's what takes place. Over time, all four of those relational contexts
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.640]   immediately break down. Suddenly, there is a breakdown in their relationship with God. They
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.120]   hide from Him in the garden. There's a breakdown in their relationship with themselves. They suddenly
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.160]   feel shame for what they've done. They realize they're naked, right? And they become shamed.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   There's suddenly a breakdown in their relationship with one another. Adam throwing Eve under the bus.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.000]   And there's suddenly a breakdown in their relationship with creation. Now creation is
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.440]   going to cause pain for them when before creation and them were in perfect harmony together. So all
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:02.080]   four of those relationships are suddenly smeared with injustice. And the great question from this
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:09.920]   point in the story forward is, "How do we fix this?" Like this world is now a far away way. This is just
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.560]   the first three chapters of Scripture, by the way. But now the world is so far away from what it was
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:21.360]   originally created to be. Now, the good thing is that we have a God who responds. So what happens
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:30.720]   next in the story where there's been a fall, there is now a call. God responds. And here's how God
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:37.360]   responds. He actually calls a new family. He calls Abraham and his family. And He says to Abraham and
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.760]   his family, "Leave the place that you're in right now, this place that is filled with all of this
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.560]   pain and all this injustice." He said, "I'm going to move you into a new land. And in that new land,
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.840]   we're going to start again. And there's going to be a generation, a nation, the nation of Israel,
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:58.240]   ultimately, that will flow out from you, that will begin to model to the world again what this
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.560]   justice might look like." It's really interesting. Injustice happens by one biological family.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:11.680]   God begins the story of justice from another one biological family. Takes Abraham with his wife
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:17.200]   and with everything they had, and they move outwards into the new. And then from this point
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:24.720]   forward in Scripture, from Genesis 4, basically Genesis 4 onwards, God defines this Israel.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.920]   He defines this group of people with three things, two positive, one negative. Let me show you this.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.080]   This is really important. And this gets repeated in Scripture all the time. The first thing is,
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:40.720]   He says, "I call you to righteousness." This in the Hebrew is the word tzedakah.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:47.440]   And tzedakah is a very important word. When we think of righteousness normally in the English
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.480]   language, here's what we think. We think about our moral behavior. So we think, "If I'm righteous,
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.560]   or if I'm a righteous person, it's because I have good moral behavior or good standing,
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.520]   or I'm a good person and I do good things." The Hebrew concept of righteousness, tzedakah,
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:07.120]   is actually not about individual morality or individual ethics. It's much more about the
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.440]   communal environment and the communal ethics. So when the Lord says, "You will be my righteous
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.360]   people," He's not just saying individually you're going to be really good people. He's saying,
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.840]   "As a community together, as a nation together, as a group of people together, you're going to
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:26.960]   begin to image me again. You're going to go back to what it is that I've called you to go."
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:32.160]   If you look at the breakdown so far, I'm going to take you back where I will define for you what
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.840]   is right and wrong. This will be the law that is given in Mount Sinai and everything like that.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.480]   I'm going to empower you again to rule over creation. You're going to be restored in these
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.480]   relationships, and you're going to show the world. That's righteousness, a communal ability.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:56.880]   So righteousness has this idea of community and is other focused. Why is that important? Because
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:03.680]   the breakdown is in personal self-focus. The righteousness is in other focus. Now the second
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:10.160]   word that is equally important is, of course, the word that we translate as justice. In the Hebrew,
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:18.400]   it's "mishpah." And "mishpah" means both retributive, which I'll explain in a second,
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:24.560]   and restorative. Both of the elements of retributive justice and restorative justice
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:31.520]   are included in this phrase "mishpah." Now, retributive justice, we're aware of that.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:37.360]   That's the issue. I steal something. I get caught. I've got to pay it back. Or I'm penalized in some
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.320]   way. I have to pay for the crime that I've committed. So mishpah has this element of
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.360]   retributive justice. But the bigger picture is restorative justice. And restorative justice,
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.560]   again, focus on the community and focus on not just individual people doing certain things,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:58.880]   but how do we as a community now live where there are no poor amongst us, where there is no
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.160]   inequality, where people who are slaves are set free, where those that need freedom are given it?
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.320]   What does it look like to structure society together under God's definitions of right or wrong,
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:16.960]   not ours, where we shift from being self-focused to other-focused? And how do we now live like that?
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:24.000]   Justice has communal impact. Does that make sense? It changes the way in which not just we live,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.240]   but how people live amongst us. Now, interestingly, there's a third word that is really also repeated
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:38.160]   this time. In English, we translate it to be the word "wicked." But in Hebrew, it's the word "rashab."
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:44.960]   You have to roll your "r" there. But "rashab" literally means the opposite of everything else
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:51.920]   that we just talked about. Rashab, the wicked, are the ones who stay in the Genesis 3 perspective.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:58.960]   Personal advantage, self-preservation, doing what I want to do, even if it means hurting or exploiting
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.080]   or doing something. That doesn't matter. I'm looking after number one here, and it doesn't
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.400]   matter if it impacts everybody else. This, the Bible, from Genesis 4 onwards, when it uses the
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.160]   phrase in the Old Testament, "wicked," it's talking about these who don't have righteousness and don't
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:20.800]   have justice. They are wicked. If I was to explain it in a very clear way, listen to it this way.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:29.680]   The wicked are those who are willing to basically disadvantage the community for their advantage.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:35.440]   The righteous are the ones who are willing to disadvantage themselves for the advantage of
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.160]   the community. You follow that? So the wicked want to basically disadvantage the community so that
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.120]   they can succeed. The righteous are willing to lay down their lives. What does that remind you of?
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:51.520]   They're willing to sacrifice so that those around them might be able to gain. This is the tension
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:57.600]   that Scripture brings us to, and this is the beginning of the process of God saying, "I want
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:04.640]   justice to come into the world." So where before in Genesis 4, we begin to see what injustice looks
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:11.440]   like in this call of Israel and Abraham, we begin to see God's model for justice. Now, let me take
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:17.120]   this to the next step. Everybody still okay? Still tracking with me? Interesting enough. Are your
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:23.520]   hearts burning within you yet? Okay, I need to do more. Okay. The next thing that happens is we get
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:29.760]   a model of what this begins to look like. The Exodus is the next story in the Scriptures after
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.960]   we get to the end of Genesis, the next book, Exodus. And this is God modeling what all of this
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:41.760]   justice looks like. Because in Exodus, his people have now become oppressed,
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:49.600]   and they are now slaves. So his people are not living through both their own fault but not their
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.320]   fault. They're not now living in the way that God wants them to be. They're an oppressed people.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:00.560]   They're slaves. And what we learn at the beginning of Exodus is that God has compassion. This moves
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.440]   the heart of God, Exodus chapter 2. God's heart is moved within him. He sees his people under
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.160]   oppression and slavery. He hears their cries, just like that song that we just sang, "I sought the
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:17.120]   Lord. He listened. He answered." He hears their cries, and he moves with compassion to do three
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.040]   things. These are the three things that God does in Exodus. Number one, he brings his presence
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.640]   again to his people. God is like, "You need to know that I am with you. You need to know that I am
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.240]   with you in your pain, with you in your oppression, with you in the reality of what it is that you're
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.920]   going through." The God that we serve is not a God who directs justice from a white fluffy cloud up
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:46.640]   on the sky. The God that we serve as Christians is a God who comes to be present in the injustices
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:52.160]   that he sees in his world. So he's present with us. Number two, he then is an advocate.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:59.760]   God raises up Moses. He raises up Aaron. He raises up her, and he calls them to be advocates on
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.720]   behalf of justice in the world. They go to Pharaoh, don't they? And they say, "Let my people go.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:10.640]   You're enslaving my people. This is not right." They stand in the corridors of power, and they fight
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.480]   on behalf of those that are oppressed. And the third thing God does in this model of what justice
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:22.160]   looks like is, of course, he then moves into action. He then actually begins to change things.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:28.320]   He actually brings the plagues that cause Pharaoh to let his people go. He parts the sea so they can
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.600]   get through, and then he brings the waters back onto the Egyptian army. He provides for the manor
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:40.160]   in the wilderness. He provides for them a new promise land. So God acts in justice after having
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.400]   compassion, making himself present, being an advocate, and then acting on people's behalf.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.200]   Is this all making sense? So this is a beautiful model that we see in Exodus, and this leads us to
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:58.960]   this beautiful idea of the prophets. So beyond the Exodus story become the prophets, and the prophets
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:05.280]   take this model of Exodus and begin to speak it over the years of Israel from that point forward.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.120]   Often when we think of the prophets, we think the prophets are prophets of doom. We think the
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.560]   prophets are all like, "Oh my God, they're like the ones that you want to avoid at all costs."
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.160]   You know, like they're the ones where you can't even read those books without falling asleep.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.400]   They're the ones where, you know, the prophets are all negative. It's all about sin. It's all about
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.600]   brokenness. It's all about how God is so angry at people. Don't think of the prophets that way.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.640]   Think of the prophets instead in the lens of justice. The prophets are the advocating mouthpiece
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.920]   of God for the things that God defines as right and wrong. So the prophets come. They're not
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.960]   prophets of doom. They're prophets of hope. They show up to Israel and they say, "Look, you're
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.080]   living this way. You're acting this way. That's wrong, and it's wrong because God has already
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:51.120]   declared and established the right ways of thinking. His righteousness and his justice are here, but
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.320]   you're living like rashab, like wickedness, but you have a chance to change," the prophets say.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:02.640]   "You've got a window to be new, a window to act and live and be differently." The prophets were always
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.160]   offering God's people the opportunity for them to return to the ways in which God has called them to
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:13.680]   be. The prophets were basically reminding the people about their humanity, about how they are
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.560]   the image of God in the world, and how they've gotten so far away from that because now they're
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.000]   in charge of right and wrong. They're the ones that are looking after themselves. They're the
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.440]   ones that are causing the expense and the pain and the exploitation of others, and the prophets say,
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:36.160]   "That's not the way you were created to be. There is another story." Prophets of hope, not prophets
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:47.440]   of doom. But as we continue our journey, can you still see it all? There's a problem, and here's the
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:55.360]   problem. Even after God sets his people free from their slavery in Egypt and established them in
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.800]   their own land, and says to them, "Now is the chance for you to live as you were always created to be,"
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:15.040]   something happens. Basically, the oppressed now become... What do they become? The oppressors.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:21.280]   This should fascinate us because this is a picture of human behavior. There were actually more
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:27.200]   slaves in Israel in the time of David and Solomon than there were ever Jewish slaves in Egypt.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   So despite the fact that they had experienced a history, 400 years of their own brokenness
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.000]   and their own slavery, when they were finally set free, guess what they did? They enslaved others.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.200]   The oppressed were set free, and they became the oppressor. I tell you what, this is played out
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:51.040]   on global politics around the world all the time. One party gets in, and suddenly it's like, "Let's
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:56.560]   give pain to that other party for however many years." Or suddenly a new tribe is established,
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.760]   and that tribe is like, "Now it's our turn to eat, and everybody else can suffer."
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.400]   It's funny how the oppressed, when they are given freedom, so often then become the oppressor.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.720]   And what you see in the Old Testament is that there's a problem. And the problem is they begin
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:14.640]   to realize that there are some systemic issues in humanity and in the world that are not fixed by
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:21.120]   just trying to be nicer people. That there's something far deeper at work than just trying
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:27.040]   to be better, trying to be more just. No, there's something broken within us as human beings that
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:33.040]   no matter how hard we try to fix it, we cannot fix it. And because it's systemic, what you see
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:40.640]   in Scripture is a cycle of injustice. And by the time you get to the end of the Old Testament,
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.240]   here's what God's people are saying. They're saying, "We can't fix this thing.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.680]   We've tried really hard to live like we're supposed to live. We tried really hard, but
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.000]   there's something so much within us that if I just get one ounce of freedom, I'm going to start
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.120]   looking after me, even if that means other people are going to suffer." You following this?
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.560]   So by the end of the Old Testament, here's what the people of God are saying. They're saying,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:10.080]   "God has to do this. We can't fix this problem, but only God might." And they begin to wonder,
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:16.560]   "Is God going to act again in the future and make everything right?" I love this quote from
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.960]   Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a very famous quote, but I want to say it in the context of everything I've
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:26.000]   been mapping out for you. Dietrich Bonhoeffer says this, "We are not to simply bandage the
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.680]   wounds of victims beneath the wheels of injustice. We are to drive a spoke into the wheel itself."
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.240]   And by the time you get to the end of the Old Testament, that's essentially what the people
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.840]   of God are saying. They're like, "We're the wheel of injustice, so therefore we can't be the spoke.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:49.280]   We're the wheel itself. We need God to be the spoke. We need the spoke to come, to break open,
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:55.120]   and to stop the outworking and the ongoing work of injustice in us." And God's people are crying
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:01.280]   to God for the spoke. And then there's some 400 years of silence. So those of you who are in
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.960]   waiting period right now know that sometimes the Lord moves and acts in the times of waiting.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:14.800]   But then finally, oh, I can't even spell Jesus. Lord Jesus, forgive me. I do love you.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:25.840]   God brings the spoke. Jesus comes. And the important thing about Jesus,
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.240]   how's this going? Can you see it? I'm getting bigger as I go. That's weird.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.640]   There's this incarnation. So Jesus comes. And what is the incarnation?
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:42.800]   He is, this is very important, He is fully God. But what is He also? Fully human. Now, why does
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.360]   Jesus need to be fully God and fully human in this area of injustice? Think about it. The wheel
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:55.440]   is humanity. The spoke needs to be God. So Jesus is the only one who can actually step into the
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.240]   reality of this context and actually fix it. The Exodus was not. Even though the Exodus was God
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:06.480]   taking slaves into freedom, the Exodus didn't deal with the systemic issues. Jesus as the incarnation,
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:12.640]   fully God, fully human, is both the spoke and the wheel. And He can change it all. Now, notice how
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:18.560]   He changes it. It's very interesting. You follow the life of Jesus. Number one, the incarnation
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:25.600]   is this idea of His presence. Jesus with us in all of our brokenness. Number two, it's the idea of
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.880]   advocacy. This is what Jesus does, doesn't He? He stands on behalf of the vulnerable and marginalized.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.280]   He heals the crippled hand, the man of the crippled hand. On the Sabbath, when everybody else was like,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.240]   "You can't do that." Jesus is like, "You need to redefine what's right and wrong." He then takes
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.280]   that woman who's about to be stoned in slavery and He stands, a stone for her adultery, and He stands
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:51.200]   in the way. He fights on her behalf. There's many examples of Jesus doing advocacy. And then number
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:58.000]   three, He also does this. He also then moves into action. And He does that through so many healings,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.640]   so many things that He does to set people free. But the biggest piece of action that He does is what?
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:11.680]   It's the cross. And the cross becomes the place where Jesus drives a spoke into the wheel.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:18.160]   Now, the cross, it's really interesting. If I was to ask you here this morning, if I was to say,
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   "How do we describe the gospel? How do we come to understand the gospel?" Here's what I think
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:27.280]   so often we would say. We would say, "Well, the gospel is this. I'm a sinner and I'm in need of a Savior.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.560]   I'm broken within myself and my relationship with God is broken because of my sin. But Jesus came
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:38.000]   to this world to die on the cross to forgive me of my sin. And He was raised from death to life,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.920]   showing that sin has been defeated. So if I put my trust now in Jesus, I know that my grace has
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:49.280]   changed, that I am removed, and that my sin is dealt with, and that I now have eternal life with Him."
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:55.440]   So when we think about the gospel, we primarily talk about it in terms of the reconciliation
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:02.880]   of the first of those four relational contexts, us and God. And here's the problem. So many churches
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:10.560]   only define the gospel in that way. But I want you to think about this. If the gospel is only defined
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:18.080]   by us and God, but at the beginning of all things, it wasn't just us and God that got broken by sin,
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:23.520]   but also us and ourselves, us and others, and us and creation. But our gospel is only big enough
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.960]   to handle the reconciliation between us and God. I want to put it to you that that's not a gospel
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:36.560]   that's big enough. If your gospel only ever reconciles one of the elements of the four
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:42.480]   broken contexts, then it is not a gospel that brings shalom. And if it's not a gospel that
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.520]   restores shalom, it is not a gospel that you should believe in. It is not a gospel that is just.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:57.440]   The whole gospel is that what Jesus does on His cross doesn't just reconcile us to Him,
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.320]   but it reconciles all of those broken contexts. So let's go back to this moment
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:11.280]   of the cross. Let me show this to you. So we have things like 2 Corinthians 5.18. You can look at
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.440]   these later, but maybe just make a note of them for now. 2 Corinthians 5.18 says what Jesus has
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.840]   done on the cross is He's reconciled us back into relationship with God, solving that first broken
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:27.760]   context. Then you can read later in Galatians 4 verse 7, it says, "We were once slaves, but now we
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:33.040]   are children of God." In other words, restoring because of the cross, the brokenness within
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:39.200]   ourselves, the way that we see ourselves as slaves and not as His children. And then in Colossians
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:47.840]   3 verse 15, it says, "Now we are one body together, and there is peace amongst us," it says.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.640]   In other words, there's a reconciliation because of the cross that happens in our relationships
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:59.680]   together. And then finally, if you look at Romans 8 and you look at verses 19 to 22, it says, "All
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:05.760]   of creation was groaning for a long time, but now even creation has got its reconciliation with God
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.800]   because of the work of Jesus on the cross." So here's what I want you to do. I want you to take
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.920]   a photo of that. Can you take a photo of that? Does that? Yes. Now I know you're gonna have to
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.160]   zoom in because I got bigger and bigger and bigger as I went. I don't know why. But if you take a
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:26.400]   photo of that, I'll kind of get out of your way. That is the whole gospel. Does that make sense?
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:31.040]   And I want you to show, now that you're taking a photo of it, now I can mess it up. But watch this.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:37.760]   So 2 Corinthians 5 verse 18, that restores what was broken between us and God. Galatians 4 verse 7
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.080]   talks about the cross restoring our relationship with ourselves. Colossians 3 verse 15 about
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:48.560]   restoring what was broken with us. Romans 8, 19, 22, restoring what is broken in creation. That is
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:54.640]   the gospel to believe in. And if we believe in that gospel, that means that we are a people of justice.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:01.280]   Because if those four broken relational contexts is what has moved us into justice, the restoration
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:07.360]   of those things is what restores the world back to the way that it was supposed to be. The reason
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:13.760]   why Christians should be justice-centered and have a passion for justice is not to be driven
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.760]   because it's some good moral behavior. We are to be driven because it's the gospel.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:23.680]   Because it's the way in which Jesus has gone to the cross to pay the price, not just so that my
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:28.320]   relationship with him is restored, so that everything that was broken is restored. And if
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:35.760]   I'm on behalf of that, then I need to be just. It impacts the way I think about my relationship with
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.480]   him, how I think about myself, how I think about others, and whether I recycle or whether I care
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:46.160]   for creation or I look after the environment. All of these things matter because our original call
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:53.920]   as humans is to steward creation and to bring it into a place of shalom. So let me close by saying
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:59.520]   it like this. The reason why we call ourselves here at the Vine to justice is not because we're
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:06.240]   wanting you to be better acting people. It's because we want you to be actually human. We
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:13.600]   want you to be the way that you were originally created to be. And Jesus has made the way. He has
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:23.200]   driven the spoke into the wheel, and our great joy and privilege is to now live on that story.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:29.360]   That's why we're passionate about justice here. It flows from the Scriptures in such a profound
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.880]   way. And that is why we're going to call you over these three weeks into a relationship with Jesus
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:42.000]   that begins to outwork that passion. What he has done on the cross, fully seen in our church,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.360]   in our relationships, in our businesses, in our city, in society, in all of the world.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:54.400]   We want to live on behalf of that. Amen. Was that helpful? That's a theology of justice.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.360]   I know it's a lot. I know it's been long, but hopefully your heart might be somewhat burning
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:04.480]   within you to want to live on that and behalf of that in all the things that you do. Could you
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:13.360]   stand with me? And I'd love to pray with you. Father, we are so grateful for today. So grateful
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:20.400]   for this moment together. And so grateful for the work of justice that your son Jesus did.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:28.640]   Father, we want to pray that as you meet with us now, that for each person in this room,
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:34.000]   we're just grateful that you're making them more just. That they as a Christian are called to
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.080]   be biased towards the poor, the vulnerable, the marginalized, those enslaved, those exploited.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:48.480]   And Lord, forgive us where we all can recognize the tendency in our own lives towards personal
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:55.040]   advantage and self-preservation at the expense of the other. Maybe just take a moment just to
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:02.880]   be honest with the Lord. Every single one of us, that's almost the default as humans,
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:11.520]   as we wrestle with sin, is our own personal advantage, self-preservation at the expense
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.280]   of the other. And maybe you can just bring that to the Lord and say, "Lord, would you just forgive me?
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.280]   Lord, I don't want to live like that. I'm someone who carries the name of Christ.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:29.520]   You've saved me for a different way of living." Our starting point, Lord, is just to come before
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:35.200]   you and ask for your forgiveness. Lord, I believe that you're going to be lighting fires in this
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.240]   series and people in this room, those online, those in our overflow. Lord, it begins from just
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.920]   that place of humility to say, "Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus, for saving us from ourselves.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:50.400]   Thank you, Jesus, for saving me from wanting to redefine what is right and wrong so that I get an
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:56.960]   advantage or my people get an advantage at the expense of others." That's where racism comes from.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:05.760]   Lord, we call out the injustices we see in our world, and we call out the injustices we see in
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:12.400]   ourselves, and we ask ourselves, we ask you, Lord, that your gospel would be glorified,
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:19.520]   that the whole gospel would be seen, a reconciliation, us with you, us with ourselves,
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:25.600]   us with others, and us with creation. Lord, I pray that you would release people in this room
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.720]   into a journey that is ahead of them of becoming more like you,
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.240]   and in becoming more like you, becoming more just.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:45.040]   Lord, may we hold the whole gospel in our hearts, and we come against every pretense to a different
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:50.720]   version of the gospel, and we thank you that you have in your scriptures shown us a new way,
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:58.640]   the glorious way, the right way. Would righteousness and justice flow like a river
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:05.280]   here at the vine and in our city, and we pray this in Jesus' name. Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
