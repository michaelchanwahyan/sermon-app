[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   So, I have been to church for a long time, since I was really young.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.560]   And because of that, a lot of the aunties and uncles in the church would ask me, "Jun,
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.540]   go and share your testimony with the younger ones."
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.920]   And every time I hear that, I get really nervous.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.120]   Because I don't have a really good story to tell.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.880]   I'm a second generation Christian.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.520]   Well, actually a third, because my grandma was a Christian.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.000]   So I've always grown up knowing God is real.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.400]   I've always known, you know, He is here in my life.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.640]   So I don't have any exciting things to tell.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.440]   And also, when I want to talk about...
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.440]   Away.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.440]   So, exactly.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:46.240]   Like, sometimes I get really nervous about talking to people and sharing about my story,
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.480]   and there's just not much to say, right?
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.480]   Maybe you need to help me fix it.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.760]   Thank you so much.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.440]   So I have nothing, really a lot going on in my life to share.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.960]   Until, until my mom started baking bread.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.160]   Right?
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.280]   So she doesn't just bake her bread in those baking bread machines.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.880]   She would grow her yeast.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.280]   She would knead her bread by hand, and then she would prove it for a really long time.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.160]   She normally started it in the afternoon, and normally it takes the whole day to do
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.160]   it.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.920]   And so by night time, at 11 o'clock, night time, the whole house is filled with the bread
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.920]   aromas.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.800]   And she'd go, "Joon, would you like to taste my bread?"
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.640]   And I go, "Mom, I'm full already.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.160]   I just had dinner not too long ago."
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.320]   And she would be a little bit upset.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.400]   And she'd go, "Not even a bite of your mom's bread?"
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.080]   I go, "Okay, okay, let me taste it."
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.720]   So I would taste it.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.320]   And she would ask me, "Is it good?"
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.920]   "Yeah, it's good."
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.920]   And she would always have this follow up question to ask me, "Why is it good?
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.120]   Why do you like it?
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.240]   How do you compare it with store-bought bread?"
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.840]   And so now, as I'm like a few years later, I'm very good at describing the textures and
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.120]   the taste and all the different combinations of bread.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   And then I thought, "Wow, not only I'm able to articulate it.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.320]   What I say can be a proof for my mom to say that, 'Yes, my bread is good because my daughter
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.800]   said this, because this is exactly what she tasted.'"
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.440]   And so fast forward to now, when I realized that, oh, when I have to articulate why something
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.120]   is good, I can remember the details that I easily forgotten.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.920]   I could put the fleeting feelings into words to share with other people.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.960]   And testimony sharing is similar to that.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.160]   It is about sharing and celebrating what God has done in your life, whether it is when
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.720]   you first believe or when you're just experiencing God's presence in your life and the changes
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.000]   that he has in your life.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.080]   So stepping into 2025, think about 2024.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.560]   Has it been a really quick year for you?
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.040]   Or has this year been a little bit long and dragging and you're wishing that 2025 could
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.080]   come sooner?
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   Have you noticed anything that you've changed for yourself?
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.880]   And how has God been involved in your life?
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.920]   Today we're going to look at Psalm 66 and see how the Israelites have been reflecting
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.520]   and praising God in their lives to inspire us how we could reflect on our own lives as
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.520]   well.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.480]   So let's look at Psalm 66, verse one to five first.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.440]   It says, "Shout for joy to God, all the earth.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.360]   Sing about the glory of his name, make his praise glorious.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.080]   Say to God, how awesome are your deeds because of your great power, your enemies cringe before
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   you.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.920]   All the earth bow down to you.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.860]   They sing praise to you.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.840]   They sing the praises of your name.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.880]   Come and see what God has done, his awesome deeds for mankind."
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.200]   Right from the start, the Psalmist gives very clear guidance on how to praise and what to
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.400]   praise.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.840]   So how should we praise?
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.040]   We need to sing, we need to shout, we need to speak out God's praise.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.260]   But what do we share about?
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.720]   We will share about what he has done, his power and his name.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.280]   He is the God of provision.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.000]   He is the almighty God.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.400]   That is his name and that is his personality and character towards us.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.240]   In verse five, the Psalmist says directly, "Come and see what God has done."
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.680]   The English version is actually very closely translated to the Hebrew one because of the
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.680]   structure.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.920]   They both begin with the verbs, "Come and see."
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.400]   It's not thought, like praise is not a thought that we could go, "Oh, you get me God.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   You know what?
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   I praise you.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.400]   I will just keep it in my heart."
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.800]   It's not like that at all.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.200]   The Psalmist actually is calling his community to come and see what God has done in their
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   life.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.240]   It's so urgency.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.800]   Come quickly and see what God has done.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.100]   When we look back at what God has done in our lives, we naturally want to tell other
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.200]   people to come and see it, to come and experience it for yourself.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.600]   So I had this really good experience like that as well.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.520]   So this month, the beginning of December, I found this really delicious yakitori place
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.400]   just next to my building.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.560]   And so with just this month, I had it five times because I kept telling my friend, my
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.320]   family, my old co-workers to, you have to come and see the place because the favorite
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.560]   thing I love about that place is their eel skewers.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.800]   Do you eat eel here?
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.800]   Who eats eel?
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.680]   Oh, there are some of you who like, no, I'm not going to try that.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.400]   Well, this eel is so good because the skin is very crispy.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.960]   And when you bite into it, the juice just burst out and the meat is just so bouncy and
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.960]   it's just so delicious.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.360]   And I kept telling people, you have to come and see it.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.760]   And so I had this five times.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.920]   And so this is exactly what my reflection is like.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.780]   I have to go home and think about, did I reflect about what God has been in my life like that?
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:35.040]   If I savor it so much that I would want to share with other people as well.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.480]   And so then in verse five to seven and eight to 12, this is exactly what the Psalmist did.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.960]   He wants to testify God's goodness in two different angles.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.720]   The first one comes in verse five to seven.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.880]   It says, "Come and see what God has done, his awesome deeds for mankind.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.780]   He turned the sea into dry land.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.300]   They passed through the waters on foot.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.580]   Come, let us rejoice in him.
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.220]   He rules forever by his power.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.260]   His eyes watch the nations.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.640]   Let not the rebellious rise up against him."
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.280]   The Psalmist give thanks for the identity God has given them.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.300]   So the Israelites before that, before they were a nation, they actually had been slaves
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.200]   of the Egyptian slaves.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:31.040]   But God's action set them free and the identity changed to become God's people.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.260]   Even though the Psalmist never experienced God, you know, opening up the Red Sea for
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.760]   them and he actually walked through the dry land.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.320]   But this is the identity they refer to.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.240]   When you ask the Israelites, "Who are you?
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.240]   Where do you come from?"
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.840]   The first thought that come into their mind is the way that God set the nations free and
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.800]   give them identity.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.040]   When we talk about identity nowadays, we would say that, "Oh, I am," like if you ask me a
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.920]   few years ago, I would say, "Oh, I am a teacher.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.760]   I was someone else's daughter and I belong to this and that place."
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.040]   But the first thing that Israelites, when they want to praise God, the first thing that
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.820]   come out of their mouth is the identity, the relationship they had with God.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.000]   God set me free.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.360]   God took me out from some place, from slavery into freedom, into God's people.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.920]   So when I ask you, if you have to ask yourself this question, "What is your identity right
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920]   now?
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.980]   Who do you belong to?
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:35.340]   What would you have said differently or what inspired you to think about that question?"
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.000]   And so they ask people to come and see where they are at now.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.560]   I am now free.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.220]   I am now God's people.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.220]   So come and see.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:48.920]   It's not just to come and look at them, but to come and consider, come and think about
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920]   this.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.680]   Do you see who I am now?
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.780]   I am God's people.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.180]   This can't be achieved by just mere human striving.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.940]   This has to be done by God's power.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.560]   And you just have to look and consider and think about where I am now.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.400]   And in verse 8 to 12, it talked about the hardship.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.040]   But looking back, they understood something deeper through the process.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.080]   So let's have a look at verse 8 to 12.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.260]   Verse 8, it says, "Praise our God, all peoples.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.400]   Let the sounds of his praise be heard.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:31.000]   He has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.880]   For you, God, tested us.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.480]   You refined us like silver.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.760]   You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.920]   You let people ride over our heads.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.480]   We went through fire and water.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.880]   But you brought us to a place of abundance."
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:57.000]   When we remember God's work during hardships, we can see things differently.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.760]   There are many explanations or why suffering happens.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.920]   Sometimes there are no explanation why there are sufferings as well.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.720]   But God is always working.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.900]   He's always at work.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:16.440]   When the psalmists remember their difficulty, they see a purpose behind it.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.000]   In verse 10, the psalmist says God refines them like silver.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.080]   Even though they were trapped and burdened, even though they suffered, they saw this as
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.140]   spiritual refinement.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.760]   So how do you refine silver?
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.080]   How do you refine silver?
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:39.200]   Well, the first step is to heat up silver to really high temperature, as high as 1,000
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   degrees.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.840]   And then they put lead into it.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.880]   The lead attracts all the other impurities, all the other substances, and it actually
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.920]   weighted them down.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.320]   All the impurities will be weighted down until there's only silver left at the bottom.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.920]   But the craftsmen still need to watch over it.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:05.340]   They still need to discern whether the silver is pure enough by seeing how it reflects.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.240]   And so this is until the silver is mirror-like.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.480]   And the psalmist says God made them carry heavy burdens.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.240]   God led them through different challenges.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.480]   They went through fire and water.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.280]   But these were not the final destination.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:30.240]   The purpose for all of that is to bring them to a place of abundance.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:38.480]   Jesus said He came so we could have life and have it more abundantly.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.760]   What does abundant life look like?
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.520]   What does it mean to have an abundant life?
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.480]   Here's something interesting.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.760]   When Jesus talks about abundance, He never once mentioned our possessions.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.760]   Not once.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.200]   He talks about peace that goes beyond understanding.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.840]   He talks about joy that persists even in hard times.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.240]   He talks about relationship that fills our hearts.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:12.520]   The process of getting an abundant life requires our hearts to keep up with our understanding.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.840]   Sometimes there are good things that happen and we rejoice and we feel directly of God's
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:22.120]   love and God's mercy and grace, gracious things on us.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.200]   Sometimes we have to go through difficult times to adjust our hearts so that we can
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.180]   be refined.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:37.400]   The process of getting an abundant life requires our hearts to keep up with our understanding.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.880]   When does a craftsman know that the silver is good enough?
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.480]   It has high reflectivity and no impurities.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.920]   The craftsman have to watch over the silver's transformation.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.600]   They have to look at your transformation, the silver's transformation, and test its
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.040]   reflectivity.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.400]   Through difficulties, God refines us.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:10.200]   God constantly watches over my life so that it can better reflect His image.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.400]   And I'm thankful for our heavenly brother for doing that.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:20.440]   And today I've invited three friends to come up and share what God has been doing in their
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   life.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.400]   And today they would like to tell you to come and see what God has done in their lives.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.840]   Not just to see what God is doing, but think about it and consider how things are done.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.040]   And so the first one I'd like to invite Francesca, let's give her a warm welcome.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.000]   So we've always known Francesca, she is service leading, she's in the coffee team, she's in
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.620]   many different, different roles.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.480]   But today she's going to share about what God has been doing in her life.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.680]   So I'm going to give the time to Francesca.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.320]   Thank you.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.320]   Thank you, June.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.320]   Great.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:00.120]   I'm really excited, you know, to share with you what God has done in my life.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.720]   And I really love today's psalm.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.400]   And, you know, I am someone with passion, if you know me.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.800]   And when there's good restaurant, I'm one of those.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.560]   I'm like, come to this restaurant.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.400]   So I'd love to share with you, you know, one of the many great things that God has done
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.840]   in my life in 2024.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.920]   Now, but before that, I want to give you some a little bit of context of my background as
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.920]   well.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.480]   I wasn't raised a Christian.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:28.480]   And when I became a Christian in my early 20s, I became very passionate about my faith.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.120]   And I was so eager to share this gospel, this new knowledge that I gained.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.120]   And you know, you've got to share good news, the good things, right?
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.600]   Now, especially with my mom.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.040]   None of my families are Christian.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.920]   And I'm the only one at that time.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.840]   And it's always my hope and dreams for her to become Christian.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.040]   And most importantly, to know Jesus, to walk a life full of freedom and peace.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.200]   Now, however, it hasn't been easy.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.880]   My mom has been quite resistant in the past 10 years or so for various reasons.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:04.480]   Now, one of the main reasons is that we have a very important family member, someone that
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.880]   it's very important to her and our family.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.400]   He's a Buddhist.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:14.120]   And he was actually, he used to be a Catholic, and then he became a Buddhist, the whole family.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.600]   And this person is deeply devoted to his faith.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.000]   And he's super disciplined, highly educated, and very influential.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.320]   He actually would write books and give talks about Buddhism, right?
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.280]   So he's like a pastor Buddha kind of thing.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:33.280]   Now, I, you know, my mom has so much respect, you know, and looks up to him.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.740]   And actually, so do I, because growing up, he's someone that's so important to our family.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.680]   And I see what he, you know, what he does for this society.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.000]   And he contributes so much.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.560]   He's one of the kindest and most generous person I've known as well.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.120]   But since I became a Christian, I've seen him as the obstacle to my mom's faith journey.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.120]   Why?
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.520]   Because on one hand, I would share gospel and good news with my mom, right?
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.560]   And you know, talk about Jesus and what I know.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.240]   And then on the other hand, he would just, you know, tell him, tell my mom about Buddhism,
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.560]   you know, what you need to do.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.320]   And on one hand, I would try to get rid of all the statues at home, and you know, try
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.360]   to, you know, have, you know, a home that I feel peace.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.600]   But on the other hand, he would, you know, give my mom all these blessed statues, you
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.200]   know, Gunyama, and then like all these cards and, you know, all this music and sound.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.760]   And you can imagine it wasn't easy, especially not easy for my mom, you know, being, standing
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.320]   in between two people that she loves the most, having two different, very, two very different
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.320]   faiths.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.800]   Now, at that time, as a new and eager Christian, I was on fire to share gospel.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.400]   And I was very protective of my new faith.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.760]   And I was very protective of my mom.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.560]   I desperately wanted her to know Jesus, right?
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.080]   And of course, I don't want her to fall out of faith, right?
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:52.640]   Like, so out of that eagerness, good intention, I became, you know, would sometimes come across
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.280]   as forceful and impatient.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.860]   I'm sure some of you have come across those Christians once in your life, or you might
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.240]   be one of them too, you know.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.480]   You know, that eagerness made me become so impatient as I, you know, trying to share
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.480]   gospel.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.600]   Because I wanted to achieve something.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.720]   I wanted my mom to know Jesus, but she just wouldn't come around.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.040]   I felt so helpless.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.880]   And I just, you know, sometimes to a point, I just feel so frustrated.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.920]   I'm like, I can't do this.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.840]   And up to a point, I just gave up.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.840]   And I'm like, "Mom, you know, why do you?
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.160]   You know, believe Buddha, whatever.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.800]   You believe in whatever faith you want.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.360]   It's your life.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.000]   Whatever."
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.360]   Is it really whatever?
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   It's not really.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:41.760]   I think behind that, it was just that sense of disappointment and frustration and exhaustion.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.920]   Because I've tried, I've tried to share the news, I've tried to love her, and it just
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.400]   doesn't get to her.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.640]   So I was like, "It's impossible.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.640]   Whatever."
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.600]   Now, a few years ago, four or five years ago, someone from church, really grateful for this
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.920]   person, she prayed for me, you know, because throughout the year, she would pray, the whole
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.400]   community would come and pray for me and my family, especially my mom, right?
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:10.040]   And this person prayed for me, and she prophesied that my mom, she can see that my mom will
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:15.520]   go through a huge internal transformation, like a renovation inside of her, and that
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.800]   God will take care of her.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:24.040]   Now since then, God has softened my heart, and so many miracles have happened.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.800]   God has done so much in my family.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.240]   And my mom, long story short, that's a huge testimony, it will take up another 30 minutes,
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:37.120]   but long story short, we got rid of all the statues at home, all of them, and my mom willing
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.800]   to get rid of them.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:45.960]   And also, as my mom's heart's getting softer and softer, we eventually, we pray, and she
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.480]   prayed to accept Jesus Christ in her life.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.240]   Right, let's give praise to God.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.840]   But the story doesn't end here.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.520]   Now, after she accepted Jesus Christ, you know, she was still afraid to share with this
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.600]   family, important family member of ours, right?
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.680]   How do we tell this person that, "Oh, we chuck all your statues away."
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:13.200]   You know, those are, you know, it will come across disrespectful, right?
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.240]   But throughout this time, you know, God has really, really changed my heart and helped
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.080]   me realize that everyone has their own faith journey, you know, their own timing.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   Ultimately, it's God who changes people's heart, not me, not what I do and not do.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.320]   And just like how He changes my heart years ago.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.840]   So since then, you know, seeing all the changes in my heart, I start realizing I don't need
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.280]   to force my faith onto someone.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:42.560]   I don't need to persuade other people by reasons and logic because I can't, right?
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.000]   All I need to do is just to live it out by loving people and, you know, extending the
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.440]   love that I have received from God.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.960]   Now, the amazing thing happened.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:57.520]   Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to chat with this person one-on-one in a catch-up.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.240]   And throughout this conversation, it's very, very different than before.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.640]   Before I always want to find opportunity to prove him wrong, to, you know, to tell you
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.400]   that Jesus is better and my God is real, you know.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.680]   I was that eager.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.080]   But that conversation, it turns out the other way.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.000]   I just, I feel like God really transformed me, that I started to have this gentleness
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.320]   in me, that I listen and that I care.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.840]   And out of nowhere, I had this curiosity to just learn about him, understand where he's
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.840]   from.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   So I asked him, you know, I just want to know how come you, you know, you're once a Catholic
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.920]   and then now you became a Buddhist.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   What's behind that?
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.920]   What's your journey?
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.400]   You know, what are you pursuing?
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.120]   He is someone that's so disciplined, I tell you.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.000]   The way he pursued his faith, it's like something that I so admire.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.920]   And I want to do that for myself.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.360]   And I know out of curiosity, I asked him all the questions he shared.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.960]   And then, of course, he shared the reason why he didn't like Christians and he didn't
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.820]   believe this, you know, that just Jesus.
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:00.760]   And I heard him and I understood him and I empathized him because of his past hurt that
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.240]   experiences, right?
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.440]   And I wasn't there to neglect what he said, but I just to be there and heard his stories.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.920]   And then afterwards, then I gently, very gently just share with him my journey.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.960]   Oh, why do I believe in Jesus?
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.400]   And what do I know about Jesus?
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.960]   What did Jesus say, right?
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.720]   You're people of flaws, but I just tell him what I know about Jesus.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.960]   And then at the end of the conversation, he just looked at me and say this, "I see that
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.520]   you're very serious about your faith.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.640]   And what you said, what you're pursuing is good."
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.200]   And then there was this pause and then he continue, "Now that I understand what you're
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.520]   pursuing, I believe we're seeking the same thing, same God, just in different forms."
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.220]   Now, of course, I have a different views on that.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.400]   And then he said, "I will talk to your mom.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:57.880]   I will tell her to stop pursuing Buddha and to pursue your God wholeheartedly."
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.280]   Let's give praise to God.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.520]   What?
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.880]   Like this truly blew my mind at the moment.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.880]   I was like, what?
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.620]   He's no longer the obstacle?
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.440]   He's no longer the person that, you know, trying to stop my mom pursuing Jesus, but
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:17.960]   actually he, you know, actually what happened was he actually did call my mom afterwards
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.400]   and he met up with my mom.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.940]   He visited my mom and then he was like, he told my mom that, "Don't pursue Buddha now.
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.940]   Just pursue Jesus.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.120]   Just pursue the God that your daughter's following."
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.860]   How?
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.440]   This is impossible.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.800]   And again and again, God is just showing me that he is the God that can make the impossible
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.100]   possible like this worship songs that we're saying.
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.320]   And I was like, "God, you're so amazing."
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.820]   And in the past, even though I knew God, I didn't fully understand the true meaning of
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.920]   sharing gospel, right?
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.920]   I was just judgmental.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.880]   I tried to share it with my own ways and try to reasons, you know, persuade people with
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.880]   reasons and logics.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:02.720]   But throughout this time, God say, "My love, all I want you to do is just to love."
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.280]   And I realized I have experienced his love so much that, you know, I would just want
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.380]   to give God all the praise for all that he has shown me.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.160]   His love is so gentle and is so patient.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.980]   God, he's so patient with me.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:21.360]   And I'm just so thankful that I got to first experience his love, then I get to share this
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.520]   with my family and my mom.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.960]   And who would have thought this uncle, this family member would actually turn around and
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.600]   do this and be on my side, assist me to persuade my mom?
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.760]   Only God can do this, right?
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.640]   So I also want to say thank you for my community because they've been praying for me days to
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.640]   days about my mom and my family.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.880]   I think God put people in my life to walk with me in this journey.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.520]   So I'm just so thankful that God is the one who accomplishes the work.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:57.760]   All I need to do is just to trust him and walk along in this journey with him.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.760]   Thank you guys.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.840]   Let's give a big hand to Francesca.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.320]   Thank you so much.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.400]   And I think a lot of families have, maybe you have been through this as well.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.840]   You have been praying for your family member and you want your mom or your dad, your uncle
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.400]   to believe in Christ.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   And it's been five years, maybe 10 years or maybe over 20 decades, 20 decades.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.280]   It still didn't happen.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:29.320]   But when you see something happen like that, you know that it is not because of human striving.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.200]   It is because of God's greatness and power.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:36.640]   And so we thank you, Francesca, for sharing her story and encourage us because what God
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.080]   has done in her life is going, this is what God does.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.920]   And it's going, he's going to do it in every single one's life as well.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.680]   And secondly, I'd like to invite Matthias to come and share with us.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:53.160]   Matthias, someone that in the church very, not too long ago, and he is amazing.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.800]   He is such a willing to heart to serve and to reach out to people.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.120]   So I'd like to give the time to Matthias.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.120]   Thank you.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.120]   Thanks June.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.120]   Hi.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.040]   Like she said, my name is Matthias.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.840]   My family and I have been coming to the Vian Yuen Long for a couple of months now.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.120]   They're not here today.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.560]   They weren't feeling well.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.560]   But I was okay.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.440]   So you know, maybe there was a reason.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.080]   Maybe someone's supposed to hear this today.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.800]   So yeah, sure.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.040]   Anyway, I've been in Hong Kong.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.960]   My wife and I were missionaries here in Hong Kong for the last nine, 10 years now.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.360]   And we have three kids.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.240]   They were all amazing in many different ways.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:42.160]   And when June had asked for me to share my testimony, I took a deep breath.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:48.120]   And I think what I have here is maybe a little bit of an honest self-reflection of this year
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.840]   and my journey with God this year.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.920]   I think 2024 has been an intriguing year.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.640]   It's been very different for me for many different reasons.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.920]   And I think what I've taken out of it is I have learned more about God in a different
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.240]   way than I had before.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:12.200]   And I think that's an amazing thing to do, that God is so big and so wide that we can
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.480]   -- there are many different ways we can learn more about him, you know, whether it be through
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.480]   the word, through his voice, and through different people.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:27.480]   I think when June was sharing about Psalm 66, I think verse 8 and 10 really reflect
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.280]   maybe my journey this year.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.760]   And verse 8 to 10 says -- I'll just read it out.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.160]   It says, "Praise our God, all peoples.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.480]   Let the sound of his praise be heard.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.760]   He has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.080]   For you, God, tested us.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.840]   You refined us like silver."
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:51.680]   And I think looking back this year, there have been many highs and many lows.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.560]   But when I look back, I think there has been a lot of growth.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:01.320]   I think there's a bit of more a reflection of maybe the maturity that I've grown, that
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.640]   I can look and see, oh, I look high of maturity.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:11.440]   And that's really just all praise to God.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:18.000]   So this year, my family and I, we decided to take a sabbatical.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.400]   If you're not sure what sabbatical means, it's just really taking a pause from what
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.640]   we've been doing.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.240]   So like I said, we've been missionaries with our missions organization for the last 9,
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.520]   10 years.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.160]   And we decided to take a break.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:39.400]   And it kind of led to also us stepping out from our positions and really becoming unemployed.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:45.640]   So we felt that we were going to take a year to pause and reflect.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.960]   It's a long time.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:54.800]   And for the first six months, we were not to make any decisions or pray or talk about
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   our future.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.280]   We were just supposed to stop.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.560]   We were just supposed to rest, although with three kids.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.080]   Rest is a very different -- it takes a very different meaning.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.640]   But yes, so to rest and not do anything.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.520]   And I don't know if you're like me.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:21.000]   When you're faced with something, oh, don't think about the future and you have no plans
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.760]   for the future, it kind of just keeps coming back.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.040]   And it became very difficult.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:38.000]   Because for me, in our situation, one, well, there's -- what are we going to do?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Right?
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   There's so much uncertainty.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.720]   There are so many different potential opportunities as well for us to do.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.520]   And I'm from Singapore, although my family lives in Australia.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.240]   Long story.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.720]   My wife's from America.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.400]   And we live in Hong Kong.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.600]   So there are many different directions we could take as well.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.940]   We could live in all these different countries.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.820]   We could remain on the mission field.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.920]   We could not remain on the mission field.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:10.380]   We could, you know, be missionaries in a different location.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:15.400]   And so there are many different directions that we could have taken.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.560]   And there are many different opportunities as well.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.560]   People come and talk to us.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.640]   They're like, oh, would you be interested in doing this?
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.080]   And I'm like, maybe.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.080]   I don't know.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.800]   I can't tell you yet.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:33.920]   Or if you're a little older and you are a grandparent who loves grandchildren, you might
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.200]   be, hey, maybe you want to come live in this country that I live so that I can see my
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.520]   grandparent -- my grandchildren more.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.080]   And we're like, yeah, sure.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   That's possible.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.080]   Maybe.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.080]   Maybe.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.080]   You know?
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:54.280]   And free child care is also good.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:30:03.320]   But I think what I'm trying to say is there are many different things that we could do.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.120]   And a lot of people who offer had good intentions.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.000]   No one was like, oh, you should do this or you need to do that.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.480]   One other factor in our lives is that as missionaries we live on financial support.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.200]   So people support us financially.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:21.760]   Whether it be churches or individuals, family and friends.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.360]   Because they believe in what we're doing.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:28.000]   They believe in the work that we're doing here in Hong Kong.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   But guess what?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.200]   This year we're not doing any work.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:37.760]   And so we have a responsibility to tell them, oh, hey, these are our plans.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.960]   This is what God is saying to us.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.840]   This is our direction in our lives.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.760]   But there was no direction.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.840]   So then what?
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.160]   And honestly, all supporters were great.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.480]   None of them actually asked me any of these questions.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.760]   None of them were like, okay, what are you guys going to do now?
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.000]   And how's my money being used?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.920]   Actually, they were all very supportive and all very great.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.600]   I think a lot of the pressure was self inflicted.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:14.880]   A lot of maybe the worry to answer these potential questions down the line was all self inflicted.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.520]   That I started to worry.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.640]   I started to question.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.120]   And yeah.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:30.560]   It made that time, you know, very -- just uncertain.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.920]   Very unsure of our future.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:44.600]   I think especially in that time as well, I was -- you know, when we would then seek God
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:51.280]   or ask questions about our future, there was nothing.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280]   You know?
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.320]   And it's not like God was not present.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.400]   You know, in worship or in my quiet time.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   He was there.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   He was present.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.120]   You know, you feel the love and the peace.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:08.800]   But in regards to seeking direction and asking these questions, nothing.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.600]   And that silence was very loud.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.600]   Right?
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.600]   It was very loud.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.240]   And you know, God -- I'm sure you all get to that.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.800]   But it was not an easy time at that time.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.400]   Because of what I felt was, you know, our responsibility.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.940]   What I felt was just -- I guess maybe in my mind, what would be great, right?
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.760]   Maybe you all would think that way too.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:41.600]   Is that if God would just say, okay, this is what I have for you next.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.000]   Enjoy the rest of your sabbatical.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Oh!
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.200]   Wouldn't that be such a joy?
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.200]   Right?
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.400]   Like, yes, future settled.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.240]   Now just rest.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   Peace.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.240]   You know?
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.960]   But for some reason, and God has his reasons.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.880]   It did not work out that way.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:07.120]   I think what I learned was that there was a need to really just take time to process,
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   take time to end well a previous season, a long season that we have been in.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.520]   So that we will be better prepared.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:20.320]   So that we would not be carrying any negative baggage into the next thing that we were about
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.900]   to go into.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:22.900]   And guess what?
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.900]   That took six months.
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.900]   Right?
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.240]   And that's our journey.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.080]   Our journey might be different.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.920]   But it was necessary, actually.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.920]   It was needed.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:44.200]   And I think what also ended up really helping in that time was just being -- going through
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   it with my wife.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   Right?
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.440]   That we were doing it together.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.440]   Right?
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.640]   That we were always then when faced with those questions that would come up, we would be
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:58.240]   like, "But God said we weren't supposed to do anything in this first six months.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:06.440]   We weren't supposed to make a decision or decide about anything in this first six months."
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.440]   Right?
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.680]   So what I think was really encouraging for me was having someone to -- and of course
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.200]   for me to her -- was that we had each other to be able to encourage each other.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.360]   To remind us of what God had said.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.660]   Because it's not like he didn't say anything at all.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.320]   He did say something.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.320]   And he expected us to, like, "Hey, first six months.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.320]   That's it.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.320]   Don't worry about it."
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   Okay?
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:37.520]   And having that -- I guess now I'm marrying my wife, too -- encouraged me to, "Hey, don't
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.520]   worry about it.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.560]   One step at a time.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.400]   When it's the right time, then God will speak."
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:51.200]   And I think for us, you know, maybe you don't have a partner, but we have a community to
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.800]   encourage us, to remind us of what God has said.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.600]   To hold on to those truths.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   Right?
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.880]   To then say, "Okay.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.480]   Yes, all these things are worrying.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.480]   Things are uncertain.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:10.640]   I might not have enough to pay rent, but this is what God has said.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.880]   Let's hold on.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.880]   Let's trust."
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:20.080]   And, you know, one other thing is the knowing that I know.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.000]   I have heard God speak before.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.920]   I know that God speaks.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.720]   These are biblical truths that are in my life and in our lives.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.720]   Right?
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.960]   It's a foundation of our faith.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.320]   And that in this time that we can hold on to that, that he does not leave us.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.920]   He does not forsake us.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   Right?
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.440]   These are things that we know that are true.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.600]   And as we hold on to them, we can take courage.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.680]   We can be encouraged.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:54.560]   So fast forward to June when it was actually time to start praying about our future.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.400]   It was honestly such a great process.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.640]   We took some time to debrief.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:11.120]   And in that time, we slowly started praying more, talking to people, talking to mentors,
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.160]   people that we trust.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.800]   Okay, this is the time we felt like the doors are open.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.840]   What do you have for us, God?
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.920]   And it was perfect.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.360]   God slowly spoke.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:31.560]   God showed us different things that we were supposed to do, what was on his heart.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:37.120]   And we slowly gained direction, you know, purpose once again.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   Right?
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:44.160]   So for me, you know, we just felt, at least for us, we felt like, oh, we're supposed to
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.200]   remain here in Hong Kong.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.680]   That's what God has for us right now.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:52.240]   We were supposed to serve more in this area, in Yuen Long.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:58.080]   You know, we've lived here in the Yuen Long area for the whole time here in Hong Kong.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.320]   You know, we've started to gain relationships.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:05.880]   Honestly, started to finally gain traction with locals here, you know, in the village
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.880]   that we live in, and the people here in Hong Kong, the relationships that we build.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.840]   And he's like, those things are important.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.480]   It takes time to do that.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.560]   Don't just let them go, you know, build on that.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:31.960]   And I think when I look back now, I'm reminded, you know, that yes, God did speak in that
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:39.480]   first, before, when he said, in the first six months, just don't do anything.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   Don't talk about it.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.600]   Because when it became time, he did speak.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.600]   And it became more clear.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:51.760]   I don't know if you can understand, right, that when there's silence, and then now that's
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:58.640]   the opposite of word, it became more clear of, okay, now I really know, that I really
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:04.520]   know that this is the direction that I'm supposed to do.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:10.840]   And so I think when I look back in the whole year, I feel like I've learned to trust God
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:17.920]   more in this different way, right, that God does guide us.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.640]   And sometimes we don't need to keep asking, is it this one?
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   How about this one?
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:29.240]   Right, if he said something, and it's been clear, let's just remember that.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:34.880]   And have that people next to us to encourage us, hey, don't worry about that.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.240]   God will make it good in his time.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.800]   This is what he has already said.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   Don't forget that.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.800]   Hold firm.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:50.080]   And maybe that's a little bit of reflection of one's maturity in Christ as well.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:59.760]   And maybe that's reflected in Hebrews 5, when God says, the writers say, you should be seeking
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:06.440]   food and eating food instead of drinking milk, like what you're supposed to receive now.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:15.320]   And I think I like to say that I've matured in my faith a little bit more in this season
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:21.680]   in regards to receiving direction, in regards to hearing from God.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.920]   And it comes with practice, right?
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:29.200]   I think hearing God's voice is something that as you practice more, you're more attuned
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.200]   to.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.160]   So I would encourage that as well.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.280]   And God knows what we can handle.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.660]   God knows where we're at.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:45.240]   He knew I could handle the silence, even though in the midst of it, there are times there
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.640]   where just what is happening.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:55.800]   But he knew that I could, because when I look back now, I did it, we did it.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:03.360]   Would I say I would like it that way, moving forward, that God is silent more?
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.960]   I don't know.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.080]   I don't know.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:12.160]   But of course, God's never going to be permanently silent to us.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.640]   That's it.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.240]   God bless.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.200]   Thank you so much, Matthias.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:26.080]   I think a lot of times we praise God for his work, but then it's seldom to hear that to
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.680]   praise God because he's silent.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.760]   And I think that's really important to trust him.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.200]   And I think that refinement was really beautiful as well.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.100]   So thank you so much for sharing.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:39.640]   And last but not least, I'd like to invite Novia to come up to share with us.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:45.080]   I first know Novia through Alpha, and today I'd like to invite her to come and share her
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.640]   journey in 2024 as well.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:53.120]   Hello, everyone.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.120]   My name is Novia.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:01.860]   It was an honor for me to share my story between God and me with you.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:03.080]   So here it goes.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.560]   Two years ago, I suffered from anxiety issue.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.080]   I felt very insecure and unconfident about life and future.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:16.540]   I didn't know what was the purpose of life and was fearful at uncertainty in life.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:22.600]   Every morning, I would spend 10 minutes lying in bed, feeling anxious and hopeless.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.680]   Even though I believe in God, I tend to believe in human effort so I can make sure things
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.400]   were in control.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:34.280]   I also find it hard and unrealistic to believe God's word in the Bible.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.600]   Do not be anxious about anything.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.600]   This is Hong Kong.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.680]   How can you not be anxious about things in Hong Kong?
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:47.760]   Your career, finance, expectation from others, setbacks in life, aspiration that you cannot
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.920]   achieve, you name it.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.760]   I bet every one of us encounter these problems in our lives.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.840]   When I talked to my friend, Dorothy, about my fear, she brought me to the fine Yunlong
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:02.680]   and encouraged me to seek answer from God.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:07.080]   God then brought me into a journey of healing and it was not easy.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:13.360]   I still held on to my old habits of controlling things and didn't like God to lead me.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.320]   My faith was weak.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.080]   Fortunately, God is always faithful.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:25.800]   Whenever I felt like giving up, God kept giving me signs that said, "I'm here and I know.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   Just don't give up yet."
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:33.160]   I slowly opened my heart to God and learned to trust Him.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:38.840]   By listening to sermon every Sunday, I learned new perspectives from His words and I understood
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.800]   He wanted me to abandon fear.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.280]   On some bad days when I didn't feel like going to church, He sent the Holy Spirit to urge
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.360]   me.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.360]   And guess what?
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.320]   In those sermons, He spoke to me directly and those are the words that I needed most
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.400]   at that time.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:59.800]   During that period of time, my favorite scripture was, "I can do all things through Christ who
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.280]   strengthens me."
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:08.080]   Whenever anxiety started to creep in, I declared this scripture in His name and as the identity
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.280]   of His daughter.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:18.860]   By reading Bible and talking to Him every day, anxiety and worry started to fade away.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:24.320]   In replacement, there was peace and the expectation that He would prepare for me.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.400]   I felt true freedom in Him and my heart was finally at rest.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:34.400]   Last month, my elder brother was admitted to hospital for a surgical biopsy.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:39.800]   A tumor was found near my brother's lung and the doctor had to make a cut at his chest
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.680]   to obtain the tissue.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.080]   The tissue would then be sent to test if it is abnormal.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.560]   There may be a chance of cancer.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:54.480]   Ever since I knew about this, I prayed to God and asked Him to give me strength to support
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.780]   my family.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:00.700]   On the night before the surgery, my brother was deep in worry.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.400]   The Holy Spirit led me to share with my brother my encounter with God.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:10.880]   After I shared my story, my brother said, "He is real."
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:16.080]   Eventually my parents, my brother and I joined hands for prayer in the hospital.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.840]   When we finished our prayer, my brother was in tears.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:29.600]   My brother is now discharged from the hospital and there is nothing bad in him.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.560]   Several days ago when I sent Christmas greetings in the family WhatsApp group, my mother said,
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:40.600]   "It was my daughter's God who made my son's surgery a successful one.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.800]   Many thanks to Him."
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.160]   This experience had a great impact on me.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:51.640]   One, instead of worrying like I usually did, God gave me peace and calmness to support
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:52.880]   my family.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.720]   Two, He used me to touch the hearts of my family who are non-Christians, very traditional
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.640]   Chinese and only know Buddhism in their lives.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:08.400]   Three, He refined me in a way a pessimist like me could also bring hope and comfort
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.880]   to others.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:16.640]   When I look back on this journey, I think God intentionally led me into this situation
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.480]   so I needed to seek change.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.880]   In response, God worked like a farmer in me.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:28.560]   He took out the barren soil in me, fertilized and watered my heart with His words, gave
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.640]   me sunshine when I was in darkness.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.960]   There is only one hope, one purpose.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.400]   It is to grow good things in me.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.080]   In the past, if God told me, "That will be a difficult journey for you," and I definitely
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.080]   would say, "No, I'll pass."
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:52.060]   But now, I'm forever thankful that God let me have this lesson which led me to joy, freedom,
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:53.720]   and hope.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:46:01.360]   I am no longer a slave to fear.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:06.360]   To wrap up, I would like to share an extract of a song that best describes my journey.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.840]   I brought it up in a desperate prayer.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.720]   "Lord, why are you keeping me here?"
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.600]   Then He said to me, "Child, I'm planting seeds.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:21.600]   I'm a good God and I have a good plan, so trust that I'm holding a watering can.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.720]   And someday you'll see the flowers grow in the valley.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.760]   When I'm on the mountain and looking down below, I'll see a valley of flowers that need
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.480]   the time to grow.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.120]   And I thank you for the rain, the hurt, and days of pain."
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.040]   May God continue to bless and heal you in 2025.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.040]   Thank you.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.680]   Thank you so much.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.840]   Thank you so much, Novia.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.200]   Thank you for your courage to share about something difficult.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:55.600]   Thank you for opening up the hearts to let people in to see what the journey is like.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:59.440]   It's not easy to feel like this every single day.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:04.560]   It's not easy to have to overcome fear, overcome challenging times.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:10.760]   But as we have been hearing about God working in different people's lives in different ways,
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:15.680]   God is doing that the same for you today, that He is not stopping, but maybe it would
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.400]   look different for you.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:24.440]   And so let's sit and think about what 2024 has looked like for you.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:31.840]   We're going to have a time of quietness, and I'd like to invite you to look at your 2024.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.440]   How has God been involved in your life?
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.120]   What has He done?
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:44.200]   Maybe it didn't look like what was shared on the stage, but I'm sure as we reflect,
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:52.480]   to see, and to consider, you can find God's footprint in every single step of your way.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:59.480]   [music]
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   [music]
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:19.480]   [music]
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:29.480]   [music]
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:39.480]   [music]
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:49.480]   [music]
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:59.480]   [music]
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   [music]
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   [music]
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:33.480]   [music]
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:40.600]   Maybe 2024 has been a really good year for you, that you sense God's direct grace and
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:45.680]   favor upon your life, and we want to celebrate that.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:49.120]   Maybe your 2024 looks difficult.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:54.440]   Maybe there are some hiccups along the way, but God is in it.
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:57.200]   God was there in Francesca's life.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:06.160]   He moved hearts and people and helped Francesca to see what God is doing in their family and
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:13.740]   helped her to have a genuine curiosity to her uncle, her family member.
[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:17.200]   Maybe there were a lot of waiting for you in 2024.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:24.840]   Maybe you were opened up with many directions and you feel confused and you feel lost, but
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:30.920]   Matthias reminded us that God is in his life.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:36.680]   His silence was actually a way to mature him.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:47.760]   And Matthias at the end celebrated the silence, God's silence, to mature him.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:53.880]   Maybe there were times when you feel anxious and you feel there's no way to handle all
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:59.360]   the different situations, just like what Novia has been sharing.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:04.600]   But God was working in her life and her family's life.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:11.400]   And when we hold on to God's word, when we gather people around us, we can overcome,
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:17.760]   not because we can, but because God is moving, God is working.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:24.520]   And as we are looking ahead in 2025, I would like you to stretch out your hands to receive
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.320]   the gift that God is giving you.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.080]   God is giving you wisdom.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.520]   God is giving you grace and open doors.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:41.760]   God is giving you his precious son, Jesus, in you, surrounding you with people.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:49.520]   We often feel like a new year is uncertain, but what we can hold on to, the certainty
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:58.720]   that we can hold on to is Jesus in our lives doing this with us.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:06.720]   And hold on church, hold on to God's word, hold on to what he has said.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.520]   He is for you.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:14.800]   He is in you.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:19.160]   Let's all stand up and respond to him in a way that only our voices can.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.740]   (gentle music)
