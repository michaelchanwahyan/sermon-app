1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 So I have the habit of taking songs and changing lyrics.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 And so even though it's going to be a little bit cringe,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I'm going to do that for you, okay?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 So I came up with this earlier.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 I was listening to one of the songs playing, and it says,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 "I want to wish you a singed-on firelock.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 I want to wish you a singed-on firelock.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I want to wish you a singed-on firelock

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 from the bottom of my heart."

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Yeah.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 [applause]

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Yeah.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 So, yeah, I know.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Thank you for making me feel better about this.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 But I have actually a question for us as we get started,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 and it is this.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 What is your favorite Christmas song?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Now, this could be a Christmas carol.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 This can be a pop song.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 This can be a classical piece.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And I'm actually not asking a rhetorical question.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I actually really want to hear from you,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 and this includes you kids.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 You know, what is your favorite song?

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 So if you have one to share, just raise your hand,

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 and I'll call on you and share with me your song.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Yes.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 "Last Christmas."

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 "Last Christmas."

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 [applause]

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Right there.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 You and I.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 It's my favorite.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Good one, good one.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Actually, I'm going to talk about that later.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 That was perfect.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 What else?

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 What else do we have?

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Yes.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 My son's favorite is "Mistletoe."

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 "Mistletoe."

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Okay.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 [laughter]

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 So I don't know that one, but I'm sure it's a great one.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I heard something over here.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Yes, go ahead.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 "All I Want for Christmas."

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 What?

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 [laughter]

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Is it that one?

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 "All I Want for Christmas is You."

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Yes.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 That's also a good one.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Mariah Carey.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Okay, one more.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Let's do one more.

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Yes, back there.

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 What's that?

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 So there's a classic as well.

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 So, hey, these are some incredible songs that you chose

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 to share with us.

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Thank you so much also for everyone who did that

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 who was brave.

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Thank you.

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Appreciate that.

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Now, I don't know if you've ever noticed that around Christmas

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 there's all this singing, and there are all these songs,

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 whether Christian or in pop culture,

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 and there's just something about Christmas that even changes

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 our playlists.

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Like on Spotify, it's like the only time where I wrote in

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 quite different playlists in the year, right?

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And so why is that?

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 What is it about Christmas that brings forth all these songs,

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 all this singing?

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And I don't know if you knew, but actually in the Bible,

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 there's also three Christmas songs that are part

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 of the biblical story.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 So I want to share with you today my favorite song

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 and show you something amazing in it.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 So let me take you to Luke chapter 2,

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 and starting in verse 8, it says this.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 "And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby,

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 keeping watch over their flock at night.

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And an angel of the Lord appeared to them,

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 and the glory of the Lord shone around them,

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 and they were terrified.

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid.

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all people.

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you.

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 He is the Messiah, the Lord.

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 This will be a sign to you.

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.'

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Suddenly a great company of heavenly hosts appeared

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 with the angel, praising God and saying,

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 'Glory to the God in the highest heaven and on earth peace

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 to those on whom his favor rests.'"

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 So that part is actually a song that I'm talking about.

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And then continuing in verse 15,

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 "When the angels had left them and gone into heaven,

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 the shepherds said to one another,

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 'Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened,

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 which the Lord has told us about.'

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 and the baby who was lying in a manger.

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 When they had seen him, they spread the word

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 concerning what had been told them about this child,

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 and all who heard it were amazed with the shepherds,

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 what the shepherds said to them.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 But Mary treasured up all these things

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 and pondered them in her heart.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 for all the things they had heard and seen,

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 which were just as they had been told."

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 So for me, it's fascinating that the birth of Jesus

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 brings forward singing, this joy.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And I don't know if you've ever had this experience in your life.

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 You receive some good news and you cannot help but to sing,

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 maybe do a little happy dance.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 You know, people do that in different ways.

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And there's just something that is so good

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 that just needs to be expressed, you know,

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 through singing or dancing.

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 But what is it about Jesus, this child that is born,

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 that brings forth these songs and this praise?

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 You know, what is it? Why is that?

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 So I want to share with you some thoughts on that.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 So first, an angel appears to the shepherds in the fields,

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 and there's something he says,

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 "I bring you good news that will cause great joy

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 for all the people.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 He is the Messiah, and he is the Lord."

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 So the good news is announced by the angel.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 He uses three really loaded and charged words.

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 It's like dropping three, you know, bombs with so much meaning,

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 basically, on the shepherds.

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And it's even hard to do justice to talk about

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 what these three words in that first century context meant.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Savior, Messiah, Lord.

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I'm going to just very briefly talk about them.

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 But there's so much more to it.

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 But let me just briefly talk about it.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 The first one is Savior.

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Jesus' birth is good news because he's a Savior,

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 because he has come to be born, to die for our sins,

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 so that we can be restored back to the Father,

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 that we can experience wholeness and also peace in our lives.

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So Jesus is Savior.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 He comes because we need rescuing.

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 You know, if there is no need for a Savior,

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 no Savior needs to come.

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 But Jesus comes because we need it.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And secondly, Jesus' birth is good news because he's the Messiah.

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 There were all these--there were expectations.

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 God promised that the liberator would come to set his people free

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 and restore them back to prominence and establish God's rule.

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And so now the angel announces to the Israelites this promise

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 after 400 years of silence from the prophets,

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 that this promise of a Messiah is finally being fulfilled.

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 This is incredible news.

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And then finally, we're also told that Jesus is Lord.

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 That means that Jesus is God.

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 He's God with us.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And that's very important because it means that he has the power

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 and authority to actually bring about the saving and the healing in our lives.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Because if I die for somebody, it doesn't do anything for anyone really.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 But when Jesus does that, he really has the power and authority to save

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 and to move and to act in our lives.

171
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 So it's no wonder that the angels--that they hear this--the shepherds,

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 they hear this incredible message from the angels,

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 and then the angels can't help themselves.

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And so first there's one, now suddenly a host of angels appears.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 The whole sky is filled.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 A host means it's basically a term actually for army.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 So there's an army of angels, a large group of angels filling the sky,

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 and they are singing and praising God.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 They're saying, "Glory to God in the highest heaven and on earth,

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 peace to those on whom his favor rests."

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And so the angel songs, it adds further to describing what this good news is.

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 So first we had Savior, Messiah, Lord.

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Now we have also the word peace.

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So their song expresses that God's desire for all people is peace.

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Now this could sound very generic, but it's actually a very powerful

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 and important concept.

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Underlying this is actually a Hebrew word,

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 even though the biblical text is in Greek,

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 but it was Hebrews who were writing and authoring this.

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And that's the word shalom.

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And shalom in the shortest, simplest way means wholeness,

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 that Jesus has come to bring wholeness,

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 wholeness in our relationship with God,

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 wholeness in our relationship with each other,

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 wholeness in relationship even to creation,

196
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 wholeness in relationship to ourselves,

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 because a lot of times we're even at odds with ourselves.

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And so that is what the angel is announcing.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And you know this peace, this shalom, is actually available to you right now.

200
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 You might not feel that way, but this peace is available to you right now.

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So the peace that Jesus brings, it's different than worldly peace.

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Worldly peace is usually something we have good finances,

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 we have good relationships, everything is going right in our lives,

204
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 then we have peace.

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 And even then, sometimes we actually don't have peace, right?

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Even if all those things are in place.

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 But then when our circumstances change,

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 and maybe those things, they fall out of place,

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 then that peace is gone.

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And we lack peace.

211
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 But what the angel is announcing is that Jesus,

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 he brings a peace that is not dependent on our circumstances,

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 that is greater than our circumstances.

214
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 That it does not matter what is going on in your life,

215
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 that Jesus can meet you, and he can give you peace

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 despite the storms, the challenges that you are facing.

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And it really is a supernatural thing,

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 because we cannot do this on our own.

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 It's only something that God can do in our lives.

220
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 So I don't know if you are having peace this Christmas.

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I've been a pastor long enough that I know that there's a lot of challenges.

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Maybe there's relationship problems, maybe there's finance problems,

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 family problems, personal failures, health problems, emotional problems.

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 All these things that can steal the peace, the hope, the joy that we have,

225
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 they can pull the rug from underneath us in our lives.

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 But that's why Jesus came.

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 That's why he's born.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 He wants to restore us, to bring hope, to bring peace, to bring wholeness.

229
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 You know, where there's brokenness, where we're a mess.

230
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 And he wants to meet us in our uncertainties, in our questions, in our struggles.

231
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And he wants to give us his peace and his wholeness

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 that only God can give, that nothing else in this world can bring.

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And this peace is found when we have a personal relationship with Jesus.

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And when we learn to just live in this relationship,

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 when we learn to live in this trust,

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 and learn to walk through things with him and depend on him,

237
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 the Spirit of God brings us peace upon our lives.

238
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So Jesus, he came, he was born to die,

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 because he loves you so much.

240
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 He came, he laid down his life so that we can be forgiven,

241
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 so that our relationship that is broken with God can be restored,

242
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 and to bring just his wholeness and his goodness into our lives.

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And so with Jesus we can face anything.

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 He loves you, he's for you, he's not against you.

245
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 He has given everything.

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 He was God eternally,

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 and he humbles himself, he was born as a little helpless child,

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 so that he can reveal to us God's love,

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 reveal to us how he feels about us,

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 and then ultimately lay down his life for us.

251
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 So that's why Jesus came, to bring salvation,

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 to bring his peace, to bring wholeness into our brokenness.

253
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 But it even gets, you know, this news actually gets better.

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 The good news of Christ's birth is not just good news for a select few.

255
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 It's not just for the super Christian,

256
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 it's not just for those who always do good,

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 it's not for those who've been living this perfect track record life.

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 In verse 10 it says, you know,

259
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 that the good news will cause great joy for all the people.

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 So this good news is available for all.

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Sometimes we feel it's just for those special people who have their life all together.

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 It might even seem that those who are on the margins,

263
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 those who are struggling, that Christmas and this whole Jesus and all this peace,

264
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 that's not for them, it's not for us.

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 But when the angel appeared to shepherds,

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 who were people who were on the margins,

267
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 who were people, you know, they were not good with social relationships,

268
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 so they had the job as a shepherd.

269
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And they were marginalized in society, were looked down upon.

270
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 But God chose to reveal this good news to them.

271
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And by doing that he's saying, you are significant.

272
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 This good news is for you.

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 This is not just for people in the center of power

274
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 or for the people who are the majority stockholders of this company.

275
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 This is good news for everyone.

276
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Doesn't matter what social status, doesn't matter what life record track you're on.

277
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 So this means whether you are Christian here or not,

278
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 whether you are living a good life or you're living a bad life,

279
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 whether you feel close to God or right now God seems as far away as you can imagine,

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 the good news of Christmas is for you.

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And it is available to you because it is grounded not in your goodness,

282
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 not in your behavior, but in God's love, his character, his grace and mercy for you.

283
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 He has chosen to love you.

284
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 He has given everything for you.

285
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 He is for you.

286
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And he is offering us this relationship and this peace to us.

287
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And so the peace that is available through Jesus is God's gracious and undeserved gift offered to all.

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Doesn't matter who you are.

289
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Doesn't matter if you feel like you're not qualified.

290
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 It is for you.

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 And so that's why this is my favorite Christmas song in the Bible.

292
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Because this truly is good news for everyone, not just for a few.

293
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Now what I love about the story is that it's not only the angels singing and praising God,

294
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 but actually they're declaring this great news and they're inviting other people to join and sing.

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And that's also an invitation to us to join in with singing and with praise in this good news.

296
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Now don't worry, I'm actually not going to make you sing like I did earlier.

297
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And there's actually something deeper and more important to the singing.

298
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 There's actually deeper parts, so let me explain this.

299
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 In the story we see that the shepherds, they receive that announcement.

300
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And they could have just gone, "Oh, thanks for letting us know," and they can move on with their lives.

301
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 But they go and they see for themselves that what the angels had is truly true.

302
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And then they cannot help but also join in singing.

303
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 They receive this good news themselves.

304
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 This good news has moved from kind of this announcement out there to suddenly it's become personal good news.

305
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It's good news for them personally, not for other people, but for them personally.

306
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 That Jesus is Savior and Messiah and Lord.

307
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 So there's a shift that takes place.

308
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And the same is true for us.

309
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 This is good news of Christmas.

310
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 It needs to be something that we receive.

311
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 So we need to receive this good news that breaks into the night, even in the darkest nights of our lives, of our souls.

312
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 We can't earn God's love and His saving and holiness bringing work.

313
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 We can only receive it and have Him meet us in whatever it is that is going on.

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Have break into the darkness, the struggle, the pain, whatever it is.

315
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 But we need to receive it.

316
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 It's like any gift.

317
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It's only yours when you actually take it and receive it.

318
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 So I want to share with you how you can respond to this incredible news of Jesus' saving and peace bringing work.

319
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And I'm going to go a little bit out on a limb here, kind of like earlier in my message.

320
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I'm going to use a little bit of a silly illustration, but I think it will make it helpful.

321
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 And it's from what I was saying, the Christmas song from Wham!, "Last Christmas."

322
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And so, production, can you please play the music?

323
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart, but the very next day you gave it away.

324
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 This year to save you from tears, I give it to someone special.

325
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 So we've heard these lyrics, right?

326
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Now, while this song is of course about romantic love and heartbreak and everything,

327
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 we join in singing and praising God by giving our hearts to the one who is truly special.

328
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Now, we've been giving our heart to other things.

329
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 We think we find peace and wholeness in other things.

330
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 So we go searching, we go scrambling, we try hard.

331
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 We try to find whether it's peace in other relationships,

332
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 we try to find peace in finances, material possessions, and all these things.

333
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And we're trying so hard, but they just can't deliver.

334
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 They can't do it. They can't bring the peace of God.

335
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Because we're trying to get these things to do what only God can do.

336
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And so when we try to, when we basically make those things God,

337
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 and we think that they're going to bring us wholeness, that they're going to make us feel okay,

338
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 we just end in heartbreak.

339
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Because we've been giving our heart to the wrong things.

340
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And so this Christmas is an invitation to give your heart to somebody who is truly special, which is Jesus.

341
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 So don't miss the good news of Christmas and receive the good news.

342
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Give your heart to Him.

343
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Now some of you might say, "Is this really good news? Is this really true?

344
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Is this guy just hyping all of this up?"

345
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Well, ultimately, you can only find out for yourself.

346
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 But I want to actually right now, I want to invite the worship team to come up.

347
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And you know, Jesus came because He loves you. He is for you.

348
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And He wants you to know His love. He wants you to know His care.

349
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 He wants you to know His peace. He wants to unfold wholeness, shalom, in your life.

350
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And He brought us about by dying on the cross for your sins.

351
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 So that you can be forgiven and that your relationship between you and God,

352
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 that is at odds, can be restored and you become part of God's family.

353
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 And so in just a moment, I'm going to pray for all of us.

354
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 But I actually want to invite everyone to stand right now.

355
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And I want to give an opportunity for those of you who've never given their hearts to Jesus,

356
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 to the one who is truly special.

357
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 I want to actually just give you an opportunity to do that.

358
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 To invite Jesus to come into your heart.

359
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 As I was preparing for this message, I was thinking of myself.

360
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 I became a Christian when I was a teenager.

361
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And I was struggling. There was anxiety. There was fear.

362
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 And there were sleepless nights for almost a year.

363
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And then in a conversation with my father, he's like, "Have you ever placed your trust in Jesus?"

364
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And really what that meant for me was just surrender.

365
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 I just surrendered to Jesus. Like, "Jesus, I can't do it.

366
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Will you come into my life? Will you do it?"

367
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 So I want to invite you right now, if you've never invited Jesus in your heart,

368
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 and if you want to express with yourself that, "Jesus, I want you. I need you."

369
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 You can just quietly, before you just stretch out your hands,

370
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 you can do it like very minimal, however you want to do it, it doesn't matter.

371
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 You can just express it.

372
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Say, "Jesus, I want you in my life. I need you in my life.

373
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 I want this peace. I want this relationship with you."

374
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 So you can do that right now.

375
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Let me pray for you. Let me pray for all of us.

376
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Jesus, I thank you for every hand stretched out.

377
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 I thank you that you are the true gift of Christmas, the true peace bringer.

378
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I pray right now that you come into everyone's life who has stretched out their hands,

379
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 who's saying, "Jesus, I need you. I want you."

380
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I pray that this will be the greatest Christmas,

381
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 that you will make yourself known, that you will reveal your love,

382
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 and that you will bring your peace, your shalom, your wholeness that only you can bring,

383
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 that you fill everyone with your Holy Spirit.

384
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus, for life's being turned to you right now.

385
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 We praise you.

386
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And thank you, Jesus, for everyone else here today.

387
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 You know everyone's journey. You know what their Christmas is like today.

388
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I pray that you would bring your love, your comfort, your peace, your presence.

389
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Will you show your presence that you are with us?

390
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 And as your presence breaks upon us, as we become aware of it,

391
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 may you fill our hearts with joy and fill our hearts with songs of praise

392
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 that you are the glorious Savior who loves us, who came, that's why he came.

393
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And so we want to praise you, Lord. So I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.

394
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,840
 Amen.
