1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 (audience chattering)

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,820
 Ah, great.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,740
 Who has plans for summer?

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,180
 Anyone got summer plans?

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,560
 Only Tim and maybe me.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,780
 All right, yeah, my family, they're already in Singapore,

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,020
 but I love you guys too much,

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,900
 so I decided to stay with you all.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,700
 (laughs)

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,660
 I do love you guys.

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,860
 And I would love to tell you a few things

12
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,580
 that's happening in church as well.

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,860
 So last week, just a praise report,

14
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,700
 we had our first ever Youth Ministry gathering last Sunday.

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,340
 And it was so fun, thanks to a lot of our volunteers,

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,840
 and it's been a great time.

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,980
 And we're gonna have the second one next week.

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,720
 So next Sunday, is it next week?

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,220
 Yes, next Sunday at 1.30 to 3.30.

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,740
 And I just want to tell you in advance,

21
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,420
 especially to our young people here,

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,420
 we do actually prepare lunch for you all.

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,240
 So I know some of you, last time you came after lunch,

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,820
 and we're so sorry, we just hope you come and join us

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,780
 for lunch, I'm talking to the young people here,

26
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,020
 by the way, yeah.

27
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,140
 And youth, according to Francesca last week,

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,220
 the definition of youth in this church,

29
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,620
 I know we're all very young, when I look around,

30
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,220
 you all are so young and energetic.

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,220
 But youth in our church means people who are

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,460
 in the age range of 13 to 18.

33
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,660
 I hope I got this right, 13 to 18, all right?

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,460
 I know all the ladies in this room are 18,

35
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,100
 I know that, I know that, okay.

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,100
 Maybe we have to set this a little bit lower then.

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,540
 Anyway, so if you have any young people around you,

38
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,780
 please scan this QR code, invite them,

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,700
 remind them we're providing lunch as well,

40
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,540
 so that's happening next week.

41
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,620
 And I'm gonna jump forward to September

42
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,100
 to tell you something exciting in advance.

43
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,100
 Our next baptism is happening at the end of September.

44
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,260
 So this is the date we have set for now.

45
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,140
 We may change it a little bit,

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,780
 but it should be around this time.

47
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,300
 And the baptism class will be on the 8th and the 15th.

48
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,700
 So we're telling you the dates in advance

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,260
 'cause we wanna invite especially those among us,

50
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,540
 if you have not been baptized, which we think you should be,

51
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,020
 because baptism audit means it's an outward symbol

52
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,180
 of something that is happening inside of you.

53
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,140
 If you follow Jesus in your heart,

54
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,740
 if you accept him as your Lord and Savior,

55
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,100
 then baptism is a way to tell the rest of the world,

56
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,700
 this is what you have chosen to do

57
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,380
 or to believe in your heart.

58
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,500
 So of course, there's so much more about baptism

59
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,940
 and about like what's about following Jesus

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,340
 that we would love to explain to you in the baptism class.

61
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,260
 And even if you're not sure whether you could get baptized

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,340
 for whatever reasons,

63
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,700
 we still would love to invite you to the baptism class

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,300
 if you haven't joined one before.

65
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,260
 You will learn so much more about baptism

66
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,020
 and faith and everything, and you can decide.

67
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,300
 And we do have people in the past,

68
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,220
 even they couldn't join the baptism for whatever reason,

69
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,740
 they came to the baptism class

70
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,660
 and we had a great time together, I think.

71
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,620
 So yeah, so sign up code here

72
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,060
 and we will keep reminding you

73
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,580
 so you have more time to think about it.

74
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,060
 Cool, and the next announcements,

75
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,820
 I wanna invite someone, one of my heroes up on the stage.

76
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,380
 These are the heroes that's always like

77
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,900
 work in the background.

78
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,580
 And can we give it up to Justin?

79
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,460
 He's gonna tell us a little bit about the production team.

80
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,300
 - Joseph, Joseph, good morning.

81
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,820
 If I'm one of your heroes, you need to look higher, man.

82
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,700
 All right, get some better role models.

83
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,820
 Yeah, I'm Justin,

84
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,020
 I'm in charge of the production team here at Vineyuan Long.

85
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,340
 And I don't know, some of you might be like,

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,260
 what is production?

87
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,260
 I know whenever I see the word producer,

88
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,420
 I'm like, that doesn't mean anything to me.

89
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,900
 It sounds vague and fancy.

90
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,860
 So that's why we have a list here.

91
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,580
 For production team, we're basically in charge

92
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,820
 of anything that's got electricity, a power cable,

93
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,940
 that's our job.

94
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,060
 So sound, slides, camera, lighting,

95
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,900
 everything that we need to make a service run smoothly

96
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,940
 and help you as a congregation,

97
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,900
 follow along with the scriptures or hear the sermon

98
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,940
 or watch it back on the recording.

99
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,660
 That's what we do.

100
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,420
 So we're always looking for more people

101
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,940
 to join the team and help.

102
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,020
 If any of that interests you

103
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,620
 and you feel relatively comfortable

104
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,980
 with technology in your life,

105
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,460
 please come talk to me or scan the code

106
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,580
 and you can fill out our interest form.

107
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,460
 And one perk is that you get to hang out

108
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,340
 in the very cool, what Pastor Tim calls the VIP room.

109
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,620
 It's a very cool vibe back there,

110
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,860
 especially if you're an introvert.

111
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,260
 So come join us, but not too many of you

112
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,380
 'cause then that defeats the whole purpose.

113
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,100
 But yeah, no, that's why we have scheduling.

114
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,220
 All right, please, yeah, if you are interested,

115
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,060
 come talk to me.

116
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,900
 Thank you very much.

117
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,860
 - Thank you, Justin.

118
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,700
 I remember there was one time

119
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,780
 I was preaching in the Cantonese service.

120
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,180
 I came in like before service, I guess 15 minutes,

121
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,220
 I have a very last minute request,

122
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,780
 a very high tech kind of last minute request.

123
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,540
 And I talked to Justin and all he said was,

124
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,820
 "That's why we're here."

125
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,340
 I think sometimes we forget how much effort

126
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,220
 has been put into the service.

127
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,020
 And I think if you really want to learn

128
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,740
 to serve like Jesus, like servant leadership,

129
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,340
 that's a fancy word, that is a very good place to start.

130
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,180
 Can we put our hands together for our whole production team

131
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,220
 and also our welcome team as well.

132
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,180
 They've been serving week in, week out

133
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,100
 and they've been amazing.

134
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,660
 And talking about the welcome team,

135
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,620
 they're standing there ready for offering already.

136
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,540
 So I'll just very spoofly

137
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,780
 segue into our offering time as well.

138
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,740
 And as a welcome team, they're passing on the buckets.

139
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,780
 If you gift by cash or checks,

140
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,580
 that's how you can put it inside the buckets

141
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,980
 with the envelopes.

142
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,900
 If you want to do it in all the digital fancy ways,

143
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,300
 all the QR codes are on the screen.

144
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,940
 We just want to thank you for partnering with us

145
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,060
 in this church.

146
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,060
 And you may be aware of the alphas that we've been running.

147
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,020
 And alpha season will be back soon again.

148
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,900
 We'll tell you more about it later.

149
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,540
 You may remember the parenting workshop seminars

150
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,740
 that we're hosting and all the other ministries.

151
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,100
 We're very grateful that a lot of you,

152
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,140
 you partner with us in many different ways.

153
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,260
 First of all, of course, it's through your prayer.

154
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,900
 And of course, a lot of you would come and volunteer

155
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,100
 in those events.

156
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,380
 And also a lot of you give quite sacrificially

157
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,540
 to make all these possible.

158
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,340
 We're still finding new ways to better serve

159
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,940
 our community here in Yuen Long.

160
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,060
 That's why God planted us here.

161
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,140
 We're still finding ways,

162
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,660
 but your partnership has always been crucial.

163
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,940
 And I just want to say thank you to all of you for that.

164
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,020
 And I would love to pray for our offering today as well.

165
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,660
 Would you bow your heads with me?

166
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,060
 God, we thank you for your blessings,

167
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,220
 not just on us, but also through us.

168
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,420
 We are amazed that as a group of people here,

169
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,500
 as your representative, your church,

170
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,340
 what we can actually do to bless those people around us,

171
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,140
 people who know you, people who have yet to know you.

172
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,140
 Father, you have given us resources,

173
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,820
 you have given us talents,

174
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,220
 you have given us many different ways

175
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,460
 to reach out to those around us.

176
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,780
 I pray that Lord God, that we will continue to journey

177
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,900
 with you, to walk with you as a church.

178
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,660
 We will continue to bring your blessings

179
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,420
 to this community around us in Yuen Long and to our city.

180
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,220
 And Father, I just want to thank you

181
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,820
 for every single one here in this room who give,

182
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,300
 who choose to partner, who choose to sow into your kingdom.

183
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,860
 I pray a blessing over them and their family.

184
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,820
 In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

185
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,700
 And I would love to invite our speaker today,

186
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,980
 Tim, back to the stage, Pastor Tim.

187
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,660
 It's good to have you with us today again.

188
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,900
 And yeah, so let's pray for him

189
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,860
 as he's going to bring this message to us today.

190
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,820
 Father, we pray for Pastor Tim,

191
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,860
 we pray you would anoint your servant,

192
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,660
 you would speak through him today.

193
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,940
 We pray as he unpacks your work, your word,

194
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,140
 and God, we pray that our hearts will be set on fire

195
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,420
 by this message.

196
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,020
 I know it has already set his heart on fire.

197
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,020
 So God, we just pray today you will come

198
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,540
 and speak to every single one of us in this room.

199
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,180
 In your name we pray.

200
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,060
 - Amen. - Amen.

201
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,220
 - Thank you, Chapman.

202
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,620
 Wow, it's so good to be with you, good to see you.

203
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,900
 Amazing to worship with you together.

204
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,420
 You know, the lyrics from the song,

205
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,380
 "You're Worthy of It All," like as Chapman did,

206
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,340
 you know, they're from the book of Revelations.

207
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,820
 And one thing that John in that book does,

208
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,820
 he gives heavenly scenes to encourage the saints.

209
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,780
 So there's, whenever the book of Revelation shifts,

210
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,180
 it's God revealing what's happening in the heavenly realm,

211
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,220
 and he encourages and builds up his people.

212
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,380
 And so I really, I don't know about you,

213
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,660
 but I was just so encouraged and built up,

214
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,900
 you know, through the worship,

215
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,160
 and I trust that you were as well.

216
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,660
 But hey, now this year, here at the Vineyard Long,

217
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,940
 we have been focusing on growing

218
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,060
 in our personal relationship with Jesus.

219
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,640
 One way that we have tried to do that

220
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,800
 is through the beginning of the year,

221
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,500
 we had a 21-day fasting season.

222
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,200
 So during the fasting time, we came before God,

223
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,500
 and we brought things where we were longing for breakthrough

224
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,500
 where we said, "Jesus, I need breakthrough from you

225
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,780
 in this area of my life."

226
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,140
 But it was not the only thing

227
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,540
 that we brought before Jesus' fasting season.

228
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,060
 It was also us making ourselves available.

229
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,740
 "Jesus, I'm here, I'm available, use me, use our church.

230
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,820
 We know that what you wanna do,

231
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,860
 we're not able to do out of our own strength,

232
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,060
 out of our own power, but it's by the power of your spirit."

233
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,700
 And it was a yielding and a surrendering.

234
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,180
 And then with that fasting season

235
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,660
 that we had at the beginning of the year,

236
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,660
 21 days of fasting, we also had a sermon series

237
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,300
 that we titled "Fresh Encounters."

238
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,660
 And so part of that series was about that

239
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,260
 we as Christians, a lot of times,

240
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,380
 get into spiritual routines.

241
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,820
 Now routine is nothing bad, actually they're very helpful,

242
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,300
 but sometimes our routines get stale,

243
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,700
 where we just do the same old, same old,

244
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,220
 and our spiritual life somehow loses its dynamic.

245
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,060
 And so in the series, we were talking about

246
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,420
 how we wanna have fresh encounters with Jesus,

247
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,420
 how we wanna have new encounters,

248
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,540
 not just always talk about the past,

249
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,980
 but Jesus meeting us here in the present,

250
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,700
 speaking to us in the present,

251
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,660
 doing new things in our lives.

252
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,620
 So for those of you who were here

253
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,780
 at the beginning of the year, I'm just curious,

254
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,100
 how is that going?

255
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,580
 How has that been going?

256
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:23,300
 Now for me, one of the things that I do,

257
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,660
 one of my own spiritual practices,

258
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,660
 is I ask myself every week a series of questions

259
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,580
 that I then answer by journaling.

260
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,140
 And so these are questions about my work,

261
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,460
 these are questions about my personal life,

262
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,100
 how I'm doing spiritually.

263
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,940
 And so because of this theme this year,

264
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,620
 at the beginning of the year,

265
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,420
 I added a question to these questions that I ask myself.

266
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,060
 And it's this question,

267
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,020
 have I spent quality time with Jesus this week?

268
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,500
 Now for me, quality time with Jesus

269
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,060
 means spending time in prayer,

270
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,620
 spending time in God's word,

271
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,020
 journaling, meditating on God's word,

272
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,300
 just having time to listen, to sit still,

273
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,380
 to sit in the presence of God.

274
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,340
 And it's also important that I'm not doing that

275
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,020
 because of work.

276
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,620
 'Cause as you know, I write sermons

277
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,860
 and I go in God's word prayerfully and I do these things.

278
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,900
 But in this time, it's important

279
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,180
 that I just go with no agenda,

280
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,420
 or just go personally,

281
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,420
 not because I'm trying to write a sermon or something.

282
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,500
 And I found that when I have this intimacy with Jesus,

283
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,900
 when I actually take time, and I don't always,

284
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,100
 I'm confessing here as a pastor,

285
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,820
 but that's why I ask myself those questions

286
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,620
 because I wanna be on the right track.

287
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,820
 I wanna have that intimacy.

288
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,540
 I wanna hear from Jesus in my life.

289
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,020
 And so that's why I ask myself this question,

290
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,860
 when I don't have this time,

291
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,180
 when just suddenly my life spins out of control,

292
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,860
 I get busy, I do all sorts of things,

293
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,620
 I lose a lot of times perspective,

294
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,180
 I lose hope sometimes or joy,

295
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,180
 and I get out of touch with actually what God

296
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,660
 is saying to me or speaking to us as a family,

297
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,140
 and even us as a church.

298
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,260
 Now, King David,

299
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,180
 pondering the significance of God's word,

300
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,060
 he said this in Psalm 119, 105, famous verse,

301
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,620
 "Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path."

302
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,460
 So God's word is the primary way

303
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,420
 that God makes himself known to us.

304
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,500
 So he reveals himself to us personally

305
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,580
 so that we can personally know him.

306
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,700
 But on top of that, God's word also gives us guidance,

307
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,060
 in where he speaks about us,

308
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,020
 about situations and circumstances in our lives,

309
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,180
 where he gives us direction and clarity,

310
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,580
 what it means to follow him in this particular circumstance

311
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,460
 that you are facing right now.

312
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,140
 And so that is why I asked myself this question,

313
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,620
 because I wanna hear from God, I wanna encounter God,

314
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,860
 and I need him to speak into all sorts of circumstances.

315
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,220
 And so I asked myself the question,

316
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,460
 have I spent quality time with Jesus this week?

317
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,700
 'Cause I wanna make sure that I hear from him,

318
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,140
 that I hear from the voice of God,

319
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,140
 that I hear him speak to me,

320
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,780
 that I don't just act out of what Tim thinks,

321
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,900
 but that I'm hearing from him personally.

322
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,220
 So today through this message,

323
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,460
 what I wanna explore with you,

324
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,900
 or just a question that I really wanna put before you,

325
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,380
 and I believe this is also the question

326
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,100
 that the biblical text that we're gonna look at

327
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,780
 puts before us is,

328
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,660
 are we listening to God speak to us through his word?

329
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,620
 Like, do we actually make space in our calendars

330
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,460
 and our lives to hear from God,

331
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,100
 the creator of the universe,

332
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,020
 who has amazing things to say to us, to you,

333
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:13,380
 who when he speaks, he brings about good things,

334
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,420
 he wants to bring about good things,

335
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,860
 he wants to bring about flourishing in your life.

336
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,420
 He wants them to unfold, but do we listen?

337
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,140
 Do we give God space in our lives to speak?

338
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,060
 Or do we listen to a bunch of other things, but not to God?

339
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:36,220
 Well, we're continuing in our Galatians sermon series,

340
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,020
 and Paul basically asks this question to the Galatians,

341
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,700
 are you listening to God's word speak to you

342
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,460
 about the current circumstances,

343
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,980
 the challenges that they are facing?

344
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,140
 And so I wanna look with you at that,

345
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,020
 but before that, I wanna set the context for our passage,

346
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,740
 because Paul takes the Galatians

347
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,300
 to what we call the Old Testament,

348
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,420
 or we could call Hebrew scriptures in this case,

349
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,940
 he takes them to a story in Genesis.

350
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,780
 And so I wanna retell the story

351
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,500
 because Paul assumes that his listeners know it,

352
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,580
 and so he doesn't explain everything

353
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,900
 as he speaks to them about listening

354
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,260
 to the voice of God through scripture.

355
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,220
 And so let me set the context.

356
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,540
 So it's a story about Abraham.

357
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,340
 Now, God promised Abraham that he will bless him,

358
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,180
 that we will make him into a great nation,

359
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,540
 that all people on earth will be blessed through him,

360
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,620
 that we will give him land,

361
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,220
 so there's all these promises that God makes Abraham,

362
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,420
 but there is a problem.

363
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,260
 The problem is, or there's tension in the story,

364
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,060
 because Sarah, his wife,

365
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,860
 she has not been able to conceive any children.

366
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,380
 So right from the get-go, there's this question,

367
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,460
 how is this gonna work if you talk about

368
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,260
 numerous descendants and all of this?

369
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,180
 How is this gonna happen?

370
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,180
 Now, so Abraham and Sarah, they wait,

371
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,940
 and they wait on God, they wait on God's promise,

372
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,420
 but nothing seems to happen.

373
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,780
 So Sarah approaches Abraham,

374
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,940
 and they take matters into their own hands.

375
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:17,900
 Sarah gives her servant Hagar to Abraham in marriage.

376
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,620
 So this was a common practice among wealthy families

377
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,540
 where they would do that,

378
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,260
 and if there's a child born,

379
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,860
 that then can become the heir of the family.

380
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,300
 So they do that, and Hagar gives birth to a child

381
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,900
 named Ishmael.

382
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,820
 Now, God speaks to Abraham again,

383
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,340
 and this time he makes a covenant.

384
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,420
 So he doesn't just make the promise,

385
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,580
 but he actually ratifies that in a covenant

386
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,420
 with Abraham.

387
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,940
 But he says that the promises that he's making to him,

388
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,340
 that they will be fulfilled through a child

389
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,820
 that Sarah will give birth to.

390
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,180
 So again, she is, the Bible says she's barren.

391
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,020
 She's not able to bear children,

392
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,180
 but it also says now that she's way beyond the age

393
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,380
 where women usually give birth.

394
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,540
 And so God wants them, but God promises this,

395
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,620
 and then within a year, Sarah is pregnant.

396
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,980
 She gives birth to Isaac.

397
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,820
 It's a miracle.

398
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,740
 It's unbelievable.

399
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,740
 God has fulfilled his promise.

400
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,700
 Now, Isaac and Ishmael, they grow up,

401
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,580
 and Ishmael, he mocks Isaac.

402
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,660
 And so this then triggers some tension

403
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,140
 between Hagar and Sarah,

404
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,900
 and Sarah then ultimately asks Abraham

405
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,700
 for Ishmael to be kicked out,

406
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
 her and Hagar out of, away from the family.

407
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
 And Abraham agrees.

408
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,540
 He talks to God.

409
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,180
 God says, "I will take care of them."

410
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,380
 And so then they send them away.

411
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,460
 So that's the background of the biblical text

412
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,020
 that we're gonna look at, the background story.

413
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,340
 So you can keep that in mind as we read that.

414
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:09,340
 So let's go to Galatians 4, and starting with verse 21,

415
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,100
 it says this.

416
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,380
 "Tell me, you who want to be under the law,

417
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,700
 are you not aware of what the law says?

418
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,220
 For it is written that Abraham had two sons,

419
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,540
 one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.

420
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,580
 His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh,

421
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,580
 but his son by the free woman was born

422
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,100
 as a result of divine promise."

423
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,220
 So Paul addresses the Galatians in verse 21

424
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,860
 with the phrase, "As those who want to be under the law."

425
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,820
 Now, this is interesting.

426
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,900
 So again, are they gonna submit themselves to Mosaic law?

427
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:53,780
 And, you know, for Paul, this would be something negative,

428
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,780
 but for this group of agitators or Judaizers

429
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,820
 or rival missionaries,

430
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,220
 those are three different names we've given them,

431
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,020
 from that group that came into Galatia

432
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,460
 and stirred things up and challenged what Paul had preached.

433
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,820
 So they would see that as something positive

434
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,540
 and would see that as the way

435
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,380
 of becoming part of God's family.

436
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,740
 But for Paul, he says,

437
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,460
 "No, that's not the way you become part of God's family,

438
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,060
 not through observing law, not through human effort,

439
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,100
 but through faith in Jesus, by the power of God,

440
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,020
 by the Spirit's work."

441
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,460
 So that's how they would view that.

442
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,740
 Now, Paul then asks the second, or as he continues to say,

443
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,460
 "Are you not aware of what the law says?"

444
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,060
 You know, you who want to be under the law,

445
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,620
 are you not aware of what the law says?

446
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,500
 Now, a more literal translation of this would be,

447
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,140
 "Do you not listen to the law?"

448
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,420
 Now, Paul uses the word law.

449
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,380
 Actually, law was shorthand in the time

450
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,380
 for all of the Hebrew scripture.

451
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,620
 So Paul is saying, "Do you not listen to God's word?"

452
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,460
 Now, during that time,

453
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,740
 people didn't have their apps on the phone

454
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,540
 or their private Bibles.

455
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,420
 Actually, the written word was something that was really rare,

456
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,700
 really expensive, really precious.

457
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,580
 So they had either the Hebrew scripture

458
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,820
 or the Greek version, which is called the Septuagint.

459
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,860
 They had it on parchment, so like animal skin,

460
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,700
 or they had it on papyrus rolls.

461
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,420
 And so the way that most people encountered God's word

462
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,260
 was simply by hearing, because it was read, it was recited,

463
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,140
 sometimes it was recited by memory.

464
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,380
 And so that's how they would hear God's word.

465
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,780
 But Paul is not just saying to them,

466
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,380
 "Are you listening to God's word?"

467
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,660
 Or, "Do you listen to what the law actually says?"

468
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,900
 He's saying, "Are you listening to what is God saying

469
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,740
 "through his word about your current circumstances?"

470
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,220
 Yeah, are you actually really hearing from God

471
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,140
 what he is saying through his word

472
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,660
 to you about your life right now, right here?

473
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,540
 So that's what's going on there.

474
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,580
 So here we can see that the truth,

475
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,980
 that God loves to speak to us through his word,

476
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,860
 providing guidance, clarity, and direction for us

477
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,880
 in our current life circumstances.

478
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,500
 And so God was speaking to the Galatians,

479
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,460
 but again, there was a question, are they listening?

480
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,420
 Are they hearing?

481
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,220
 Are they tuned, and do they desire to hear from God?

482
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,860
 And Paul is asking that question.

483
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,060
 And this actually has a lot of relevance for us today,

484
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,100
 because God still speaks us through his word.

485
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,940
 He still speaks us about our current circumstances

486
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,460
 through his word.

487
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,380
 And not just, are you listening to it, are you studying it,

488
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,060
 but are you hearing God speak to you

489
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,020
 about what is happening in your life?

490
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,620
 Maybe it's about relationships.

491
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,340
 Maybe it's about raising children.

492
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,780
 Maybe it's about justice issues.

493
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,500
 Maybe it's about COVID-19.

494
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,020
 So any of these things, God's word through his spirit,

495
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,940
 he speaks to his people so that we know,

496
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,460
 what does it mean to follow Jesus?

497
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,160
 How should we think about this?

498
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,660
 What's God's will for the situation?

499
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,180
 And he loves speaking to his people.

500
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,940
 But again, the question is, are we listening?

501
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,300
 Do we even hear, or have we learned to hear

502
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,460
 how God speaks to us and what he's saying?

503
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,460
 So Paul then goes on,

504
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,060
 and he actually then takes the Galatians to God's word.

505
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,560
 So this is where verse 22 and 23,

506
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,660
 where it talks about, says,

507
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,900
 for it is written that Abram had two sons,

508
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,420
 one by the slave woman, the other by a free woman.

509
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,340
 His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh,

510
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,260
 but a son by the free woman was born

511
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,700
 as a result of a divine promise.

512
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,700
 So the phrase, it was written,

513
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,660
 is Paul's shorthand for whenever he introduces scripture.

514
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,340
 So usually it's a direct quotation from the Bible.

515
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,840
 In this case, it's a summary

516
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,560
 of what the Hagar-Sara narrative says in the Bible.

517
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,260
 So he's saying, I'm taking you now to God's word.

518
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:11,320
 And he basically summarizes the story

519
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,400
 in the following way, where he creates this contrast

520
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,800
 between the son born to a slave,

521
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,120
 and the son born to a free woman,

522
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,160
 and the son born according to the flesh,

523
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,600
 and the son born as a result of God's promise.

524
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,720
 So we have a table for that.

525
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,400
 Let me show what that looks like.

526
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,520
 So what Paul is doing here,

527
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,800
 he's showing the contrast between these two things.

528
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,640
 And I wanna especially highlight the contrast

529
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,400
 between born of the flesh and born as a result

530
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,900
 of God's promise.

531
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:50,480
 And so this is the part where Sara and Abraham,

532
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,200
 they were trying out of their own strength

533
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,400
 to make things happen, by their own power.

534
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,920
 And that's why they asked Hagar to have a,

535
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,760
 you know, to get married to Abraham, have a child.

536
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,960
 And he says that that was according to the flesh,

537
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,820
 it was out of the human strength, not by God's strength.

538
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,680
 But then in contrast, when Sara gave birth to Isaac,

539
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,200
 it is by the power of the spirit

540
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,440
 that this miracle really happens,

541
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,680
 that Isaac is born,

542
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,900
 and it's according to the promise that God made.

543
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,760
 Now this is interesting,

544
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
 and I think this is something

545
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,980
 that we probably can all relate to,

546
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,280
 that there's many times in our lives

547
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,160
 where we try to do something out of our human strength.

548
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,240
 We try to make something happen.

549
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,160
 Maybe God spoke to you about something.

550
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,480
 He's gonna do something in your life,

551
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,860
 and you're waiting and you're waiting,

552
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,760
 you get tired of waiting,

553
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,320
 and you're like, I'm just gonna now try it

554
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,840
 on my own effort to make this happen.

555
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,060
 And so we go for it.

556
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,000
 Now I can relate to that, I've done that.

557
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,040
 I remember, so I've shared before where my life

558
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,720
 at that point in time in many ways fell apart,

559
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,600
 broken relationship, loss of job, loss of home,

560
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,200
 all of those things.

561
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,520
 And so in that time, God met me and spoke to me,

562
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,600
 and it was helpful, and I started moving forward.

563
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,760
 But there was this point where it was like,

564
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,000
 I want things to be right again.

565
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,840
 And I wanna see that happening.

566
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,120
 So I was striving really hard,

567
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,520
 I was trying really hard to bring about these things

568
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,000
 in my life that I can experience wholeness,

569
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,120
 that I can figure out what I'm doing job wise.

570
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,320
 And I was trying as hard as I could,

571
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,480
 and it was actually creating a lot of anxiety,

572
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,920
 and also not much was happening.

573
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,300
 And so then during one time, spending time in God's word,

574
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:41,360
 he spoke to me through a passage where he told me

575
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,700
 that he will establish me in his time.

576
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,160
 And so this was a promise.

577
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,200
 And then basically, for me then,

578
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,960
 I was actually was really helpful

579
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,240
 because I was trying so hard, I was striving,

580
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,040
 and I just realized I just need to trust

581
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,440
 and have faith in God that he will meet me,

582
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,120
 especially now that he's spoken,

583
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,980
 that he will meet me, that he will establish me,

584
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,960
 that he will sort things out in my life,

585
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,360
 even though right now it's a big mess,

586
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,240
 and I don't know what to do,

587
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,800
 and I'm just trying to set things right myself.

588
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,200
 And so that removed a lot of the anxiety and stress for me

589
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,760
 as I started trusting God,

590
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,720
 that he will fulfill what he says by his power,

591
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,480
 by his spirit, not by my effort.

592
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,600
 But so here we see these two lines.

593
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,080
 One is the path of works,

594
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,000
 the other one is the path of grace and the power of God.

595
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,540
 And so Paul is laying this before the Galatians.

596
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,500
 But let's continue in verse 24.

597
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,720
 It says this, "These things are being taken figuratively.

598
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,400
 "The woman represents two covenants.

599
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,320
 "One covenant is from Mount Sinai

600
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,960
 "and bears children who are to be slaves, that is Hagar.

601
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,960
 "Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia

602
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,440
 "and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem,

603
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,000
 "because she is in slavery with her children.

604
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,960
 "But the Jerusalem that is above is free,

605
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,260
 "and she is our mother.

606
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,540
 "For it is written, 'Be glad, barren woman,

607
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,100
 "'you who never bore a child,

608
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,440
 "'break forth and cry aloud,

609
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,120
 "'you who were never in labor,

610
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,920
 "'because more are the children

611
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,520
 "'of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.'"

612
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,320
 So here Paul, I notice this very complicated, this text,

613
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,640
 but Paul is basically moving from,

614
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,840
 first he summarized scripture theologically,

615
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,400
 now he's saying I'm interpreting this figuratively for you.

616
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,600
 And I'm showing how this applies

617
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,740
 to your life, to your circumstances.

618
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,800
 And he's drawing this comparison

619
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,160
 between these two lineages, again,

620
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,880
 and just further develops that.

621
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,920
 So let's visualize that, let's put that up.

622
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,440
 So here you have the path of works continues,

623
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,600
 it's the Mosaic Covenant, he talks about two covenants.

624
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,600
 It's Hagar, Mount Sinai, slavery, present Jerusalem.

625
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,980
 So that's the one lineage, then you have the other one,

626
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,360
 it's the new covenant, it's our mother,

627
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,780
 probably implies Mount Sinai, but it's not clear,

628
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,400
 so I didn't put that in, freedom, Jerusalem.

629
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,880
 So again, God lays before his people

630
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,440
 these two different tracks, two different paths,

631
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,200
 the paths of work, the path of grace.

632
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,860
 And the one leads to enslavement,

633
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,240
 you know, this leads to enslavement,

634
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,240
 and this leads to life, freedom, relationship with God.

635
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,500
 Now, Paul also, and I'm gonna keep this short on this part,

636
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,040
 Paul also really brings it into the present

637
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,600
 when he talks about present Jerusalem

638
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,740
 and the Jerusalem that is above, so let me explain that.

639
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,960
 So the present Jerusalem, you know,

640
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,320
 refers to all those who are under the Mosaic law,

641
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,740
 who are seeking, now that crisis come,

642
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,040
 who are seeking to earn right standing, you know,

643
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,560
 with God through observing the law,

644
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,760
 to be in a part of the family of God,

645
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,200
 and then they're putting forth these human efforts,

646
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,200
 so that's this track, and then the Jerusalem that is above

647
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,760
 are people who have placed their faith in Jesus,

648
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,900
 who have been born again, born by the Spirit,

649
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,600
 who are now a new creation, where God has done something new,

650
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,720
 where have, like, this new creation

651
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,560
 is breaking into our present age,

652
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,920
 and so this is where, it's a spiritual reality,

653
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,040
 the Jerusalem that is above.

654
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,760
 And so Paul takes the story and he puts this before him,

655
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,520
 these are the two tracks, these are the two pathways,

656
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,200
 and then he draws an application,

657
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,960
 and this is the last part of the scripture

658
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,440
 that we're gonna look at, so continue verse 28 says,

659
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,520
 now you brothers and sisters,

660
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,280
 like Isaac, are children of promise.

661
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,220
 At that time, the Son, born according to the flesh,

662
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,160
 persecuted the Son born by the power of the Spirit.

663
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,040
 It is the same now, but what does scripture say?

664
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,400
 Get rid of the slave woman and her son,

665
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,280
 for the slave woman's son will never share

666
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,120
 in the inheritance with the free woman's son.

667
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,840
 Therefore, brothers and sisters,

668
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,980
 we are not children of a slave woman,

669
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,880
 but of the free woman.

670
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,880
 So Paul has taken the Galatians to the scripture passage,

671
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,760
 he's saying God is speaking through this passage to them

672
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,200
 about their present circumstances,

673
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,280
 and he's holding before them these two pathways,

674
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,720
 how, and now he's, basically there's two applications.

675
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,760
 One of them, he tells the Galatians, Christians,

676
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,440
 that they are children of the promise,

677
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,360
 and children of the free woman.

678
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,760
 So he tells them their identity.

679
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,760
 It's like, you are part of God's promise being fulfilled.

680
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,000
 You are part, you are born of the Spirit, you are free.

681
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,080
 That is who you are.

682
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,760
 Why would you go back under the law?

683
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,460
 So that's basically what he's saying there.

684
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,600
 And this is by God's power, not by our own strength.

685
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,680
 And then the second thing that Paul says is,

686
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:22,480
 get rid of, you need to get rid of the agitators

687
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,400
 that are among you, that have been stirring things up,

688
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,720
 that have been undermining the truth of the gospel.

689
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
 And so he's talking about that basically

690
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,680
 they've been persecuting them or harassing them.

691
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,000
 He's saying you need to cut them off.

692
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,960
 You need to cut yourself off from them.

693
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,000
 And so that is what God is saying to the Galatians.

694
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,400
 This is who you are,

695
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,600
 and this is how you respond to the situation.

696
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,600
 Now, this, to us,

697
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,400
 it's not easy to take in, but you have to think about.

698
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,000
 So God is speaking to his people.

699
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,360
 He's speaking to them about something

700
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,960
 that they are really wrestling with,

701
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,600
 you know, that really has caused

702
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,400
 all these problems among them.

703
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,600
 And now God speaks and he gives them clarity

704
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,240
 through his word, you know, how they can move forward,

705
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,680
 how they can understand the situation.

706
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,560
 And he does that because he wants to bring life.

707
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,320
 He wants to see this life of the Spirit,

708
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,560
 this life that God wants to unfold among them.

709
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,920
 He wants to see that unfold.

710
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,840
 And so he's speaking, but the question is,

711
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,080
 are they listening?

712
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,600
 You know, are they hearing from God?

713
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,800
 Now I want to talk about us.

714
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,800
 I want to bring this to a more practical level.

715
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,040
 You know, are we listening to God speak to us

716
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,120
 through his word?

717
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,760
 So the, you know, Hagar and Sarah narrative

718
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,160
 or the Abraham story with the two sons,

719
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,180
 that was not written to the Galatians.

720
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,340
 That was written to a different group of people

721
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,940
 in Israel's history, but it did apply

722
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,940
 to the present circumstances they were facing in Galatia.

723
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,460
 And so the Bible is not written to us,

724
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,460
 but it is written for us.

725
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,580
 Now, what does this mean?

726
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,940
 It means that God's, you know, God's word,

727
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,940
 the Bible was written to people

728
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,060
 at a specific time in history

729
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:26,060
 with a specific purpose and a specific cultural context.

730
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,420
 And so in that sense, it's not written to us,

731
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,180
 but God's word is God breathed.

732
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,660
 So it's written for us.

733
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,820
 God speaks to us, even despite,

734
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,340
 and here, I think in this passage,

735
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,020
 we do see that there is a cultural gap, you know,

736
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,420
 between what's discussed in our own life,

737
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,580
 but it is God's word and he speaks to us

738
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,100
 through his word because it's God breathed.

739
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,580
 He speaks to his people.

740
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,420
 Now, of course, we can learn skills

741
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,020
 on how to interpret it, you know, a little bit better,

742
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,300
 but the important thing is that God loves speaking

743
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,980
 to his people and he helps us with the Holy Spirit

744
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
 to understand what his word says

745
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,420
 and how that word applies, you know, to us specifically.

746
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,780
 Now, a lot of times when we read God's word,

747
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,660
 we read it like we've learned how to read.

748
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,500
 So in school, we learn to read in a way

749
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,460
 that we gather information so that we can write the essay

750
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,060
 or that we can answer the questions.

751
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,020
 We read very informationally,

752
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,620
 or maybe if you're in business,

753
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,780
 maybe you read your financial reports, you study it,

754
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,620
 and then you gather all the key information,

755
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,200
 and that's how you get all the facts.

756
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,380
 But if you wanna hear God speak through his word,

757
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,500
 we have to move beyond just reading it

758
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,420
 in this informational way.

759
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,940
 We need to read it relationally.

760
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,380
 We need to read it prayerfully.

761
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,380
 And so reading the Bible prayerfully

762
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,980
 helps us to prepare ourselves to hear from God.

763
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,700
 You know, Lord, help me understand what I'm reading here.

764
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,340
 Speak to me, I'm here, your servant's listening.

765
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,300
 It's quite a different posture than when I go,

766
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,180
 okay, this is like homework, you know,

767
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,980
 okay, here are the facts of the story.

768
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,220
 Quite different.

769
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,180
 And as we read God's word prayerfully,

770
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,820
 you know, God speaks to his people.

771
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,260
 He will speak to you.

772
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,020
 He will speak to us as a community,

773
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,420
 but he also will speak to you individually.

774
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,900
 By speaking, I don't mean an audible voice,

775
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,820
 but I mean, you know, inside your heart, inside your mind,

776
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,660
 God will reveal things and make things clear to you

777
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,820
 that were not clear before,

778
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,740
 and you will know that it's not from you,

779
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,020
 but it is something that God is saying to you.

780
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,740
 So God loves to make himself known.

781
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,340
 He loves to speak to us.

782
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,340
 Now, as Christians,

783
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,620
 one thing that I think is important for us,

784
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,220
 we wanna bring what's going on in our lives

785
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,100
 and what's happening in our circumstance.

786
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,340
 So not just with us individually,

787
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,540
 but what's happening in our city,

788
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,020
 what's happening in Yuen Long,

789
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,700
 what's happening with people experiencing poverty.

790
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,660
 And we wanna bring those things prayerfully

791
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
 in dialogue with God's word,

792
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,540
 so that he speaks to us about these current circumstances,

793
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,940
 gives us wisdom about how he is calling us,

794
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,580
 leading us to move forward in those specific things.

795
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,780
 And I wanna give an example personally.

796
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,820
 Quite a while, actually, probably like 10 years ago,

797
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,900
 so I had a horrible conflict, preached about it before,

798
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,900
 where I just afterwards was exhausted,

799
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,140
 tired, really struggling to forgive.

800
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:41,420
 I mean, I even was like, almost like shaking

801
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:46,420
 and just like really knocked down flat from this conflict.

802
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,100
 And I really was struggling to forgive.

803
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,580
 I was like, I don't know how to forgive.

804
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,580
 And so this struggle led me to go back to God's word.

805
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,660
 And so what I find interesting,

806
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,900
 now that I've studied this before,

807
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,060
 and so I had certain answers about what forgiveness is,

808
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,780
 what reconciliation is,

809
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,660
 but now in this desperate situation

810
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,420
 with a specific conflict,

811
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,220
 where I really just could not move past it.

812
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,460
 As I was searching scripture,

813
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,540
 and this was also, by the way,

814
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,500
 not like one time I turned to the Bible

815
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,540
 and then everything was clear.

816
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,260
 This was an ongoing process.

817
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,140
 But God really spoke to me about what forgiveness is,

818
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,180
 what reconciliation is.

819
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:34,180
 And I realized that I had confused these concepts.

820
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,280
 So I thought forgiving means reconciling,

821
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,340
 so working things out

822
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,100
 and having the relationship reestablished.

823
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,300
 But actually forgiving is just forgiving

824
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,700
 and letting go of the offense of that person.

825
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,980
 And God's word says, we forgive,

826
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,420
 we're actually commanded to forgive.

827
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,080
 So forgiveness is a command,

828
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,260
 while reconciliation is a ministry.

829
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,860
 So reconciliation is something that we can only do

830
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,300
 if the other person is also maybe repentant

831
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,220
 of what they have done,

832
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,580
 if they're willing to engage in a process.

833
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,100
 So reconciliation takes two people.

834
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,020
 So for me, as I was wrestling with this conflict

835
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,940
 and God was bringing this clarity,

836
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,820
 I had clarity now on how I could follow Jesus

837
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,640
 in this conflict.

838
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,220
 He was asking me to forgive, which was struggling with,

839
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,820
 and then I prayerfully wrestled with that

840
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,540
 and God helped me to forgive.

841
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,060
 But I also realized that reconciliation,

842
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,780
 just going back to the relationship and how things were,

843
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,220
 was not something that I could just bring about

844
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,140
 out of my own.

845
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,940
 It also involved the other person,

846
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,380
 and it even involved them doing things

847
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,500
 that I cannot control.

848
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,780
 And so that was so helpful and so powerful to me.

849
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,900
 Another example, if you think more about,

850
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,500
 for us as a church during the pandemic,

851
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,980
 a lot of churches were asking,

852
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,980
 what is God saying to us during COVID?

853
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:00,440
 Where people are experiencing fear, anxiety, isolation,

854
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,300
 maybe sometimes feel really even labeled,

855
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,180
 if you had COVID and everybody treated you

856
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,980
 like you either have a horrible disease

857
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,740
 and nobody wants to get anywhere near to you,

858
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,940
 it's like dropping a food, running away as fast as they can

859
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,500
 without you opening the door and all of that stuff.

860
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,340
 And churches around the world did that.

861
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,500
 And so one thing that God spoke to us

862
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,700
 at the Vine very clearly about is the importance

863
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,580
 of community and relationships and community groups

864
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,580
 and that we need to tend and invest in and spend time

865
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,020
 caring for one another and checking in with one another.

866
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,620
 So God was speaking to his people

867
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,460
 on how to engage in that time.

868
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:50,660
 So I wanna invite the worship team to come up.

869
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:56,100
 And as I was preparing for this message,

870
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,180
 what I sensed was that God is just really putting

871
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,820
 this question before us.

872
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:07,140
 Are you listening to him speak?

873
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,300
 Are you giving space for God to speak to you

874
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,060
 through his word?

875
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:17,060
 Do you look to God's word for guidance in your life?

876
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,380
 Is God's word, does God's word have authority

877
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,380
 over your life?

878
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,300
 Where you place yourself, it's like, this is what God says.

879
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,500
 And even though maybe this maybe seems hard,

880
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,180
 because it's what God says, it is, I'm gonna do it.

881
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,460
 'Cause I know that ultimately what God's word says

882
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,220
 is the best thing and it gives life.

883
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,860
 And are we obedient when God speaks?

884
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,620
 And are we carving out a space?

885
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,580
 Because it's incredible that God speaks to us.

886
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,420
 That he wants to speak to you about the circumstances,

887
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,980
 the challenges that you are facing

888
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,500
 even right here and right now.

889
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,300
 And I know we are.

890
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,180
 I know many of us are.

891
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,700
 But are we opening our hearts, our lives to God

892
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,980
 to speak into our lives?

893
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,620
 Or are there other things speaking into our life?

894
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,460
 And I just felt that God just wants to light a fire

895
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,580
 in our hearts and give us this desire

896
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,060
 where he say, Jesus, I wanna hear from you.

897
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,780
 I wanna know what it means to follow you

898
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,180
 in this circumstance, at this point in time.

899
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,500
 I don't know what to do.

900
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,940
 I wanna hear from you.

901
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,780
 Or Jesus, how should I think about?

902
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,940
 I don't know how to think about this.

903
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,100
 Lord, help me to give a way

904
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,900
 of how I can think about this in the right way.

905
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,500
 I wanna hear from you.

906
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,820
 I wanna honor you.

907
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,300
 I wanna surrender to you and do things your way,

908
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,420
 not my way.

909
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,780
 So I just wanna invite everyone to stand.

910
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:59,580
 And I don't know if you have time

911
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,260
 or something scheduled in your calendar

912
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,380
 where you actually spend time with God.

913
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,500
 You know, there's actually a time in there

914
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,100
 where you carve out time to hear from Jesus.

915
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,700
 But I just would love to pray over us.

916
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:21,140
 And if you, yeah, just wanna express to Jesus,

917
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,940
 like, Jesus, I wanna hear from you.

918
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,300
 Or maybe it's even a specific thing

919
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,820
 that you need to hear from him about.

920
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,220
 I wanna encourage you to stretch out your hands.

921
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,940
 Let me pray for you.

922
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,140
 Jesus, I thank you so much

923
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,940
 that you are the God who speaks,

924
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,420
 that we can know your voice,

925
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,500
 that we can hear from you.

926
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,140
 And we don't know what to do,

927
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,500
 but you do.

928
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,060
 And you have a way forward.

929
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,380
 You have a perspective that we often lack and don't have.

930
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,940
 And Lord, I wanna pray for you.

931
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,620
 And Lord, you know all the circumstance

932
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,460
 that people are facing

933
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,060
 where they need to hear from you, Lord.

934
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,340
 I pray that you would speak.

935
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:12,060
 I pray that you would help to reprioritize

936
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,260
 just giving you time where you just come

937
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,500
 and just say, Jesus, I'm here.

938
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,260
 Speak to me.

939
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,820
 Speak into my life.

940
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,860
 Show me your heart.

941
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,460
 (gentle music)

942
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:35,500
 So Lord, yeah, I pray that we would be a church

943
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,780
 where you are at the center of our lives,

944
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,860
 where we know what you are saying to us.

945
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,620
 When we ask each other, what's God saying to you?

946
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,180
 That we know what you're speaking to us.

947
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,820
 And I pray that we can encourage each other

948
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,820
 to just always keep coming back to your word,

949
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,180
 to hear from you.

950
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:01,260
 And so will you do this work among us?

951
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,500
 Will you speak to us?

952
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,700
 Will you speak to those of us who are struggling?

953
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,140
 Will you give a word, Lord?

954
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,980
 We desperately long for it and we thank you for it.

955
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,500
 I pray this in your name, Jesus, amen.

956
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,860
