1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
 - Amen.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,960
 Amen.

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,960
 Hey, can we thank our worship team as always.

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,280
 Have a seat, have a seat.

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,800
 Well, after about 400 weeks of this series,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,920
 well, not quite that bad.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,800
 After though, 400 years of Israel being in Egypt,

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,360
 and after about roughly 200 of those years,

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,680
 them being in slavery in Egypt,

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,640
 and after 10 devastating plagues

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,880
 that have built up and built up upon themselves,

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,660
 Pharaoh's heart is finally softened,

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,640
 and he finally decides to let Israel go,

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,140
 to let Israel move into the freedom

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,000
 that God has from his compassion

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,540
 from chapter two onwards longed for them to have.

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,440
 And after those 400 years of being in Egypt,

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,200
 those 200 years of being in slavery,

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
 the plagues that they were seeing,

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,440
 Pharaoh opens his mouth and he makes that declaration,

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,440
 and he says, "You can go, you need to go."

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,840
 And this is a nation-defining moment for Israel.

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,760
 And this is a moment that's gonna set Israel up

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,640
 for the rest of their history.

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,080
 To this day, they look back on this moment

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,200
 as a moment of significant breakthrough,

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,740
 as God shifts them from a place of slavery

28
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,960
 to a place of freedom.

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,300
 And I wanna read this to you

30
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,200
 as we come into the word together today,

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,080
 because there's so much celebration and joy

32
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,840
 on the sense of God's heart

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,600
 as he sees his people released into their freedom.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,440
 Exodus 12, which is where we see this take place,

35
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,560
 starting in verse 31,

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,000
 and this happens on the night of the Passover,

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,540
 right where we were last week

38
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,320
 and where we left off last week, we continue right here.

39
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,720
 During the night, that night of Passover,

40
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,320
 Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said,

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,560
 "Up, leave my people, you and the Israelites, go.

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,380
 "Worship the Lord as you've requested.

43
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,220
 "Take your flocks and herds as you have said and go.

44
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,400
 "And also bless me."

45
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,200
 The Egyptians urged the people to hurry

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,680
 and leave the country,

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,360
 for otherwise, they said, "We will all die."

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,200
 So as the people took their dough

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
 before the yeast was added

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,240
 and carried it on their shoulders

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,160
 in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing,

52
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,980
 the Israelites did as Moses instructed

53
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,000
 and asked the Egyptians

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,720
 for articles of silver and gold for clothing.

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,240
 And the Lord made the Egyptians

56
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,440
 favorably disposed towards the people

57
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,360
 and they gave them what they had asked for.

58
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,060
 So they plundered the Egyptians.

59
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,000
 The Israelites journeyed from Ramesses to Sukkot

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,200
 and there were about 600,000 men on foot

61
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
 besides the women and children.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
 And many other people went up with them as well

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,160
 and large droves of livestock and flocks and herds.

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,280
 I wonder if you can sense the picture

65
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,780
 that Moses is trying to paint here for the reader,

66
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,680
 for this incredibly nation-defining moment.

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,960
 He says 600,000 men.

68
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
 He's using, unfortunately,

69
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,960
 the patriarchal culture of his day, discounting the men.

70
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,240
 And then he adds women and children.

71
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,340
 But scholars know that it was probably around

72
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,440
 about a million people that moved on that day.

73
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,060
 A million people who were released from their slavery

74
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,780
 and were beginning their long walk to the promised land.

75
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,540
 And this million people, it says here,

76
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,260
 there were also people from other places,

77
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,740
 many other types of people.

78
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,940
 So it wasn't just the Israelites

79
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,020
 that were walking in this parade of freedom, if you will.

80
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,680
 We know actually later on in this chapter

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,940
 that Egyptians come with them.

82
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,620
 But we also know that there are other ethnic minority groups

83
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,860
 who were perhaps also enslaved in Egypt

84
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,180
 at the time that the Hebrews were enslaved there,

85
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,660
 who are also given their freedom

86
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,980
 and are also able to go with the Israelites.

87
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,320
 So a million people walking together,

88
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,360
 carrying all that they owned,

89
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,620
 which as slaves, admittedly, wasn't very much,

90
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,780
 on their backs with their herds and their cattle,

91
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,980
 heading to a place of great freedom.

92
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,380
 And you can almost hear the conversations

93
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,980
 that must've been happening in this moment.

94
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,020
 You can imagine them saying, "Wow, can you believe it?

95
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,420
 Can you believe that this is actually happening?

96
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,820
 That actually change has come?

97
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,460
 That we're actually, God came through on his promises?"

98
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,660
 (congregation laughing)

99
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,860
 I'm like, "It's not that funny, but all right."

100
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,780
 What was happening?

101
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,860
 Is there a fly?

102
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,540
 I tell you what, that fly is from Satan.

103
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,180
 We've seen that fly many times.

104
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,380
 No, I'm not even joking.

105
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,620
 Once when I was preaching, it was like buzzing,

106
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,980
 where it landed on my head like three times.

107
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,020
 It literally is Beelzebub with wings.

108
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,020
 There it is, in Jesus' name.

109
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,180
 (congregation laughing)

110
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,060
 I just prayed against distractions in the name of Jesus.

111
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,660
 And everybody says?

112
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,500
 So many other people, flies included.

113
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,200
 I've been to Egypt, lots of flies,

114
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,380
 are making their journey towards freedom.

115
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,020
 And that conversation of hope is on their hearts.

116
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,340
 But right in the midst of all of that,

117
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,340
 Moses records to us four words in this story.

118
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,380
 Four words that actually seem completely out of place

119
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,220
 with everything else.

120
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,980
 Four words that actually are going to set up for Israel

121
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,900
 much of what God is gonna do in and through them

122
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,980
 in the weeks and months ahead

123
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,320
 as they journey to their freedom.

124
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,180
 Four simple words that were the last words

125
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,300
 that Moses hears from Pharaoh's lips.

126
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,380
 Let me read these words to you.

127
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,380
 It's this, "And also, bless me."

128
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,180
 Pharaoh turns to Moses and says, "And also, bless me."

129
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,220
 I wonder if you could get your head around this moment.

130
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,720
 Pharaoh has the audacity to say to Moses, "Bless me."

131
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,880
 And you can imagine Moses going, "What?"

132
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,920
 'Cause you've been the architect

133
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,100
 for around 80 years of your life

134
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,180
 of the oppression and slavery of my people.

135
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,620
 You've been the very one that's decreed our hardship,

136
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,780
 that's caused my people to live in abject poverty,

137
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,100
 that's caused us to be under some of the worst slavery

138
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,420
 that's ever been in all of history.

139
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,320
 And Pharaoh turns to Moses and says, "Would you bless me?"

140
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,060
 And you get the sense in this moment

141
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,420
 that Moses is like, "What are you talking about?"

142
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,540
 It defies all human logic to even consider

143
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,460
 that I would bless you for the years and the years

144
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,660
 and the years that your people have oppressed my people.

145
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:31,100
 But Pharaoh says, "And also, bless me."

146
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:38,900
 When we sit in the amazement of those words,

147
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,820
 we have to wrestle with some pretty major things

148
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,580
 'cause those words actually put a blinding spotlight

149
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,660
 on what is perhaps one of the most challenging teachings

150
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,060
 of all of our scripture and even central

151
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,660
 to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.

152
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,220
 And it is this, the call that we all have

153
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,220
 to bless, forgive, and release those who have hurt us,

154
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,240
 shamed us, done evil against us, abused us,

155
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,600
 or situations in our lives that have happened to us

156
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,720
 that have caused us great pain and hurt,

157
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,960
 perhaps even failures that we've done

158
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,620
 that we still continue to carry around with us,

159
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,460
 whether it's people or circumstances or situations,

160
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,320
 the scriptures call us to this radical thought

161
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,320
 that we are to forgive those, to bless even those

162
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,120
 that have done harm to us.

163
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,240
 I mean, get your head around this.

164
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,520
 The very first act that Moses is called to do

165
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,520
 after he finally is set free is to bless the very person

166
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,360
 who has abused and caused trauma on his people.

167
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,180
 And there are, for all of us in this room,

168
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,640
 people that have hurt us, things that have been done to us,

169
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,040
 things that have come against us in our lives.

170
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,520
 And if you're anything like me,

171
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,840
 every single one of us in this room,

172
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,820
 we carry baggage of those moments with us.

173
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,160
 We carry the baggage of the words, of the abuse,

174
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,680
 of the trauma, and of the hurt.

175
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,000
 And when Pharaoh turns to Moses and says, "Bless me,"

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,720
 you almost get the sense that God is standing right there

177
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,320
 in the moment alongside with Moses,

178
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,240
 and that God is almost over Moses in this moment,

179
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,020
 wondering and looking at what Moses will do.

180
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,280
 Will Moses have the courage to walk in the opposite spirit

181
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,160
 to all that Pharaoh had done to him?

182
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,720
 Would Moses have the audacity to actually do something

183
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,840
 which doesn't seem to make any human sense?

184
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,400
 Would Moses choose to walk in the opposite spirit

185
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,000
 of a hardened heart and have a soft heart

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,700
 to the one who had so abused him?

187
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,520
 Or would Moses turn his back?

188
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,360
 Would Moses refuse?

189
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,000
 Would Moses harden his heart and walk away

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,920
 in a place of bitterness and resentment?

191
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,960
 It's important you understand

192
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,920
 that Pharaoh did not deserve forgiveness.

193
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,960
 Pharaoh did not deserve forgiveness.

194
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,460
 He had done what he had done.

195
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,400
 And it almost seems like it would have been unjust

196
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,280
 for Moses to respond in this way,

197
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,520
 but God's ways are actually often so different to our ways.

198
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,440
 God's ways and his call is often so much higher

199
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,520
 than our call.

200
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,840
 And what God is about to do in and through this moment

201
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,080
 is something in Moses' life

202
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,560
 that would be not just a turning point

203
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,200
 for Israel towards their freedom,

204
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,380
 but a turning point for Moses himself.

205
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,480
 What's interesting is that the text doesn't tell us

206
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,520
 whether Moses did it or not, which is really fascinating.

207
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,000
 And although it's an argument from silence,

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,120
 scholars actually have analyzed all of the five books

209
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,400
 that Moses is writing, the first five books in the Bible.

210
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,640
 And pretty much every single time

211
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
 that Moses is asked to do something that Moses does not do,

212
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,000
 he says he does not do it, and he explains why.

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,280
 And in this moment, scholars say

214
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,280
 that because Moses is silent on the issue,

215
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,200
 as there are many other examples in those first five books,

216
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,880
 that when he's silent, it means he did do it,

217
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,160
 that the majority of scholarship believes

218
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,960
 that Moses didn't do it.

219
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,520
 He did bless.

220
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,320
 He did offer his forgiveness.

221
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,440
 He did turn to the very person

222
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,760
 who had so hurt him and his people,

223
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,840
 and he forgave him for those actions.

224
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,320
 And I think as we sit with this, as I sit with this,

225
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,960
 I realize that I would not have.

226
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,760
 And I think if we're honest with one another

227
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,960
 here in this room today, if you're honest with yourself,

228
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,600
 I think perhaps all of us would have struggled to do that.

229
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,720
 I mean, think about the weight of that moment,

230
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,040
 and all that it seems to hold.

231
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,400
 But God is calling in Moses and in Israel

232
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,280
 something that is so deeply profound

233
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,440
 that we all have to wrestle with,

234
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,600
 that our ability to forgive and to bless

235
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,520
 those who have done harm to us

236
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,920
 is perhaps the single most important thing we can do

237
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,160
 to both embrace and retain the freedom

238
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,800
 that God has designed for us.

239
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,160
 Come on, church.

240
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,280
 Our ability to forgive and to bless,

241
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,160
 to release the people who have done harm to us

242
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,040
 is actually perhaps the most important thing

243
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,720
 that we will ever do to enable ourselves

244
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,720
 to truly be free in this world.

245
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,320
 And God is standing with Moses in this moment,

246
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,600
 wondering what Moses will do.

247
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,560
 God knowing that if Moses refuses to bless,

248
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,480
 then Moses is going to leave Egypt with a heavy heart.

249
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,360
 Moses is gonna leave Egypt from a place

250
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,280
 where he's still carrying so much of that pain.

251
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,520
 So you need to understand that it's perfectly possible

252
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,200
 to be physically free, but to be emotionally,

253
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,120
 spiritually, and mentally chained.

254
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,400
 And God knows that if Moses doesn't do this,

255
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,680
 if Moses can't find the ability in himself

256
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,080
 to let Pharaoh go, to release him,

257
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,800
 to forgive him, to bless him,

258
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,280
 then he's gonna be emotionally, spiritually,

259
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,560
 and mentally chained, even in the place of freedom

260
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,400
 that God's given to him.

261
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
 And so God is inviting this moment.

262
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,160
 It's a terribly difficult one to get our head around.

263
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,560
 It doesn't seem in our human thinking to be just or right.

264
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,440
 And yet in it, in it,

265
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,400
 comes the greatest amount of freedom we will ever, ever know.

266
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,760
 The freedom of being set free from the things

267
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
 that wanna continue to chain us.

268
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,080
 In this way, this passage is actually not about Pharaoh

269
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,640
 releasing Israel.

270
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,520
 This passage is about whether Israel will release Pharaoh.

271
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,000
 And Pharaoh's request to Moses

272
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,240
 is actually God's invitation to Moses.

273
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,360
 God's invitation for Moses to be able to finally,

274
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,360
 fully, and completely walk free from the pain of his past.

275
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,880
 And I want you to know this today,

276
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,360
 whether you're in this room or online right now,

277
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,560
 it's the same invitation today to you.

278
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,600
 This moment right here, as we unpack this idea

279
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,640
 of what it means to love your enemy,

280
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,120
 what it means to bless those that have hurt and harmed you,

281
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,320
 right here is an invitation for you

282
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,800
 to walk into the greatest moments of freedom

283
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,080
 you will ever experience.

284
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,440
 Here's the reality.

285
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,080
 In every single moment of your life,

286
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,880
 there are three paradigms at work,

287
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,120
 your past, your present, and your future.

288
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,080
 And the great thing about being human

289
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,400
 is that all of us in every moment of life,

290
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,520
 we're moving towards our future.

291
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,800
 We're constantly on the move towards our future.

292
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,880
 But when somebody or a situation or a circumstance

293
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,480
 has hurt us, and when we carry that hurt

294
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,640
 and we hold on to that pain,

295
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,040
 when we feel that anxiety and that fear

296
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,880
 and that frustration, that sadness, that depression,

297
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,080
 whatever it might be, when we're holding onto that,

298
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,200
 here's what it's like.

299
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,960
 It's like we're walking into our future,

300
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,240
 facing towards our past.

301
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,120
 It's like the past is the primary thing we're focused on

302
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,200
 as we're moving to our future.

303
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,320
 When you do that, you're walking into your future,

304
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,960
 facing backwards.

305
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,680
 Now, if you're worried, I'm gonna fall off the stage,

306
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,720
 you probably should be worried.

307
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,040
 Because when you move into your future, facing backwards,

308
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,040
 then you're in danger of not moving into the future

309
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,880
 that God really has for you.

310
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,520
 And I can't tell you the number of people,

311
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,120
 myself included, many times,

312
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,680
 who are walking into our future, facing backwards,

313
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,840
 because we're allowing the pain and the hurt

314
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,920
 and the frustration and the disappointment,

315
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
 or whatever it was that happened in our past,

316
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,360
 to be the primary paradigm that's shaping our present

317
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,720
 and telling us about our future.

318
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,680
 Now, don't get me wrong,

319
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,520
 there's nothing wrong with the past.

320
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,680
 The past is actually a good thing.

321
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,640
 God's done a lot of things in your life in the past, I hope.

322
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,160
 And the past is a place where we get to see

323
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,520
 some of that stuff, we get to learn from our past.

324
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,200
 Even some of the hard things that have happened in our past,

325
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,360
 it's a way of shaping us and making us mature

326
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,120
 and helping us to be more of the person

327
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,000
 God's called us to be.

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,480
 So it's not like the past is wrong,

329
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,840
 but the problem comes when we allow the past

330
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,440
 to be the primary paradigm

331
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,920
 by which we think about the present

332
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,200
 and we work towards the future.

333
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,400
 God does not want you to walk into your future

334
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
 facing backwards,

335
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,280
 he wants you to walk into your future facing forwards,

336
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,520
 facing towards all the promises

337
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,000
 and the goodness that he has.

338
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,760
 But that's gonna require you

339
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,640
 and also bless me.

340
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,520
 It's gonna require you to do the one thing

341
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,920
 that is the most powerful thing

342
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,040
 to release you from the pain of your past.

343
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,920
 And that is forgiveness.

344
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,440
 I was in Belfast a few years ago.

345
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,720
 And if you've ever been to Belfast in Northern Ireland,

346
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,280
 fascinating city,

347
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,040
 a city that's gone through so much in terms of its history,

348
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,720
 it's the place of the troubles

349
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,480
 where Catholics and Protestants

350
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,360
 were basically at war between themselves

351
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,560
 on two streets of the city.

352
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,520
 And when I was there, I paid for a walking tour.

353
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,680
 I like to walk and I like cities, walking tours are great.

354
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,720
 And you basically, you hook up with this local guy

355
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,440
 and the local guy takes you around for two hours

356
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,800
 and he shows you the pubs where the bombings have happened

357
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,640
 and the roads and the separation

358
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,960
 between the Catholics and the Protestants

359
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,120
 and you kind of get a sense of everything that's happening

360
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,320
 or had happened in the past in Belfast.

361
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,000
 And as we're walking along,

362
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,280
 he pointed out all this graffiti that's in the city

363
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,080
 and he pointed out this one particular graffiti,

364
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,680
 I wanna read this to you, it said this.

365
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,720
 A nation that keeps one eye on the past is wise.

366
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,640
 A nation that keeps two eyes on the past is blind.

367
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,640
 And I think you could take that

368
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,320
 and you could apply that right to this moment

369
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,960
 here in Exodus,

370
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,200
 as God has now released his people and he looks at Moses

371
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,680
 and he says, "Moses, keeping one eye on the past is wise,

372
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,960
 but keeping two eyes on the past is blind

373
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,600
 and also bless me."

374
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,840
 That the only way, Moses, that you can walk forward

375
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,600
 into the freedom that I have for you

376
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,120
 is to release all of the things that's holding you back,

377
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,440
 all the things that are bounding you backwards

378
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,640
 into the past that has hurt you,

379
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,240
 the past that has enslaved you.

380
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,280
 The only way you can move forward in the way that you can

381
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,480
 is by keeping one eye on the past,

382
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,040
 learning and growing from the things

383
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,960
 that have experienced you,

384
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,480
 but keeping those eyes focused in the front,

385
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,480
 releasing your two eyes, finding that freedom.

386
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,520
 And it will only happen

387
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,160
 if we can find in ourselves

388
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,880
 the ability to bless,

389
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,120
 the ability to forgive,

390
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,880
 even the ones that have done the worst things to us.

391
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,920
 God invites us to recognize

392
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,640
 that our freedom only will come

393
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,360
 when we can let the past be the past.

394
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,880
 The question we should ask ourselves then

395
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
 is how do we do it?

396
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,320
 'Cause Andrew, if you just understood the pain,

397
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,960
 I mean, you wouldn't ask this of me.

398
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,640
 Jesus, if you understood what I've been through,

399
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
 you wouldn't command me to be one who forgives.

400
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,560
 How do we even get ourselves to the point

401
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,080
 where we can do that?

402
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,400
 To release the ones that have so hurt us

403
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,880
 and shaped us and shamed us,

404
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,400
 or even release ourselves.

405
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,560
 Sometimes the hardest person to forgive is yourself.

406
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,120
 Some of you in this room watching online right now,

407
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,720
 you're living a certain way in your life today.

408
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,440
 You're doing a certain job that you're doing

409
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,680
 because you've told yourself you don't deserve any better

410
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,960
 'cause of something that you did in the past.

411
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,280
 And you're as much enslaved to that thing

412
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,840
 as if someone else had done something to you.

413
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,560
 Some of you need to go and also bless me to your inner self

414
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,920
 and learn what it is to let yourself go

415
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,600
 from the mistakes and the brokenness of your past.

416
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,720
 When I was in Egypt, I had a incredible chance

417
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,600
 to sit down with a gentleman by the name of Peter.

418
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,680
 And Peter had experienced perhaps some of the most

419
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,360
 painful atrocity and trauma

420
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,600
 that you could perhaps even face in your life

421
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,400
 and had learned what it is to walk out of that

422
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,720
 in a call to forgiveness,

423
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,360
 to forgive the very ones that had brought so much pain

424
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,680
 into his own life.

425
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,200
 And as he sat there and shared his story with me,

426
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,280
 I realized that there was so many profound insights

427
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,120
 into this idea of what it means to bless

428
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,400
 and to forgive and to release

429
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,640
 that I wanted to sit down with him and capture it on camera,

430
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,520
 which is what we did.

431
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,880
 And I can't wait to show you this.

432
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,960
 It's not easy in places to see what happened for Peter,

433
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,640
 but I believe that inside of his story,

434
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,320
 there are so many nuggets for how you might be able

435
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,040
 to walk into better freedom for yourself.

436
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,000
 So let's take a look at Peter's story.

437
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,240
 Peter, we are so very grateful

438
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,680
 that you're with us here today

439
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,280
 and that you're gonna be willing to share your story with us.

440
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,760
 Thanks so much for being with us.

441
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,800
 - Thank you so much, Andrew.

442
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,280
 Thank you.

443
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,120
 - Why don't we start by you just explaining

444
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,760
 a little bit about yourself,

445
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,720
 where you're from, where you grew up,

446
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,120
 your family a little bit.

447
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,960
 - Okay.

448
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,960
 So we are a very normal family of me, my father,

449
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,800
 my mother, and my sister, Maria.

450
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,000
 And we all grew up in Egypt, in Cairo,

451
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,400
 and we are all a Coptic Orthodox people.

452
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,520
 And we, like any normal family,

453
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,960
 we just go into Sundays into the church.

454
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,120
 And then at some certain point,

455
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,680
 I had a turning point in my life

456
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,720
 after an incident happened in my life

457
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,880
 because of the bombing that happened because of ISIS.

458
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,720
 - Yeah.

459
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,560
 So my understanding is this took place in 2016

460
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,320
 in your church, essentially, here in Cairo.

461
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,080
 - We came and we all thought that nothing would happen

462
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,200
 in such a day because it is a very peaceful day.

463
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,760
 And we just go, me, my father, my sister,

464
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,320
 and my mother to the church.

465
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,440
 And then in the middle of the Holy Mass,

466
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,600
 a guy came into the church,

467
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,480
 and actually he looked very weird.

468
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,680
 Like even his face, even like you can Google him.

469
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,320
 You would like, you would notice him without a doubt

470
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,240
 that he's not a Christian.

471
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,720
 He's not full of peace.

472
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,600
 He's not all of that.

473
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,680
 And then after the church was all happy,

474
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,440
 was the church and everybody was going with the families,

475
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,120
 in a moment, I didn't hear anything.

476
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,400
 The whole church went into darkness.

477
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,080
 And then we saw like a dust everywhere.

478
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,960
 And then the chairs, the wooden chairs

479
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,480
 were like flying everywhere.

480
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,800
 And the glasses were throwing everywhere.

481
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,840
 And then there was a moment of silence.

482
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,960
 Everybody was understanding what is happening.

483
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,120
 And then I heard like screams everywhere.

484
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,280
 And I swear I never heard such screams

485
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,080
 like this in my whole life.

486
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,480
 And it was a slaughter.

487
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,760
 - A bombing at Cairo's largest Coptic cathedral

488
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,560
 has killed at least 25 people

489
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
 and wounded nearly 50 others.

490
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,240
 Most of the victims are reported

491
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
 to have been women and children.

492
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,760
 The explosion took place during a packed Sunday morning mass

493
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,200
 in a chapel adjoining St. Mark's.

494
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,960
 The cathedral in the capital is the main headquarters

495
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,560
 of Coptic Christians in Egypt.

496
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,440
 - And then I even forgot that my mother

497
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,840
 and my whole family was with me.

498
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,120
 So I just went to the place where they were screaming.

499
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,600
 I didn't know what happened.

500
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,480
 I just started to carry the dead people.

501
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,080
 I just thought that they are okay

502
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,760
 and maybe they are just injured.

503
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,320
 And then I started to remember

504
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,000
 that my mother and my sister are with me.

505
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,520
 And then when I came to my mother and sister,

506
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,640
 I just saw my father in front of me.

507
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,600
 And he was asking me, "They are both totally injured.

508
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,520
 "Whom should I pick to just go to the hospital?"

509
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,960
 And then it was a very hard question.

510
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,480
 It was a very hard decision.

511
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,280
 At the time, we just decided to pick up my sister

512
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,960
 because we felt like her chances are more better

513
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,160
 than my mother.

514
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,960
 And we even both, we just thought that my mother died,

515
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,440
 but we couldn't face each other at that point.

516
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,920
 And then I picked up my sister

517
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,200
 and I went to the hospital.

518
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,640
 And even when she was in the middle of her pain,

519
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,840
 she was asking about, "Where is Peter?

520
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,040
 "Where is my father?

521
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,440
 "Where is my mother?"

522
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,800
 And after she felt like everybody is okay,

523
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,080
 she felt like she started to look another way.

524
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,960
 And then she was keep calling the name of Jesus.

525
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,640
 I felt like, "Jesus, Jesus."

526
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,360
 And I was asking her if she can see anything.

527
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,640
 And she just said, "No, I just wanna see,

528
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,840
 "check that you're okay."

529
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,960
 And that's it.

530
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,600
 And she passed away.

531
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
 - And you must, I mean, how did you feel?

532
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,040
 Were you angry?

533
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,680
 - I was totally angry, Andrew.

534
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,080
 I was not that good believer that he was saying,

535
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,760
 "No, this is what was written in the Bible."

536
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
 No, I was totally mad.

537
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,080
 And to be honest, I didn't expect God,

538
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,880
 or I didn't expect Jesus to understand my feelings

539
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,160
 at this point.

540
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,160
 I didn't even know how he is going to respond me.

541
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,520
 - Yeah, it must be really quite incredible to think

542
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,160
 you're in a church, you're in God's house,

543
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,760
 and this tragedy happens right there.

544
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,440
 And it's very understandable that suddenly you were like,

545
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,400
 "Why did God allow this to happen?"

546
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,520
 And the anger that you felt towards him.

547
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,560
 It must have been very strong in you.

548
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,160
 - Yeah, and where is all of your promises

549
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,000
 that you are going to protect me,

550
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,880
 that no one will hurt me,

551
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,720
 that you are like in your hands, God?

552
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,880
 Where are these promises?

553
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,560
 Are these fake promises?

554
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,160
 What was all this book and all this Bible about then?

555
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,960
 And I started to pray,

556
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,480
 and I felt like I need to say everything in my heart,

557
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,840
 even if I feel that it's not right to say to God,

558
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,360
 but I need to be honest,

559
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,120
 because this is a turning point.

560
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,920
 And then I started to say to him,

561
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:44,120
 "Since my childhood, my mother that you took from me

562
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,400
 "and my sister, they were encouraging me to pray

563
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,800
 "and to be and serving in your house for you

564
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,920
 "and for the glory of your name.

565
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,680
 "How could you do this to me?

566
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,000
 "How do you leave all the bad people are living

567
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,880
 "and they are enjoying?"

568
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,440
 By the way, they were even,

569
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,040
 when I was carrying my sister,

570
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,600
 there were people outside of the church

571
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,440
 that they were supporting the Islamic people.

572
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,760
 They were just happy,

573
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,560
 and they were clapping while I was carrying my sister.

574
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,400
 - What?

575
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,920
 - I told you I passed by a very difficult moment.

576
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,360
 - Let me also ask you,

577
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,200
 so you were mad at God, very understandably.

578
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,960
 How did you feel towards ISIS,

579
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,640
 towards those that actually detonated the bomb

580
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,480
 in the church?

581
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,240
 - If I'm standing in front of like a big hole, okay?

582
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,080
 - Hole.

583
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,680
 - Hole, yeah.

584
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,720
 And someone, a deep hole,

585
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,360
 and then someone pushed me,

586
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,200
 and then I became totally injured and seriously injured.

587
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,040
 But by any somehow, I just got up

588
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,680
 and then I came out of the hole.

589
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,800
 What would be like my reaction?

590
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,720
 I think to take revenge of that guy.

591
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,040
 But what if I saw that this guy is a blind guy?

592
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,640
 What are you going to do to him?

593
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,680
 And he's totally blind.

594
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,240
 He never saw Jesus.

595
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,680
 He never knew about peace.

596
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,480
 All that he knew is just he needs to go to heaven

597
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,720
 and he needs to be crucified somehow.

598
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,040
 And this is--

599
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,440
 - Suicide bomber.

600
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,720
 - Yeah, and this is how he's going to heaven.

601
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,640
 He wants to kill the Christians

602
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,520
 because they are against God.

603
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,920
 And maybe he was doing this because he loves God.

604
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,000
 Although this is not what I do believe.

605
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,440
 I believe like who tries to find God,

606
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,600
 God would find him as he's standing in front of door.

607
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,160
 But he wants a certain things, and that's it.

608
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,800
 - You're angry at God.

609
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,640
 You're obviously feeling strong emotions

610
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,680
 towards the people that have killed your mother

611
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,160
 and your sister.

612
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,160
 We also know that the Bible speaks about forgiveness.

613
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,520
 And perhaps one of the most challenging things

614
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,160
 the Bible says about forgiveness is when Jesus says,

615
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,160
 "Well, if you don't forgive, I don't forgive you."

616
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,600
 So it's a very strong command.

617
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,480
 And I think for a lot of people watching this,

618
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,320
 they're probably thinking,

619
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,880
 well, they have to forgive their spouse

620
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,680
 if their spouse says something mean to them,

621
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,040
 or maybe they have to forgive their child

622
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,440
 if their child does something naughty.

623
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,120
 You're in a situation where you need to forgive

624
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,320
 somebody for killing your mother and your sister

625
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,840
 while you were in the room.

626
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,760
 I mean, I don't think there's many of us

627
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,960
 who are watching this who have ever had

628
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,320
 that kind of level of need for forgiveness.

629
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,280
 Can you talk us through a little bit of that journey for you?

630
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,240
 How did you ever even get yourself to the point

631
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,200
 where you could take that command of Jesus

632
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,720
 and apply it to this incident in your life?

633
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,840
 - To be honest, Andrew, at the first point

634
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,480
 or at the very beginning, I was even thinking

635
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,120
 that I want to get their revenge.

636
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,200
 I want to get their revenge.

637
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,480
 And I didn't know how.

638
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,560
 I never used to killing.

639
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,800
 I'm not used to killing.

640
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,440
 I never killed a fly.

641
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,200
 So what should I do as a revenge?

642
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,960
 I even started to look in the Bible.

643
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,360
 How can I go to revenge?

644
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,480
 Just give me a single example in the Bible

645
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,360
 of someone who got revenge.

646
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,280
 And actually I got that example.

647
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,280
 I started to think, when Stephen died,

648
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,280
 for example, he was that guy who was just carrying

649
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,280
 the clauses for the people who are going to kill him.

650
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,120
 - That's right.

651
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,960
 - Right?

652
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,320
 When the soul of St. Stephen went to the skies

653
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,040
 and went to God, there is a part in the Bible

654
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,240
 who says that the souls of the martyrs came to the Lord

655
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,000
 and then said, "When you are our almighty God,

656
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,840
 "we are going to have a revenge for us."

657
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,920
 And he said he will get their revenge, but later.

658
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,920
 Then I started to think, how did Stephen get his revenge?

659
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:36,080
 I think he got his revenge from the kingdom of darkness

660
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,840
 by getting Paul out of darkness to be the strongest guy

661
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,360
 who tells about Jesus.

662
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,280
 And then I started, okay, this is my turning point.

663
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,920
 I want to take that point.

664
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,840
 I want to take that revenge.

665
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,080
 I will take everybody who just blinded by the darkness

666
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,400
 to just get them from darkness into light.

667
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,480
 And this will be my strongest revenge.

668
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,640
 - Wow.

669
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,840
 What was it that really enabled you to fully forgive?

670
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,280
 'Cause obviously you were carrying some anger to God

671
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,520
 and to ISIS and to that situation.

672
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,920
 What was it that really allowed you to fully forgive

673
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,560
 and to release your forgiveness?

674
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,960
 - As I told you, it was always like a continuous way

675
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,840
 of thinking.

676
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,480
 My head was, I couldn't stop thinking at any time.

677
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,440
 But every time I was thinking, I was just, deep inside me,

678
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,600
 I was just telling Jesus, "Please don't leave me.

679
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,720
 "Please don't leave me.

680
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,360
 "Just guide me."

681
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,560
 And by every time I was just thinking in a bad way,

682
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,280
 or I'm just thinking to hurt someone,

683
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,720
 I knew deep inside that this was not right.

684
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,960
 This was not what Jesus wanted me to do.

685
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,120
 But at that point also, I totally knew

686
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,120
 that Jesus totally respects all our human feelings.

687
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,880
 And it just needs to be guided.

688
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,360
 And that's it.

689
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,640
 - And it seems like in all that you've been sharing,

690
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,320
 that forgiveness really happens

691
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,840
 through a process of being led by Jesus,

692
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,640
 knowing Jesus is with us, knowing He's present with us.

693
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,840
 And we're so grateful for that.

694
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,840
 I wanna thank you so much for sharing your story with us.

695
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,800
 I know it's not easy to relive emotions

696
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,880
 and feelings like that.

697
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,840
 And it's obviously a very personal story

698
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,840
 that you've so graciously shared with all of us.

699
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,880
 And I know that people watching this,

700
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,360
 they're gonna be able to connect to your story,

701
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,920
 even though perhaps they've never experienced

702
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,640
 anything like that in their life.

703
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,200
 But all of us have been commanded to forgive.

704
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,560
 All of us have to bring ourselves to the point

705
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,120
 where we even have to forgive those that we don't like,

706
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,360
 forgive those that are our enemies,

707
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,840
 even forgive those perhaps that have done

708
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,480
 the atrocious things that have happened to your family.

709
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,400
 And the only way we can do it

710
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,680
 is if Jesus is with us in that process

711
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,280
 and if Jesus meets us in that process, as you've shared.

712
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,640
 Thank you, Peter, deeply for being willing

713
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,880
 to share that story with us today.

714
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,000
 And we're so grateful to you.

715
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,080
 - Thank you so much, Andrew.

716
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,920
 Thank you.

717
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,120
 - Truly profound, right?

718
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,400
 What a beautiful man, what a beautiful story.

719
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,760
 And there are so many things that he shared in there

720
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,320
 that I think are very helpful for us

721
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,160
 as we think about the journey that we have

722
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,440
 to release the pain and the hurt

723
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,320
 and the brokenness of our past,

724
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,160
 and particularly release those that may have done it to us.

725
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,720
 I wanna share just a couple of quick ones

726
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,040
 just practically for you,

727
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,560
 because I want you to be able to practically

728
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,280
 take something away from what we've been talking about today.

729
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,720
 Here's the first thing, always put safety first.

730
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,160
 Always put safety first.

731
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,200
 What I mean by that is we need to distinguish

732
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,760
 between moments where we've had an abuse

733
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,640
 or something that's happened to us in our past

734
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,520
 and that's finished and we still feel the effects of it,

735
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,160
 but the abuse is finished,

736
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,200
 to moments where we're still currently

737
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,720
 under a place of getting abused.

738
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,840
 Obviously, the call to forgive

739
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,400
 when we're in a place of actual ongoing abuse

740
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,960
 doesn't make sense and isn't right.

741
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,600
 Safety is always first.

742
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,520
 We have to get ourselves to the place

743
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,320
 where we come out from under that abuse

744
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,200
 before I think Jesus leads us into a process

745
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,360
 of forgiving the person that's been abusing us.

746
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,920
 You gotta note that Moses,

747
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,440
 Moses was actually in a process of his freedom

748
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,240
 when God asks him to bless Pharaoh.

749
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,760
 God doesn't ask him to do that

750
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,720
 whilst Pharaoh is still abusing them

751
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,280
 and they're still under a context of slavery.

752
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,960
 It's only once that slavery has finished

753
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,320
 that Moses is in a place where he can begin a process

754
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,520
 of understanding what it would be for him

755
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,920
 to bless and forgive Pharaoh.

756
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,080
 It's very important you understand this

757
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,560
 'cause forgiveness does not mean

758
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,800
 that you should stay in a situation of abuse.

759
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,840
 Forgiveness does not mean that you should go back

760
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,420
 to a person potentially

761
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,200
 who has been abusing you in the past.

762
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,840
 Sometimes in my pastoral work

763
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
 that I've been doing with the church over so many years,

764
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,920
 people begin to think that forgiveness means,

765
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,160
 oh, well, I guess, Pastor Andrews called me to forgive.

766
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,120
 I guess I just need to stay being abused

767
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,720
 by this person in this situation.

768
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,520
 That's my way of showing forgiveness.

769
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,720
 That's not what this passage is saying

770
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,320
 and it's not what we're preaching, safety first.

771
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,800
 Everybody understand that?

772
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,100
 Okay, it's really important.

773
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,080
 But here's the second thing, okay?

774
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,380
 Know that you're in a battle of power.

775
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,960
 I thought one of the things that Peter shares there

776
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,960
 was so helpful for us to think about the reality of power.

777
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,040
 And first of all, you've got to understand

778
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,240
 that you're in a battle of power

779
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,720
 by what the enemy has done to you

780
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,160
 through whatever circumstances,

781
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,720
 situations that's happened in the past.

782
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,200
 And that power is held over us by manifesting itself

783
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,680
 in the emotions that we carry today

784
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,560
 when we think about that event in the past.

785
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,480
 So when we feel today anxious and frightened or sad

786
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,160
 or angry or bitter or whatever it might be,

787
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,100
 shame or failure today because of something in the past,

788
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,480
 that's the power that that thing still has over us.

789
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,840
 And forgiveness is God's way of disempowering

790
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,760
 the power that that event has taken hold over us.

791
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,680
 And so the reason why God calls Moses to do this

792
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,320
 is because he wants that power to go.

793
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,920
 He wants the power of all that slavery

794
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,200
 to be disempowered in Moses's heart and life

795
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,320
 by his ability to let it go.

796
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,360
 So you need to understand that you're in a battle of power

797
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,640
 and the work of forgiveness is your way of disempowering

798
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,600
 what the enemy is trying to do for you

799
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,480
 to keep you locked in decisions

800
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,320
 about your present and your future

801
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,200
 based on the pain and the hurt

802
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,040
 of that situation in the past.

803
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,000
 Does that make sense to you?

804
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,560
 And I love the way that Peter brings this up as well.

805
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,280
 He talks about that idea of revenge.

806
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,360
 And he says, "I wanted to get revenge

807
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,560
 "by physically doing something to that person."

808
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,300
 But then he said, "Revenge actually is this,

809
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,580
 "taking somebody out of the kingdom of darkness

810
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,600
 "and bringing them into the kingdom of light."

811
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,040
 Wasn't that beautiful?

812
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,440
 He said, "The best way that I can fight back ISIS

813
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,680
 "for what they've done for me

814
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,920
 "is not by picking up bombs and shooting them

815
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,220
 "and making violence on violence.

816
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,600
 "The best way is to embrace a nonviolent response

817
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,420
 "in finding myself blessing them by sharing the gospel

818
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,800
 "because they're blind people knocking people into holes."

819
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,680
 I mean, the guy whose mother and sister was killed

820
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,780
 is able to say, "There's a gospel work

821
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,020
 "that could be done out of this

822
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,280
 "that is the best form of what it looks like

823
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,120
 "to make this thing right."

824
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,060
 And Peter's dedicated his life now

825
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,180
 to being somebody who menaces the gospel

826
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,920
 and shares the gospel with Muslims

827
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,320
 and Islamic people of that background,

828
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,000
 believing that if he can help some people

829
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,760
 come to see God for who he truly is,

830
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,920
 then something can really change in his city.

831
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,080
 Something can really change in his culture.

832
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,320
 And also bless me.

833
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,560
 The third thing is this.

834
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,080
 Confront the hurt that you are carrying.

835
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,200
 Notice that I didn't say,

836
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,000
 confront the person who has hurt you.

837
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,800
 Confront the hurt that you are carrying.

838
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,040
 Sometimes we think that forgiveness and reconciliation

839
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,880
 are the same thing.

840
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,120
 Forgiveness and reconciliation are not the same thing.

841
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,600
 And sometimes people mistake the idea

842
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,900
 of the command to forgive,

843
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,560
 meaning that they have to reconcile with that individual.

844
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,160
 And if they don't reconcile with that person,

845
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,440
 then they haven't really forgiven them.

846
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,440
 You need to understand that forgiveness and reconciliation

847
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,720
 are two different things in scripture.

848
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,240
 Forgiveness, a command of Christ that we can do,

849
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,800
 whether the person that has hurt us or not responds at all.

850
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,600
 We can still do that process of forgiveness.

851
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,440
 Reconciliation, requiring two people to come together

852
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,280
 and build a new relationship together,

853
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,520
 be committed to doing that.

854
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,000
 And you can't always reconcile with the person that hurt you.

855
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,380
 And in some cases, it's actually not safe for you

856
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,440
 to reconcile with the person who's abused you.

857
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,000
 But what you can do is forgive them.

858
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,840
 What you can do is bring yourself to a place

859
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,720
 of releasing that hold that they have.

860
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,040
 And the way that you do that is you confront

861
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,160
 where that power comes from and the source of that power.

862
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,840
 That's in your emotions.

863
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,180
 That's in the things that you're carrying,

864
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,500
 the hurt and the shame and the pain and all of that.

865
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,500
 As you confront the hurt you are carrying,

866
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,080
 you expose it in order for it to be healed.

867
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,120
 My wife, who's a therapist, said to me last week,

868
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,360
 and when she said this,

869
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,160
 it was like one of those mic drop moments for me.

870
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,860
 She said, "You can't heal what you don't feel."

871
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,760
 And so often I think what we think

872
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,800
 is the way we forgive somebody for hurting us

873
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,240
 is by burying the hurt, ignoring the hurt,

874
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,880
 trying to pretend like the hurt's not there.

875
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,120
 And I love Peter in the film.

876
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,280
 He's like, "Andrew, I was feeling all this stuff.

877
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,180
 "And I had to say some things to God

878
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,000
 "that I wasn't even sure if you could say to God."

879
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,900
 Because he had to let his feelings out.

880
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,800
 He had to find an expression of that.

881
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,720
 He had to make sure that those feelings didn't consume him.

882
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,280
 He didn't bury those feelings so deep inside of him

883
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
 that his whole life is shaped by those feelings

884
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,360
 in expressing them, in sharing them.

885
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
 He was getting them out.

886
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,120
 In confronting the hurt,

887
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,200
 he was placing himself in a position

888
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,800
 to be healed and restored.

889
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,800
 Now, the reason why we can do this

890
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,140
 is 'cause it's not like we're serving some God

891
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,520
 who's never felt anything in his life.

892
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,200
 Jesus, at the very core of the Christian faith,

893
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,240
 comes and takes on flesh,

894
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,360
 becomes one of us and feels our pain with us.

895
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,260
 He's not up on some cloud going, "Feel your pain."

896
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,560
 He's like, "I have come to feel your pain.

897
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,100
 "I have come to feel what's even worse

898
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,520
 "than you may ever feel in your life.

899
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,820
 "I've come to take on the sin of the world on my shoulders,

900
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,440
 "and I will be on that cross."

901
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,200
 And you know the words that come out of his mouth

902
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,040
 on that cross?

903
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,680
 "Forgive them, Lord, for they know not what they do."

904
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,960
 Jesus, in taking on the pain of the world,

905
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,120
 means that when we follow Christ,

906
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,760
 we have somebody who knows and understands

907
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,640
 and advocate for the pain that we feel,

908
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,080
 and there is no pain that we will feel

909
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,520
 that Christ has not already felt and not overcome.

910
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,280
 So confront the hurt you're carrying.

911
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,840
 Here's a way you can do that.

912
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,280
 Just get a journal, get your phone with Notes app

913
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,960
 or whatever, sit down and say,

914
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,840
 "Lord, here is what I'm holding.

915
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,000
 "Here is what has happened to me in that situation,

916
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,280
 "and here's the fear, here's the anger,

917
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,360
 "here's the shame, here's the hurt."

918
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,200
 Whatever it is, and you write it down,

919
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,920
 just write it down, and writing it down,

920
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,240
 it's a prayer to him.

921
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,480
 He's saying, "God, I'm not gonna hide from these things,

922
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,040
 "I'm not gonna ignore these things.

923
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,200
 "They're right here in my life, and I recognize them,

924
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,800
 "and I recognize that these things are doing stuff

925
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,160
 "that I don't like in me, and so I bring them to you."

926
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,920
 And pray and release those feelings.

927
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,080
 Ask the Holy Spirit to come and meet you in those feelings.

928
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,040
 Ask him to free you from the ways in which you feel,

929
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,720
 and you will find yourself set free in a way

930
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,440
 that you've never been felt before.

931
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,560
 I love the way Peter goes,

932
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,400
 there was such peace for him,

933
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,200
 as he was able to confront the feelings he had

934
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,960
 in his conversation with God.

935
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,160
 Here's the fourth thing.

936
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,200
 Have a community around you.

937
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,640
 Rely on your community.

938
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,600
 Share with your community.

939
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,480
 The number one thing that the enemy will do

940
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,280
 with the hurts in your life is to cause you

941
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,360
 to make it private.

942
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,480
 The enemy wants you to soak in the privacy of your pain.

943
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,960
 And when you expose that pain,

944
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,000
 when you expose it and share it with the people

945
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,680
 that Christ has put around you in your life,

946
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,440
 that's what church is all about.

947
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,240
 That's what our community groups are all about.

948
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,160
 That's what spiritual friendships are all about.

949
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,080
 It's about having people in your life

950
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,000
 that you can walk with and say, "This is how I'm feeling.

951
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,600
 "This was a situation that happened to me.

952
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,480
 "I need prayer, I need support."

953
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,680
 Paul, when he writes to the church in Galatia,

954
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,400
 he says this, in Galatians chapter six, verse two,

955
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,880
 he says, "Carry each other's burdens,

956
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,200
 "and by doing this, you'll fulfill the law of Christ."

957
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,800
 Share your burdens with one another.

958
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,200
 And you'll actually live out the way

959
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,040
 that Christ wants you to live in this world.

960
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,320
 It's not about a privacy of pain.

961
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,400
 It's about saying, "I can't in and of myself carry this.

962
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,640
 "I can't deal with this.

963
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,600
 "I need someone to pray for me, stand with me,

964
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,280
 "encourage me, walk with me.

965
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,240
 "Would you help me?"

966
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,640
 None of us are adequate in and of ourselves

967
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,000
 to process and deal with some of the deep trauma

968
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,080
 that we carry.

969
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,400
 And unless you process it, you'll carry it around with you

970
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,880
 for the rest of your life and never truly be free.

971
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,040
 The church is a great gift to you.

972
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,320
 Whether it's Oasis,

973
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,640
 having professional people supporting you.

974
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,600
 Whether it's our prayer team here at the Vine

975
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,080
 after a service and having people

976
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,120
 who have prayerfully trained themselves

977
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,080
 in ministry of prayer to pray for you.

978
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,200
 Or whether it's your community groups

979
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,080
 or people around you, get a community.

980
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,280
 Get it a community.

981
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,060
 That is an important part of the process

982
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,840
 of forgiving those that have hurt us.

983
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,460
 And here's the final thing.

984
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,500
 Turn to your future.

985
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,680
 It's really important that you know

986
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,540
 that your past is not the model for your future.

987
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,400
 You need to really understand that the brokenness

988
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,140
 and the pain and the hurt of your past

989
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,400
 is not the thing that determines

990
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,000
 the direction of your future.

991
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,280
 All it does is determine your starting point.

992
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,600
 And the whole of the Exodus,

993
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,360
 the word Exodus itself means, remember, a departure point.

994
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,280
 The whole of it means to depart from something.

995
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,920
 And when you find yourself in a place

996
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,400
 where you can do this, where you can turn to your future

997
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,480
 and say, I want the promises of God

998
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,120
 more than the pain of holding onto that.

999
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,200
 I don't want two eyes on my past.

1000
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,700
 I wanna have my eyes focused looking forward.

1001
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,840
 As we turn to the hope of our future,

1002
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,200
 we're able then to release our past

1003
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,600
 and not allow our past to determine

1004
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,060
 the direction of our future,

1005
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,960
 but instead allow God's promises,

1006
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,040
 His word, His hope, His freedom

1007
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,720
 to tell you who you should be today

1008
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,840
 and who you will be tomorrow.

1009
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,940
 Too many of you in this room,

1010
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,400
 you're allowing that pain and that hurt

1011
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,760
 to define who you are.

1012
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,960
 God says, and also bless me,

1013
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,240
 release the pain,

1014
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,560
 break the power that it has in you

1015
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,520
 through this subversive act of forgiveness.

1016
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,480
 And as you forgive that,

1017
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,720
 you'll find yourself putting your hands on the plow

1018
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,120
 and not looking back over your shoulder

1019
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,440
 and be able to walk confidently

1020
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,080
 into the future that God has you.

1021
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,440
 And I wanna close by saying this,

1022
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,160
 this whole idea of and also bless me

1023
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,760
 is perhaps the most significant thing

1024
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,200
 that our city needs right now.

1025
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,840
 'Cause if you think about all that's happened

1026
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,680
 over the last four years,

1027
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,720
 with the protest time and the COVID time,

1028
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,960
 and when you look at all the things

1029
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,920
 that have happened through that,

1030
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,020
 there are so many people in our city

1031
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,380
 that are still holding on to the hurt

1032
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,760
 and the anger and the bitterness

1033
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,000
 and the brokenness towards one another.

1034
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,360
 And I tell you this,

1035
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,920
 the thing that's really gonna help Hong Kong to flourish,

1036
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,560
 it is not going to be the best economy.

1037
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,320
 It is not going to be the fact

1038
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,920
 that we can all travel now and have great holidays.

1039
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,080
 It's not going to be the fact

1040
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,000
 that we don't have to be in quarantine anymore.

1041
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,880
 The thing that's truly gonna flourish this city

1042
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,220
 is when this city is able to forgive one another.

1043
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,220
 When this city finally gets itself

1044
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:12,220
 to the point where it can actually release one another

1045
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,440
 from the hurt that we have caused one another.

1046
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,200
 And I don't know about you, but if I think about for me,

1047
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,180
 there are many pharaohs that I can think of

1048
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,780
 over the last four years for me.

1049
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,700
 And maybe that is the same for you.

1050
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,940
 And whether you're pharaohs of the government,

1051
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,940
 the police, student protesters, COVID policies,

1052
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,840
 restrictions that were placed upon you,

1053
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,140
 laws that have been passed, whatever it might be for you,

1054
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,820
 and also bless me.

1055
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,680
 'Cause the true hope for our city

1056
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,640
 will be when the church can demonstrate

1057
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,100
 the power that there is in letting go,

1058
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,840
 the power that there is in forgiving and loving

1059
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,020
 even those that have harmed us and hurt us.

1060
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,840
 So as you walk into your freedom,

1061
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,700
 as Israel moves into their freedom,

1062
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,580
 as Moses begins to journey them towards freedom,

1063
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,120
 the first thing Moses has to do is say,

1064
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,460
 "I bless you, I forgive you, I release you,

1065
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,140
 'cause I don't want anything that you have done to me

1066
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,740
 to be a part of my present or a part of my future.

1067
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:27,220
 And I am gonna disempower the pain and the hurt

1068
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:32,100
 by releasing it through the precious blood of Jesus Christ,

1069
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,380
 releasing it so that I can truly be free."

1070
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,360
 Some of you today, that's the greatest thing

1071
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,580
 that you will ever do,

1072
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:44,200
 is find true freedom from your past

1073
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,620
 so you can walk into your future.

1074
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,860
 Can I pray for you?

1075
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,660
 Let's pray.

1076
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,780
 Father, I thank you for every person here

1077
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,080
 in the room and online.

1078
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,180
 Father, we just take a moment now to sit

1079
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:05,020
 in the need that we have for your grace and your spirit.

1080
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:10,700
 Father, I pray for every person

1081
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:15,040
 because we are all carrying some hurt,

1082
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,900
 some trauma, some pain, some challenge, some circumstance.

1083
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,440
 Some unforgiveness that sits within us.

1084
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,000
 And though we might think that most of the time

1085
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,160
 we can get away with it,

1086
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,040
 we recognize that actually

1087
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,560
 it's slowly disintegrating our soul.

1088
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,240
 It's slowly hardening our heart

1089
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,140
 and it is holding us more captive than we ever realized.

1090
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:47,780
 And so, Father, we come to you today in hope.

1091
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,680
 We come to you with this profound idea

1092
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,080
 that Moses had to bless Pharaoh

1093
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,800
 as the very first thing he did in his freedom.

1094
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,640
 And Lord, for us as a church to be free,

1095
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,700
 for us as a city to be free,

1096
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,800
 and for us as individuals to be free,

1097
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,600
 we're gonna have to learn what it is

1098
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,120
 to journey in forgiveness.

1099
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,780
 Father, as we put safety first,

1100
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,280
 as we understand that we're in this battle of power,

1101
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,440
 that that ultimately sits in your hands,

1102
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,800
 as we confront the hurt that we carry

1103
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,880
 and don't allow that hurt

1104
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,340
 to be the predominant thing that drives us,

1105
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,120
 as we look to one another to support

1106
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,440
 and find that community together,

1107
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,560
 and as we decide to turn to our future,

1108
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,440
 knowing that our past doesn't determine

1109
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,960
 the direction of our lives,

1110
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,440
 Father, in this, we ask that you would truly set us free.

1111
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,320
 I want you just to take a moment,

1112
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,020
 just with you and the Holy Spirit,

1113
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,400
 and just allow the Holy Spirit just to speak to you

1114
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,720
 and meet you where you are at in this moment.

1115
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,040
 Come, Holy Spirit.

1116
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,760
 The Holy Spirit's gonna bring to mind

1117
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,720
 for some of you people that he wants you to bless.

1118
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,080
 People that he wants you to forgive.

1119
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:23,080
 The Holy Spirit's gonna show you

1120
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,640
 maybe even some of the pain,

1121
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:31,280
 maybe some of the hurt that he wants to release from you.

1122
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,680
 And as I said early in the message,

1123
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,520
 some of you in this room,

1124
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,720
 and I feel this particularly for this service,

1125
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,240
 it's you who has hurt yourself,

1126
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,720
 and you can't forgive yourself

1127
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,680
 for something that you did in the past.

1128
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:53,200
 God wants to release you from that self-hatred

1129
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,040
 that you're carrying.

1130
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,720
 Some of you, that's a word I sense in my spirit

1131
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,040
 as I'm praying, self-hatred.

1132
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,040
 Some of you in this room,

1133
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,740
 you really don't like who you are.

1134
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:06,440
 That's a work of the enemy over you,

1135
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,520
 and we as a church stand with you,

1136
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,800
 and we pray that you would come to see how God sees you,

1137
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,480
 and that you will be set free from the self-hatred

1138
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,240
 that the enemy has placed upon you,

1139
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,280
 and that you'll realize that your past

1140
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,640
 doesn't determine your future.

1141
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,000
 Come, Holy Spirit, come.

1142
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:35,400
 Father, we stand in the hope.

1143
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,640
 In fact, I just feel like we should do that.

1144
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,520
 Would you just all stand with me?

1145
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,160
 (gentle music)

1146
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,800
 I wanna pray this over you.

1147
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,080
 Father, we stand in the hope that comes

1148
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,180
 because of the work of the cross of Christ,

1149
00:52:55,180 --> 00:53:00,000
 and although this teaching today is challenging,

1150
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,640
 Father, it will set us free,

1151
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,040
 and so, Father, I wanna pray that you would bring freedom

1152
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,640
 for every person here.

1153
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,740
 I wanna pray for the hope that there is

1154
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:11,680
 in the cross of Christ.

1155
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,720
 I wanna pray for the blood that we talked about last week

1156
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,120
 to truly set us free.

1157
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,720
 Lord, I wanna pray against the strategies

1158
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,420
 that the enemy has over each family, over each marriage,

1159
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:25,160
 over each parent, and over each child,

1160
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,900
 and over every business,

1161
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,920
 that the enemy has these strategies

1162
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,120
 to lock us to the brokenness of our past

1163
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,200
 when God wants nothing more than the hope of our future.

1164
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,440
 Lord, I pray, releasing in Jesus' name

1165
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,560
 to the hope and the glory of your future, Lord,

1166
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,560
 and I pray, Lord, that people this week

1167
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,040
 would feel a peace, a lightness, a release

1168
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,960
 from emotions and feelings and pain

1169
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,220
 that they've been carrying for a long time.

1170
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,520
 Lord, there are years that are being wiped away

1171
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,480
 in the name of Jesus right now.

1172
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,240
 Lord, I pray for the glory that comes.

1173
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,560
 Lord, we thank you for Peter

1174
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,800
 and the way that he can speak so positively now

1175
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,800
 about the joy that is found

1176
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,140
 in releasing those that have harmed his family.

1177
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,480
 Lord, I pray for the power that will come for the vine

1178
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,400
 out of a group of people who can release the pain

1179
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,000
 and the brokenness of their past,

1180
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,840
 who can walk into their futures facing forwards.

1181
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,680
 Lord, I pray for the power that that would be

1182
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,080
 for the city of Hong Kong.

1183
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,640
 And Lord, we ask that you would do it amongst us

1184
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,080
 in Jesus' name.

1185
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,280
 Everyone says.

1186
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,280
 - Amen.

1187
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,120
 - Amen.

1188
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,120
 Can we worship together?

1189
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,560
 Let's worship together.

1190
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,120
 Let's finish with a moment of worship

1191
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,240
 before we do anything else,

1192
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,520
 and then Kyla will come in a moment

1193
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,280
 and pray over you as we depart.

1194
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,120
 But let's worship.

1195
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,120
 (music)
