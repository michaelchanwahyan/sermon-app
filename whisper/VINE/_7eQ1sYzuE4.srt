1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,180
 So help us to receive that we make room for your word and so Jesus. Thank you in your name. We pray. Amen

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,200
 Welcome everyone and welcome to everyone who's joining us online

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,800
 Some weeks ago

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,840
 One of my daughters my son and I were returning home and as we came up to our apartment building

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,240
 you have to scan your octopus card to get in it's specially linked and

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:39,360
 In previous years if you were a family unit and you're coming in just one of you needed to zap your card and

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,880
 You know, you could all enter but lately they've gotten really strict and they've been wanting everyone to

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,480
 Touch their card as they come in

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,520
 So as we came up to the doorway my son and my daughter were in front of me

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,120
 I was behind them. I had my earphones in and I was watching on my phone

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,520
 one of the loves of my life rugby

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,520
 So I was completely immersed in this game and and

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,700
 My two children were in front of me and they both went and zapped their cards and I just followed in behind them

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:21,360
 I did not zap my card and the elderly security guard. He he saw me and he pointed at the machine like

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,040
 You need to zap your card

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,240
 and I ignored him and

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,880
 Kept walking and I kind of pointed to my son and daughter like I'm with them and I must have made a noise something like

18
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,880
 huh, and

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,960
 It must have been a little bit loud because my son immediately turned around to me and he said

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,440
 That was really rude

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,320
 And

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,480
 So when Andrew asked me to speak on this message of living a life worthy of the calling of God

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,600
 And I'm somebody that's still being held accountable

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,120
 in the way I walk and live by my son I

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,760
 Was like writing back to Andrew going, you know, I'll do this

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:15,680
 but you need to know that this is very much something that I'm wrestling with and I'm a work in progress and

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,480
 He replied back to me. He said yes, that's the honesty that we need

28
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,680
 So today I'll be sharing with you some things that

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:34,400
 Are at work within me and I hope that they will be an encouragement to you as well

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,680
 let's read Ephesians 4 verses 1 to 10 as

31
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,800
 A prisoner for the Lord then I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received

32
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,600
 Be completely humble and gentle be patient

33
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:57,000
 Bearing with one another in love make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,800
 There is one body and one spirit just as you were called to one hope

35
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,840
 When you were called one Lord one faith one baptism

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:15,040
 One God and father of all who is overall and through all and in all but to each one of us

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,280
 Grace has been given as Christ apportioned it

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,280
 This is why it says when he ascended on high he took many captives and gave gifts to his children

39
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,300
 What does he ascended mean except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions?

40
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,560
 He who descended is the very one who ascended

41
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,640
 Higher than all the heavens in order to fill the whole universe

42
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:51,320
 I'd like to focus first on Ephesians 4 verse 1 as a prisoner for the Lord then I urge you

43
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,720
 To live a life worthy of the calling you have received

44
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,760
 The New King James Version says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord

45
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,440
 beseech you to walk worthy of the calling with which you are called

46
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,200
 What word or words do you focus on when you hear these verses?

47
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,440
 My eyes get drawn to the word worthy

48
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,120
 Walk worthy live worthy and lately I found myself

49
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,320
 Measuring myself and asking myself am I living a life that is worthy enough?

50
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:36,480
 At times I felt guilty because I feel like I've not been doing enough that there are expectations

51
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480
 I'm not fulfilling

52
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,120
 I've wrestled with whether my life is turning out the way

53
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,160
 God intended it to I wonder if there's anyone here this morning. That's asked a similar question

54
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,360
 It's my life

55
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,920
 turning out the way

56
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
 God intended it to

57
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,040
 Recently on one of my bus commutes to school and as you know if you've heard me preach before

58
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,640
 There's always something from my bus commutes to school. I felt God shift my focus in

59
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,040
 The verse away from the word worthy to the words walk and live

60
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:20,620
 God reminded me in a profound way that our worthiness has nothing to do with us

61
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:28,840
 We cannot do anything to walk more worthy or live more worthy

62
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,400
 We have been made worthy through an act of grace an

63
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,860
 undeserved lavish gift of love

64
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,320
 I'll say it again our worthiness has nothing to do with us

65
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,760
 It has everything to do with a precious gift of a son

66
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,440
 whose perfection and

67
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,320
 goodness

68
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,640
 Covers us as we walk out our sanctification journey

69
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,960
 Paul spends the first half of his letter

70
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,200
 Going into extravagant detail of the wondrous things God has done for us

71
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,800
 He chose us in love. He adopted us

72
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,960
 All of this freely given by God's extravagant grace

73
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:29,160
 Our eyes might be drawn to this word worthy and for some of us it may have made you feel disqualified

74
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,240
 But this is not what this verse is about

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,800
 It is not what Paul was trying to convey

76
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,720
 Commentators believe that Paul was under house arrest in Rome when he wrote this letter

77
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,240
 He was unable to walk and live freely and here

78
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,200
 He was telling and calling God's people to use their freedom to walk and live

79
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,280
 worthy of the calling they had received

80
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,200
 To walk and live in the calling of God has nothing to do with our worthiness. The calling is worthy

81
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,040
 Our primary calling is to be in a personal relationship with God

82
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,680
 to be a son or a daughter of God if we have received and

83
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,760
 Responded to this calling we have been made worthy

84
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:31,240
 So Paul's focus was not to call the people to worthiness this had already been achieved by them receiving and

85
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,320
 Responding to God's call to be in relationship with him

86
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,720
 Paul was urging them

87
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:47,520
 Beseeching them this word means to ask someone urgently or fervently to do something

88
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,960
 Paul was urging them to do something with this precious calling they had received

89
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,400
 To understand that this calling to become a son and daughter was not only for them

90
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,280
 It was for the church and the world around them

91
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,240
 He was imploring them to walk in it live it out do something with it

92
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:17,200
 Under house arrest Paul was well aware that his ability to walk and live out his calling had been somewhat limited

93
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,160
 His imprisonment had opened his eyes to how necessary

94
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,760
 It was that God's people did not waste their freedom

95
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,600
 Their opportunity to do something with this incredible gift

96
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,040
 This incredible calling they had received

97
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:43,760
 So in summation of this first verse the calling is worthy. It's the calling is worthy of our attention

98
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,280
 You do not have to be worthy

99
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:52,320
 In fact, you cannot ever be in your own strength or by your own endeavors

100
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,840
 Worthiness is a gift we receive when we choose

101
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,760
 Jesus

102
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,360
 Who traded his perfection?

103
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,960
 His worthiness for our ugliness our flaws our shame on the cross

104
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,360
 The calling is worthy our calling to be in relationship with God to listen and respond to his voice

105
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,840
 It requires our fervent and urgent

106
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,000
 attention

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,880
 We are required to do something in response to this precious gift

108
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,720
 Our calling begins in relationship with Christ and as the Holy Spirit works within us

109
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:43,720
 Drawing us closer to God. We inevitably get drawn closer to the focus of God's hearts, which is people

110
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,840
 We get drawn closer to each other

111
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:53,120
 We share God's heart for the people in our everyday lives in society and around the world

112
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,960
 So we are not called to do anything in our own strength

113
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,440
 Paul prays that the eyes of our heart

114
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,400
 May be enlightened in order that we may know his

115
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:13,440
 God's in care incomparably great power for us who believe the same power

116
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,720
 The mighty strength God used to raise Jesus from the dead

117
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,520
 lives within us

118
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,560
 Paul was wanting the believers of Ephesus to understand this power

119
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,920
 this power of the Holy Spirit at work within them and

120
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:37,640
 It is as we allow and respond to the work of the Spirit that God works

121
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,800
 inevitably

122
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,600
 Through our lives and his good works

123
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,320
 flow out of our lives

124
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:54,040
 From chapter 4 Paul begins to encourage the people in the church about the way in which they should walk and live in community

125
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,160
 He doesn't start by telling the believers in the church go out and do this

126
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,560
 Go out and do that. He actually starts by talking to them about their attitudes

127
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,400
 be completely humble and

128
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,000
 gentle

129
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Be patient

130
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,120
 bearing with one another in love

131
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,480
 Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace

132
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,960
 Let's stop for a minute and take a reality check

133
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,560
 How strong are these qualities in our lives?

134
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:40,720
 Paul is writing to a church calling them to try hard to achieve unity and peace

135
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,560
 Reminding them that it can only be done if their lives are filled with humility

136
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,880
 gentleness

137
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,880
 patience and love

138
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,840
 Examine your attitudes of late

139
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:02,520
 Where do humility gentleness patience and love rank in your life? I

140
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,240
 Shared with you at the beginning

141
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,280
 one of my stories

142
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,600
 Think back on your weeks leading up to this day

143
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,640
 Where do humility gentleness patience and love

144
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,320
 rank in your life, what if your wife or husband or

145
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,800
 co-workers or children or

146
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,520
 Teachers or other people in the church or the people you ride public transport with

147
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,480
 What about your domestic workers

148
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,120
 What if they were to speak about your attitude?

149
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,800
 What would they say?

150
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:52,760
 To walk worthy of this incredible calling we've received to represent Christ as his sons and daughters

151
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
 We need humility

152
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,600
 Gentleness

153
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 patience and love

154
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,880
 Now before any of us start thinking and striving or how do I do this? How do I get more?

155
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,600
 I've got to work harder

156
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,000
 I've got to have to get up earlier in the morning and do an extra hour of devotions

157
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,840
 Before any of us start striving and thinking that way

158
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,400
 Let us be reminded to start with the source

159
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
 These qualities come from the heart of God

160
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,560
 Our primary calling is to be

161
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,480
 To be in relationship with God

162
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,960
 The Holy Spirit is great power within us

163
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,960
 Works to transform our hearts so that we will look like Jesus

164
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:50,120
 This is why Paul's prayer comes at the very beginning of his life

165
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:58,840
 Beginning of his letter. He's reminding us that all these qualities come from the heart of God and through

166
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,080
 relationship with him

167
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,600
 When we the people who make up the church

168
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,240
 allow God's humility and God's gentleness and God's patience and

169
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,400
 God's love to flow through us this place will shine

170
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,320
 Shine with unity created by a people who are at peace

171
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,520
 Paul is wanting us to understand the urgency of this the necessity of this

172
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,200
 Because we the church are not the only ones in need of unity and peace

173
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:40,960
 Instead of humility gentleness patience love that results in unity and peace the world is suffering

174
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,160
 There is so much pride

175
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:53,120
 There is so much grasping for power and status and wealth a

176
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,120
 desperate need to control a

177
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:05,520
 Hardness of heart and a love that has become selfish and self-seeking

178
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:13,120
 Paul was urging the early church to endeavor to create the opposite spirit

179
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,560
 our challenge today is to be honest and

180
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,560
 Ask ourselves are we?

181
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,600
 the people of the vine walking in

182
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,040
 humility and gentleness and patience and love

183
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,800
 Is there an opposite spirit in here to what exists out there?

184
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,880
 The word endeavor speaks of trying it speaks of effort and sometimes this is exactly

185
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,840
 What we do in our own strength we try we try we try

186
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:53,200
 Harder to love you know that person in our community group who seems to take up all the oxygen and all the attention

187
00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:00,400
 We try harder to love that co-worker who rubs us up the wrong way

188
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:07,760
 We try we try we try because we know that we're meant to bear with one another in love

189
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:14,720
 We know we're not meant to get angry and frustrated. We feel the pressure. We should be able to do this. We're Christians

190
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:24,920
 Today if you're frustrated and worn out trying to be all things to all people take the pressure off

191
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,600
 Only God has love that has no limits

192
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,680
 Only God has love that has no limits

193
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,120
 But as you lean into him

194
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,560
 He gently draws you towards the other

195
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,640
 in love I

196
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:54,720
 Recently was listening to a podcast and the pastor shared it like this

197
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,880
 he said imagine a wheel of a bicycle and

198
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:05,200
 God is at the center of this bicycle and we are the spokes

199
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
 If I know what a spoke is

200
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,520
 They're those things that those metal

201
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,680
 Want to say wires but

202
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,080
 rods

203
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:22,360
 That go from the outer part of the wheel into the center of the wheel

204
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,200
 we are the spokes as

205
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,680
 We respond to the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives

206
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,160
 We draw closer to God

207
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:38,640
 We draw closer to the center of that wheel and as that happens, we are inevitably drawn closer to

208
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,200
 each other

209
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,920
 With God's help we can endeavor to listen to each other in gentleness and patience

210
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,600
 Instead of promoting our own voices

211
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:58,240
 What areas of your life today lack peace and unity

212
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,520
 What areas of your life lack humility?

213
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,920
 gentleness

214
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,280
 Patience love is it in the area of your family?

215
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,200
 Your friends

216
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,040
 Your community group your work colleagues

217
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,640
 Your future

218
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,200
 Maybe you have no peace when you look at your future

219
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,520
 Maybe today you can choose to once again lean into the center of that bicycle wheel and

220
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,760
 As you are drawn near

221
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,320
 Allow the whispers of the Holy Spirit to show you

222
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,000
 How you can enter back into broken relationships?

223
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,640
 with humility gentleness and love

224
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:57,680
 He can show you how to find ways to look at your future with renewed peace

225
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,280
 Together we can trust once again that unity and peace can be restored to our lives

226
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,080
 Paul reminds us that there is one body and one spirit

227
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:17,320
 Just as you were called to one hope when you were called one Lord one faith one baptism

228
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:23,440
 One God and father of all who's overall and through all and in all

229
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,440
 seven times the word one is used

230
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,680
 When people look at the church

231
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,680
 They should see oneness

232
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:42,080
 This is the state of being unified even though it is made up of many parts

233
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:50,640
 The world is fractured and divided full of people promoting their own agendas at the expense of others

234
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,720
 disunity and anxiety reign I

235
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:02,440
 Recently read an article written by Talia Valley in the fortune magazine and she said

236
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,600
 We are living in an age of selfishness

237
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:13,320
 Many of us notice an increase in selfish behavior during the early days of the pandemic

238
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:19,240
 At the time we may have written it off as a flash in the pan that would subside

239
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,320
 but it hasn't

240
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:30,180
 From rudeness in grocery stores to doors closing in your face rather than being held open by a stranger

241
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,520
 Behavior at a macro level seems to have fundamentally changed

242
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,160
 Living in an apartment block. I see this when you know

243
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:47,000
 There's people in the elevator and the doors are slowly closing and as people still coming and they're like pushing the button like close

244
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 close

245
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,840
 You're laughing you know what I'm talking about

246
00:20:51,840 --> 00:21:01,200
 She goes on to state that psychologists often define selfishness in its simplest form as

247
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,200
 Its focus on the self over and above and even at the expense of others

248
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
 It's a focus on the one

249
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,760
 the one being

250
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,920
 yourself

251
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,360
 God's calling this calling that we've been given to live a life worthy

252
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,560
 His calling calls us to live in a different way

253
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:34,160
 To be that light on a hill that shows Hong Kong that shows the people in our lives a

254
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,720
 different way of living and walking

255
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:44,160
 This oneness in our churches and communities is achieved through close

256
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
 relationships with God that

257
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,320
 produce his qualities of

258
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,080
 humility and gentleness and patience and love in our lives

259
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:59,920
 And it's also achieved by remembering that we are all here because of grace

260
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,520
 Through no effort of our own

261
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,200
 Paul writes to each one of us grace has been given

262
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,480
 There's no hierarchy here

263
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,480
 We are all sons and daughters loved beyond measure

264
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:26,880
 Remembering the grace we walk in the grace we have been given should help us to freely give that same grace

265
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,600
 away

266
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,720
 To live a life worthy of the calling we have received we need each other

267
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,080
 Paul goes on to describe what happens when we all live a life worthy of the calling we have received

268
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,600
 The body of Christ is built up

269
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,360
 We all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God we become mature

270
00:22:52,360 --> 00:23:00,880
 Attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ what a sweet picture of the body of Christ

271
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,920
 When we all choose to allow the Holy Spirit to move us closer to the heart of God

272
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:16,080
 When we deliberately choose to operate out of attitudes of humility and gentleness and patience and love

273
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,840
 This body this church then reflects the fullness of Christ

274
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:28,080
 Becoming the urgent answer of peace and unity the world is seeking

275
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:37,320
 So how do we respond today to this call to walk and live a life worthy of the calling we have received

276
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,440
 Do we respond with more effort and more striving?

277
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,520
 No

278
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
 We respond with more

279
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,920
 surrender

280
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,200
 Surrender to the one who wrote the pages of your life before you were born

281
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,880
 Who can supply you with all the power you need in relationship with him?

282
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,000
 He can shape your heart attitudes to match his own

283
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:13,320
 If you have stalled in your walk because of a sense of unworthiness of not being good enough of

284
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,760
 Not measuring up

285
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,880
 Then it's time to hold on to this truth

286
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,760
 Being able to walk in the calling you have received from God was never about your worthiness

287
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,080
 your ability or your strength

288
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,800
 We walk and live because of his worthiness

289
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:40,080
 Which he has freely given to us. We are draped in his worthiness

290
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,640
 clothed in his robes of

291
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,360
 righteousness

292
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,600
 Our worthiness for this journey we are on has been sorted

293
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,920
 You are good enough

294
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,200
 You are able

295
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,880
 You are strong enough because he has made you so

296
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,200
 However, we do need to partner with God to walk and live out our calling

297
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,280
 Some people have stalled today in your walk because you're waiting for a better time

298
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,320
 When maybe you're more prepared

299
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,720
 More financially stable waiting for more of maybe your flaws to be sorted out

300
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,680
 If you are waiting for perfection or perfect moments

301
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,920
 You'll be waiting forever

302
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,800
 Instead let the Holy Spirit shape your attitudes respond when he convicts you

303
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:41,360
 I'll give you another little story talking about responding when he convicts you

304
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,280
 Once again to do with travel on public transport

305
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,880
 It seems to be the area where God

306
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,760
 rubs his sandpaper over me

307
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:57,360
 so I'm waiting for the e41 which is the bus that takes me most of the way to where I work and

308
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
 Where we line up

309
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,000
 Somebody has kindly put these little chairs that you can sit on

310
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,800
 So the protocol is

311
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:15,360
 You know the first ones there they kind of sit in the chairs and when others arrive they kind of line up behind the chairs

312
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
 You know like in the order that they arrive

313
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,440
 but the other morning I was sitting there and

314
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,080
 all the chairs were filled and there was one lady standing at the end of the chairs, we're waiting for the bus a

315
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,840
 Man rushes across the road and he just stands right at the front

316
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,240
 Like

317
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,160
 In my head like this conversation begins of what I will say to him

318
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,280
 About is he more important than all these other people who were before him

319
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,960
 And in my mind, I'm going through this scenario of like, you know, I should say something to this man

320
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:02,800
 We hop on the bus and he hops on the bus like hops on straight ahead goes ahead of all these people that were there before

321
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,760
 him and I've still got this conversation in my head and I sit down and

322
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,200
 Eventually God goes. Are you just you're just gonna continue doing that like

323
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,240
 having this conversation in your head about what you're gonna say this man and

324
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,560
 God challenged me to look at it with a different spirit

325
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:31,000
 You know, there's a verse in the Bible that says mercy triumphs over judgment and

326
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,600
 That's what I mean when I say

327
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,840
 Respond when God

328
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,280
 Convicts you

329
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,600
 Respond hear his whispers and go. Yeah, I'm wasting all my time and energy on this. I

330
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,040
 Need to pour mercy and grace into this

331
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:03,680
 When he convicts you and asks you to take off or remove things from your life respond

332
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,640
 when he prompts you

333
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,280
 Inevitably in the process you will discover that good works will spill out of your life

334
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:21,240
 Some of you today are struggling with peace and unity because the attitudes you are walking in do not

335
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,440
 reflect the heart of God

336
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:30,640
 Allow God room to get his hands on your impatience your frustration

337
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,760
 your anger

338
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,240
 Those ugly attitudes that dim your light

339
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:45,800
 Some of us here today need to be reminded that to walk and live worthy of the calling we have received we need each other

340
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,920
 Have you ever seen a bicycle wheel with one spoke

341
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,600
 That wheels not going far

342
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,560
 We need each other

343
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,040
 None of this works in isolation

344
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,440
 God works to draw us toward himself and to draw us towards each other

345
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,320
 We are a body and we need every part

346
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,200
 Working together bearing with one another in his love

347
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,280
 Some of us here today are worn out by this walk

348
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:30,760
 You've lost your joy become a bit numb to it all

349
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,000
 I

350
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,560
 Recently was reading a book

351
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,560
 I'm the teacher librarian at my school and I was reading this new book to the children and it was called

352
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,200
 hotel of feelings and

353
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,680
 in one of parts of the book the hotel manager

354
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:54,520
 Makes a statement where she says when I get overwhelmed by all these emotions that come to stay in the hotel

355
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,680
 I go outside and I sit in nature

356
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,240
 And she said and while I just sit there

357
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
 Looking at all the beauty around me

358
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,320
 gratitude comes and sits beside me and

359
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:16,760
 I was reminded of this when I was reading about this or thinking about this weariness that we get in life

360
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:23,040
 Sometimes we have to rediscover our gratitude. We have to sit a while

361
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,320
 Maybe it would be in nature

362
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,320
 Maybe it would be to sit in the first three chapters of Ephesians where Paul

363
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,680
 Outlines just the beauty of what we've received the wonder of it

364
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:43,960
 Oh just sit in it for a while and be reminded and and let gratitude come on sit beside you

365
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,680
 rediscover it

366
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,680
 But also Paul goes on in chapter 5 to say that

367
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,880
 Make sure that you are constantly filled with the Holy Spirit

368
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
 the

369
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,720
 Verb tense he uses in the Greek means go on being filled

370
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:10,640
 You see we might have been filled with the Spirit five years ago or two years ago or maybe even two weeks ago

371
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,840
 But Smith Wigglesworth said we are like leaky boats

372
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,520
 We get filled and then we leak

373
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,040
 This is why Paul I believe was saying

374
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,080
 Go on being filled

375
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,560
 Be filled again our prayer every day being fill me again Holy Spirit

376
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:40,880
 Continue to fill me as I walk into this day if you're weary be filled afresh

377
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,880
 Today

378
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:53,000
 We are going to make space today as we did last week to allow the Holy Spirit to move us closer to the heart of

379
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,720
 God and to each other I just invite the musicians to

380
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,560
 Come up. Would you stand with me?

381
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:13,280
 Would you just close your eyes with me

382
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,680
 If anything I have mentioned

383
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,320
 Has spoken to your heart. I just want you to

384
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
 Open your hands in front of you

385
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:36,560
 And we're just going to give some time for the Holy Spirit to to draw us near to the heart of God

386
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:42,160
 And maybe there's somebody here today you have never

387
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,000
 Started your journey with God

388
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,120
 You've never known that he loves you

389
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
 You've never known that

390
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,440
 He put pen to paper and wrote the pages of your life before you were born

391
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,680
 That there's no one better to lead you in this life than him

392
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:10,080
 If that's you today, then you can hold your hands open in front of you as well and

393
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,040
 choose Jesus

394
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:18,560
 Choose him to be the one that you want to walk your life with and he will come

395
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,560
 and he will stand with you and

396
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:28,960
 He will whisper to you and remind you of how precious you are to him

397
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,720
 For all of us

398
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,480
 I think all of us could open our hands for one thing or another or maybe five things

399
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,240
 As the worship team sing and worship

400
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,400
 And your hands are open in front of you I

401
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:07,040
 Pray that we can be a body together today that we can help meet each other's needs

402
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:16,920
 If there's somebody near you with their hands open I just encourage you to to support them

403
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
 Support them in prayer

404
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:27,200
 Maybe support them with a gentle hand on the shoulder to let them know they're not alone in this journey

405
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,920
 None of us are meant to be alone in this journey

406
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:43,280
 So now we just make some space for the Holy Spirit to draw us closer to the heart of God

407
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
 "I am the Spirit of the Lord" - Jesus Christ, the Lord of Hosts, 1 Cor. 2:17-21.

408
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
 You

409
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
 You

410
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
 You

411
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,000
