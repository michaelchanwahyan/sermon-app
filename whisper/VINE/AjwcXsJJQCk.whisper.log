[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   Well, first of all, I just have to do a shout out for my husband who's unfortunately not
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.480]   very well.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.160]   So, usually he's sat on the front row.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.360]   He's not here, so love you.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.720]   Hello, everyone, and welcome watching online.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.840]   So glad that we can pack everybody in.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.400]   It's so good.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.200]   Well, you know, Christine Gardner, Christine Gardner works here.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:32.420]   She leads our psychotherapist and counseling center Oasis, and she did a staff training
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.680]   for us a number of months ago, and it was on self-care.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.520]   And one of the things that she said to us was, "You will have pain."
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.800]   Not quite what we were expecting for self-care, but she's right.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.220]   Her point was that life is full of pain.
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.960]   We cannot get away from it.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.400]   When we understand that there will be pain and we accept it, we may not like it.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.680]   We certainly don't have to want it.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:14.120]   However, when we understand it will be with us, then our relationship with pain changes.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.440]   It then allows us, rather than to suppress and try and push away pain, it allows us to
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.520]   then think about how we can invite God into the pain that we are experiencing.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.080]   In the same way, life is messy.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.640]   You cannot have a mess-free life.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.680]   It just is the way it is.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.240]   And so we have to accept that there will be mess, but we learn that God is not unfamiliar
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.040]   or surprised by mess either.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.320]   In fact, today we're going to look at how God can be actually found in our mess.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.000]   In our second week of Advent, we look at the messy priest story of the birth of Jesus.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.480]   We look at two characters in the narrative captured in the Gospel of Luke who find themselves
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:19.520]   in deeply messy situations and yet find ways to trust God despite the far from ideal circumstances.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.360]   We'll look at how their stories relate to us, how they teach us that we too can find
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.440]   God in the messiness of our own lives, embrace that mess, and position ourselves for a hopeful
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   future.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.920]   So of the four Gospels, only Luke begins with the story of the birth of John the Baptist,
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.120]   and he introduces us to his father, Zachariah.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.120]   Now Luke tells us some interesting facts about Zachariah to help us characterize the type
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.600]   of man that he was.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600]   First of all, his profession.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.700]   He was very honorable.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.040]   He was a priest, and he belonged to the priestly division of Abijah.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.180]   His wife, called Elizabeth, was also of priestly descent, and they were both described as upright
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.440]   in the sight of God.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.480]   We also learn that they were childless.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.280]   Scripture tells us that Elizabeth was barren, and we knew culturally at that time there
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.960]   was a lot of shame and public disgrace around not being able to have children.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.560]   And then finally we're told that they were old.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.740]   Well actually, Scripture says that they were well along in years, which I think is a much
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.480]   better way of saying they were old, right?
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.160]   So next Luke leads us into the story by setting the scene in the temple.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.560]   The priests bore the responsibility of serving in the temple, offering the sacrifice required
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.200]   by Mosaic law, acting as the mediators between the people and God, and on this occasion we
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.680]   are told Zachariah had been chosen by Lot to enter into the holy place.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.960]   He's there to burn incense, and the offering of incense represented the prayers of intercession
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:21.000]   for all of the people, so it was considered a very sacred task, and for Zachariah an opportunity
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.280]   of a lifetime.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.200]   So while Zachariah was in the holy place, an angel appeared to him.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.880]   Now understandably, Zachariah was afraid, I think I would be too, even though as a priest
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.580]   he would have a sense of awe and trepidation when he's serving, so that would be natural,
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.880]   but this was a fear much, much more.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.800]   He was probably not expecting to encounter an angel on that day.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.200]   But the angel goes on to declare a very positive and personal message to Zachariah, telling
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.480]   him that Elizabeth and his prayers to have a child were about to be answered.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.240]   So let's pick up the story in Luke chapter 1, verses 13 to 17.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.320]   When the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zachariah.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.280]   Your prayer has been heard.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.240]   Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.360]   You are to call him John.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.380]   He will be a joy and delight to you.
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.840]   Many will rejoice because of his birth.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.440]   He will be great in the sight of the Lord.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.680]   He's never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.920]   Spirit even before he is born.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.340]   He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.480]   He will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.920]   the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteousness, to make
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.880]   readier people prepared for the Lord."
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.080]   Wow, what a message.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.800]   You can almost feel the excitement in the angel's declaration that will ultimately
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.660]   prepare the way for the long-awaited Messiah.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:18.600]   But unfortunately, Zachariah's response was not one of joy, but rather disbelief.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.080]   So let's just take a moment to consider this.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.640]   So here is Zachariah.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.640]   He's a Jewish priest.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.080]   We are told he is a good, upright man.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:36.160]   He's standing in the holiest, holy place, and he's carrying out the role of offering
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:43.260]   the prayers on behalf of the people, including his own very personal prayer, and he's facing
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.960]   an angel.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.600]   Now Zachariah knew the Torah, so he would have been very familiar with the story of
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:57.200]   how a heavenly visitation to another elderly couple many years before, Abraham and Sarah,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.760]   who also received a message that they would bear a son who would play an important role
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.880]   in the story of God redeeming a fallen world.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:14.400]   Despite all of this, Zachariah lacked faith, and he doubted God.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.480]   So we have to ask the question, why?
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:25.560]   Had he become hardened over the years of praying for something and waiting and waiting for
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.640]   that prayer to be answered?
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.840]   Can we relate to that?
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.520]   Was he over-familiar with the routine of priestly duties?
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:45.760]   I wonder maybe sometimes we can become hardened to God as our prayers appear to go unanswered.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.160]   Of course we don't stop praying, but do we allow a little bit of disbelief, hinder us
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:59.400]   from truly seeing God, so when he does answer, we possibly miss it?
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.000]   I think for some of us here that have been Christians for a long time, we can find ourselves
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.560]   appearing to trust God on the outside, carrying all the good duties of a good Christian, saying
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:18.360]   all the right things, and yet if we were really honest, we've allowed the years of unanswered
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.760]   prayers, and with that a disappointment in God to take root.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:31.080]   And if an angel were to visit us today, how would we respond?
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.720]   Well, Zachariah's response was, "How can I be sure of this?
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.200]   I'm an old man.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.840]   My wife is long in years."
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:47.720]   Judging by the reply, I don't think the angel was particularly happy about that response.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.720]   The angel said to him, "I am Gabriel.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.320]   I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:04.880]   this good news, and now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.360]   because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time."
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.400]   Ouch.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.520]   The angel is making a point.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.960]   While scripture records numerous visitations of angelic beings, there's only a couple of
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:30.600]   recorded references to their actual names, and here the Hebrew name for Gabriel means
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.800]   God is my strength.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:41.160]   The angel is leaving no doubt in Zachariah's mind that he's been sent directly by God,
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:48.840]   reminding Zachariah of the power of God and his promises that will be fulfilled, and the
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:55.080]   consequences of Zachariah's disbelief, he's struck dumb.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.040]   He's physically silenced.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:05.880]   As Zachariah eventually leaves the holy place, all the expectant people and worshippers outside
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:13.560]   no doubt wondering what on earth happened, they're met with silence from Zachariah.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   The greatest chance for Zachariah to do the job well, and he messes up.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:29.760]   And I imagine he went home with disappointment in himself, silenced not just by the angel,
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.120]   but with a deep sense of shame.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.160]   So let's talk about shame.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.440]   I think we underestimate the power of shame over our lives and how it easily can hold
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.220]   us captive.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:53.280]   According to Brené Brown, a respected professor, author, and researcher for 20 years on vulnerability
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:11:01.000]   and shame, she says, "Shame is the painful feeling or experience of believing that we
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.200]   are flawed, therefore unworthy of love and belonging.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:13.640]   It's the competing, conflicting expectation of who we are supposed to be, and the huge
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:23.440]   weight of expectation we put on ourselves or are put on us by others."
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:29.200]   Shame tells us that we are not good enough and we will never be good enough.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:37.360]   Brown connects the destructive nature of shame to addiction, depression, aggression, bullying,
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.400]   suicide, self-harm, eating disorders, to name a few.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.440]   And the problem with shame is that it is often hidden.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   We don't talk about it.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.920]   We keep it hidden, and then we carry this weight of self-judgment, and then because
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.760]   of that, we get stuck in this cycle of negative behavior that then leads us to more shame
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.320]   and guilt.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.320]   And as Christians, we are not immune to shame.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:19.760]   And I wonder if especially in church communities, the secret, silent, judgmental hold of shame
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:26.360]   keeps us from being truly open and honest with each other.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:34.120]   Are we safe communities that allow people to be vulnerable, to share their stories without
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.440]   fear of judgment?
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:45.640]   Well scripture tells us very clearly, "Therefore there is now no condemnation to those who
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:52.400]   are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus, the law of the Spirit who gives life
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:13:00.980]   has set you free from the law of sin and death and shame."
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:09.280]   So if you are feeling the weight of shame, then today I want to encourage you to break
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:15.480]   the secrecy, the silence, your own judgment.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.920]   Talk to a trusted friend.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.760]   See a pastor, a counselor, a community group leader.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:29.600]   Believe that because of Jesus, we can confess our failures and sins, know that we are forgiven,
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.520]   and shame has absolutely no hold over us.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:47.320]   And as a community, as the Vine Church, could we let's be less judgmental, stop the criticism,
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:57.120]   stop the pretense of perfection, and instead be known for our empathy, our love, and our
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.520]   grace.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:07.080]   Shame has no place in the body of Christ.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:13.240]   When Elizabeth confirms her pregnancy, the shame that Zachariah had doubted could have
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.640]   festered within him.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:21.400]   However, we see that he makes the important decision to choose to be vulnerable, to surrender
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.200]   and trust.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:29.360]   So he decides to obey the angel's instruction, and he's surrounded by his community when
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:37.640]   he names his son John, therefore declaring the hope in a future salvation.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:45.840]   And that shame, along with his silence, is broken.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:53.280]   And sandwiched in this story is another story, and this is the story of Mary, the mother
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.920]   of Jesus.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.600]   I love this painting.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:05.840]   This is by the artist Henry of Sawatonna, because while it's rich in symbolism, it captures
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:12.280]   the vulnerability and simplicity of Mary in her surroundings.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:18.440]   Mary was a young woman, a teenager, in the context of the culture of that time of marriageable
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:25.720]   age, betrothed to Joseph, who was himself a descendant of King David.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.920]   And we're told that the angel Gabriel was sent to Mary.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:39.320]   And when he appears, she too responds with fear, like Zachariah, but unlike Zachariah,
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.720]   her fear is followed by a surrender and a trust.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:50.000]   So let's read from Luke 1, verses 30.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.480]   But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.520]   You've found favor with God.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.160]   You will conceive and give birth to a son.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.140]   You are to call him Jesus.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.640]   He will be great and will be called the son of the Most High.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:10.200]   The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob's
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   descendants forever.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.400]   His kingdom will never end."
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.020]   "How will this be?"
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.240]   Mary asked the angel.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.920]   "Since I am a virgin."
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.840]   The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come on you.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.280]   The power of the Most High will overshadow you.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.000]   So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.040]   Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:43.640]   She who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month, for no word from God
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.360]   will ever fail."
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.240]   "I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.040]   "May your word to me be fulfilled."
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.160]   Then the angel left her.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:01.280]   The 15th century Franciscan priest, Roberto Caratiolo, describes Mary's response to her
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:08.960]   encounter with the angel Gabriel as this emotional journey from this sense of disquiet, of being
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:16.920]   troubled, to a reflection as she's listening, to an inquiry as she begins to question, and
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:24.160]   then to submission as she acknowledges she's the Lord's servant, and later as merit as
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.240]   she is blessed.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:33.680]   But I think it can be too easy to dismiss the intensity of that moment and the range
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:40.640]   of emotions for Mary, especially as we, we're all familiar with her story.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.360]   We're familiar with the outcome.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:51.400]   But Mary, in real time, probably had no idea what the future would bring.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:57.760]   She's described as being deeply troubled, even before the angel had told her what was
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.640]   happened.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:05.480]   Mary probably knew because of her ancestry that being singled out by God was a fearful
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.480]   blessing.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:17.680]   And for us, how often do we in the moment find God's ways sometimes really overwhelming?
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.120]   We too are on this emotional journey.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:28.040]   However, when we can look back, it becomes so much clearer.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:33.840]   So as the angel delivered his message, despite the enormity of what had been shared, her
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.400]   humility and acceptance demonstrated a level of faith and trust in God, even that of beyond
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.420]   a priest.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:51.320]   She was to be the mother of Israel's long-anticipated, long-awaited Messiah, and her life would be
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.400]   turned upside down.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.800]   God's plan for Mary was messy and risky.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:07.600]   The scandal for Mary to be pregnant and unmarried exposed her to the rejection of Joseph.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:14.480]   But as with all God's plans, he controlled the responses of those that mattered.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:20.280]   And in the case of Mary, Joseph became Mary's number one protector.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:26.260]   And we read that Joseph accepted Mary after he too was visited by an angel and trusted
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:31.120]   God despite the social stigma he would also face.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:37.880]   And I love that about God, how he works should be an encouragement to us.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:46.560]   We don't face our difficult, complex, messy situations alone, and God is in control.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:56.240]   I have heard so many stories of messy, difficult, complex, tragic situations, and I have heard
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:06.280]   how God has stepped in and people have encountered that God is with them and in control.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.760]   So what do these stories show us?
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:16.120]   That even in mess, God is at work and God is in control.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:22.040]   Mess for Zachariah was the failure to believe, his physical disability, the embarrassment
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:28.840]   from his fellow priests and worshippers, as well as the shame at having doubted.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:37.040]   Mess for Mary was being pregnant, unmarried, the social ostracism, the judgment, and possible
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.320]   rejection.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:46.360]   Sometimes our choices mean we are responsible for the mess.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:52.320]   If Zachariah had chosen to believe instead of doubt, his story would have been very different.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:57.680]   The angel was very clear in telling Zachariah that because he doubted, he would not be able
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.840]   to speak.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:08.720]   But sometimes we have no control over the mess we find ourselves in, like pregnant Mary
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:16.320]   who had no control over the cultural response of that day and the rejection that could follow.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:25.480]   And just like the characters in these stories, whether we are responsible or not, we can
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.560]   choose how we respond in the mess.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:36.440]   You see, Zachariah eventually chose to see God in his answer prayer, to surrender through
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:45.360]   obediently naming his son John and trusting God as he declared his praise and thankfulness.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:53.240]   Mary chose to see God despite not fully understanding, surrendering herself and trusting God with
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   an uncertain future.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:02.960]   Through both stories, we can learn that how we choose to see God in our mess will lead
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:10.720]   us to surrender and trust and then hope in a future.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:16.120]   So how do these stories become relevant to us?
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:25.120]   A number of years ago, I worked for an organization that provided funding for new companies and
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.680]   injection of capital for those that wanted to diversify and grow.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:35.280]   My job was to interview prospective clients and to prepare a business plan.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:42.240]   And then those business plans would then result in the funding being rejected or approved.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.920]   So I worked for this company for about just under a year.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.100]   And during that time, got very close to all of my colleagues.
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.320]   It was a family run business.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:59.400]   And so even outside of work hours, you know, we would meet up.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:07.400]   Then just a week before Christmas, I arrived into the office and I was told that the company
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   had closed and I was to go home.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:17.800]   Then shortly we found out that actually the company that had been operating had no funding.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.960]   There was no money and it was now under investigation.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.960]   And so I went home also being told that there was also no money to pay the staff.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:34.800]   And so a week before Christmas, we were told we would not get paid.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.440]   It was a messy Christmas.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.960]   I think one of the things that I really struggled with was that knowing I had worked for a company
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.400]   for almost a year and I had no idea.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.600]   And for me, I felt really embarrassed and I felt shame.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:24:02.480]   I'd worked in a company that was responsible for ultimately causing a lot of pain and difficulty
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.160]   for organization and companies.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.720]   And I had no idea.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.140]   People had been deceived.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.600]   There was pain and disruption in that.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.120]   And now I face the harsh reality that also I was out of a job.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.280]   I had no money.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.120]   My husband Richard was studying at the time.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.400]   And so we really didn't know what we were going to do.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:29.240]   But even though I had a lot of questions, because after all, I thought God had provided
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:36.920]   this job for me, the reality was this situation was way out of my control.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.160]   But I could control how I responded to it.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.880]   So I chose to lean into God to try to see him in all of this mess.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.200]   And I asked him a lot of questions too.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.200]   I chose to surrender my fear, my worry, and my shame.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:02.120]   And then I just chose to trust God that he was at work and that he was the hope in my
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.120]   future.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.200]   It didn't make sense to me.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.840]   It didn't have all the questions answered, but I chose to trust God.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.640]   It took about nine months before I got another job.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.680]   During that time, it wasn't easy.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.240]   And I remember we ate a lot of baked beans.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.680]   And if you're from the UK, you will know that is the staple diet if you have no money in
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.560]   the UK.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:36.360]   But even though it wasn't always easy, and sometimes fear would creep in, what if I never
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.800]   get a job again?
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.720]   What if nobody ever hires me?
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:49.440]   All of that, but I had to push through that and keep on trusting that God was with me.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.240]   So eventually I got another job, and that job turned out to be so much better than the
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.680]   other job.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.480]   And eventually it would lead me to here in Hong Kong.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:07.760]   But I had to learn an important lesson, that it was not about me getting a job.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:14.760]   I had to learn that the security of my future was not tied up in my work.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:21.800]   The security of my future was in the redemptive work of the cross that reconciled me back
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:29.160]   into a relationship with God, and then a hope in a future with Jesus where there will be
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:34.240]   no more pain, no more death, no more sorrow.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:42.080]   And this is the hopeful future that Zachariah and Mary saw in the messages from the angel
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:48.640]   that declared the ultimate fulfillment of the promised coming Messiah.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.840]   So what is your mess?
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.240]   And how do you see God?
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:59.000]   Because how you see God will determine how you surrender to him, how you trust him, and
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.320]   where your hope comes from.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:09.560]   A hope that is not based on the changes in circumstances, but a hope that is in the future
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.520]   because this life is temporary.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:19.760]   Our future is secured forever beyond this life because of Jesus.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:27.320]   So the world may appear to be in a mess, complete disorder, but as the stories of Zachariah
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:33.720]   and Mary tell us and as Scripture shows us time and time again, God is no stranger to
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.800]   mess.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:43.560]   He actively uses it to demonstrate his power, his sovereignty, and his love.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:49.080]   And honestly, the world desperately needs to see God right now.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:56.600]   These needless wars raging around us with so much destruction and devastation and loss
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:07.160]   of life that is just not justifiable, the economic decline with rising poverty levels,
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:15.000]   global increase in anxieties and mental health disorders, and here in our city of Hong Kong,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:23.120]   the alarming rise of young people's suicide or attempted suicide.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.720]   The world needs hope.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.320]   Jesus is that hope.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:36.040]   Both Zachariah and Mary knew that the future was in the promised redemption of their people
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.640]   through the Messiah, Jesus.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:45.200]   And they were to play the most important roles in ushering in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:51.960]   Zachariah's son prepared the way for Jesus and Mary gave birth to Jesus.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:58.040]   Jesus is the answer to our world's mess.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:08.480]   But I can't help also wonder at the risk that God took to have Jesus arrive as a baby, totally
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:18.980]   weak and vulnerable, dependent on his mother and earthly father, but also guarded by his
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:28.200]   heavenly father, because our God, our heavenly father, is in control.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:37.160]   So how we see to surrender and trust God is how we live with hope.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.680]   So what does that practically mean for us today?
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:47.600]   Well, we may not be visited by any angels any time soon, or you might.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.760]   I mean, I'm not saying you won't, but don't just rely on that.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.520]   We can still see God.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.080]   We see God through scripture.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.200]   We read a lot about who God is and his character.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.360]   As we learned in our Exodus series, God himself declares his character.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:14.080]   He says, "The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:21.360]   in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands and forgiving wickedness, rebellion
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.980]   and sin."
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:31.680]   We see him through the incarnation of Jesus and the life he recorded in the gospels.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:40.480]   We see God in the world around us, the beauty of nature, the wonder of creation.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:46.440]   Paul refers to this in Romans, "For since the creation of the world, God's invisible
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:53.400]   qualities, his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen, being understood from
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:31:00.800]   what has been made so that people are without excuse."
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.840]   And David also in Psalm 19, "The heavens declare the glory of God.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:11.040]   The skies proclaim the work of his hands."
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:19.580]   We can see in creation around us, in the visible world, all that has been made by God and his
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.200]   invisible power and divine nature.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:30.540]   So take time to watch the sunrise or the sunset.
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:36.600]   Take a walk in the mountains of Hong Kong and see his splendor.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:42.880]   Stand by the sea and watch the beauty and the power of the waves.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.840]   See the beauty of the creatures.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.360]   See God all around you.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:58.400]   And then as we grow in our understanding of who God is, we truly see him, our natural
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:04.240]   response will be we will want to surrender our lives to him.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.200]   Now sometimes that's easier said than done.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.920]   So how can we practically surrender?
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   What does that mean?
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.520]   Well first it has to take humility.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.960]   We need to recognize and accept we need God.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.960]   His ways are so much bigger than our own.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:31.040]   And one practical way that we can take time is to regularly identify areas in our life
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.000]   where we feel we're holding and struggling for control.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.880]   And then confess your need to surrender to God, to surrender whatever it is and allow
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.980]   him to control.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:52.960]   Maybe it's overspending, overeating, drinking too much, challenging family dynamics, difficult
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.200]   work relationships, your job performance.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.840]   Whatever it is that you're desperately trying to control, bring it to God.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:10.400]   Create a habit where you regularly come in prayer to God with confession and surrender.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.960]   Commit to growing your personal relationship with God.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:19.880]   Be committed to a more intimate relationship that involves spending time in prayer.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.000]   Hang out with Jesus.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.880]   Allow the Holy Spirit to guide you.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.400]   Set some time aside that is away from distractions.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.560]   Go for a walk and talk with Jesus.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.360]   Sit and meditate on Jesus.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   Whatever works, find something that works for you.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:46.100]   It takes time and effort, but any meaningful relationship does.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:52.500]   But it's worthwhile the investment of your time because as you spend more time in relationship
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:58.640]   with Jesus, you will see God more and you will want to surrender more.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.960]   You will trust more.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:05.280]   So it's a healthy cycle.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.060]   Life is messy.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:17.020]   So this Christmas, embrace the mess, choose to see God in the mess, choose to surrender
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:27.380]   despite the mess, choose to trust God with the mess, and you will know hope.
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.380]   Can I pray for us?
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.380]   Please, would you stand?
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:45.460]   Father, I thank you for the honor it is to speak today.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:49.100]   I just ask that my words would take root.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:56.140]   The things that are from you, the things that you're wanting to speak to us, that they would
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:05.100]   not return void, anything that is not of you, then may it just disappear.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:11.580]   But Father, my heart is that we would be a people that chooses to have hope in you, God,
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.980]   because we desperately need to see you in the mess.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.540]   I thank you for Jesus.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.860]   I thank you that he is our hope.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.620]   He is our salvation.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:28.780]   And Father, I want to pray specifically for those that are really struggling to see Jesus.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:34.820]   And one of the things that I sensed as I was praying was that there is a spiritual blindness.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:42.500]   You know, as Jesus went in the Gospels, and many of his stories are around healing of
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:48.620]   those that were blind so they would see, there's something significant about that.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:52.780]   For us here today, for some of us, there's a spiritual blindness.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.220]   Some of you know that, some of you don't.
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:36:02.440]   And I believe that Jesus wants to heal us of that spiritual blindness, if you are willing.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:08.700]   And so Father, I pray in the power of the Holy Spirit that you would release people
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:16.500]   from this captivity of spiritual blindness, that they would know what it is to see you,
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.580]   God.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:24.620]   So much of this world overshadows us, puts obstacles in our way, but Jesus, would you
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.540]   remove all that so you would be clearly seen.
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:37.660]   God, we need to see you, because when we see you, we will respond in surrender.
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:43.540]   And I pray for those here that are choosing to surrender more.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:51.140]   I ask that you would give them the courage to sit with you to identify those areas and
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.860]   trust you will be with them.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:37:02.080]   And I pray for anyone who has experienced that captive nature of shame, and I break
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:10.060]   the hold that shame has over us as a church, as a community, as individuals.
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:18.780]   Father, may we respond with empathy towards one another, love and grace towards one another.
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:25.940]   And would we be a people that is free from the hidden shackles of shame.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:30.500]   Our future is in you, God.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.180]   And it is a hopeful, bright future.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.180]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.720]   Amen.
