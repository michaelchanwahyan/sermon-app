1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 In Jesus' name, everyone says, amen, amen, amen.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,400
 Can we thank our worship team as always?

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,840
 And have a seat, have a seat.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,560
 You know, in the last two weeks here at the Vine

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,680
 in our Exodus series, we've been situated

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,200
 in two incredibly important chapters.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,920
 Chapters 19 and 20 of Exodus,

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,400
 which really are a pivotal turning point

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,040
 in the whole narrative of the story.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,840
 Israel is free.

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,800
 God has brought them out of their slavery

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,840
 for over 200 years and has brought them to Mount Sinai.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,920
 And he's brought them to Mount Sinai

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,040
 because he wants to fellowship with them personally.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,720
 He wants to connect with them face-to-face, if you will.

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,400
 And in Mount Sinai, chapters 19 and 20,

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,200
 God begins to redefine the identity of a broken people.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,160
 Because up until that point,

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,400
 Israel was carrying around still their Pharaoh identity.

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,800
 Slavery has stripped them of who they truly are.

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,800
 And God gathered them at Mount Sinai in chapters 19 and 20,

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,960
 and he speaks to them about who they really are.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,000
 Chapter 19, as we saw two weeks ago,

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,560
 he says, "You're a kingdom of priests

25
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,320
 "and you're a holy nation."

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,400
 Israel needed to understand that they had a function

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
 to connect God and the world together.

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,400
 They had a function to walk on behalf

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,160
 of the imitation of God in the world,

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,840
 to be his hands and his feet around them.

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,320
 But they understood they're called a separateness as well.

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
 They're called a holiness,

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,280
 to represent something of the heart of God in this place.

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,120
 And then in chapters 20, as we saw last week,

35
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,960
 we see that God begins to speak to them

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,800
 about how they are to interact with him,

37
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,680
 with themselves, and with one another,

38
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,200
 to form, if you will, a worshiping community.

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,480
 And in chapter 20, we see he gives the 10 commandments,

40
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,920
 as we know of them, these 10 words in the Hebrew.

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,640
 This idea of what it is to love God,

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,720
 to love ourselves, and to love one another.

43
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,000
 And through all of this, what God's trying to do is say,

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 "There's an identity that I want you to hold now

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,440
 "as a free worshiping community."

46
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,120
 And that identity is important

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,040
 because when you come to know yourself as children of God,

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,640
 you can then live out of that identity

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
 in the world around you.

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,800
 God brings them to himself

51
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,960
 so that he can then send them back to the world.

52
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,000
 He had to bring them and purge them

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,560
 out of the brokenness of the slavery of the world,

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,520
 bring them to himself, so that in relationship with him

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,280
 and in receiving their identity in him,

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,440
 they could then go and serve the world,

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
 bring the world into its fruition,

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,360
 by saying there's an alternative way to live,

59
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,200
 that there's a new hope that's found

60
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,120
 in this idea of who God is and his character in the world.

61
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,000
 And what we've been seeing over the last two weeks

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,960
 is it's the same for us,

63
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,560
 that we, the church today, have the same call on us

64
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,320
 that God brings to Israel

65
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,520
 as they're gathered around Mount Sinai.

66
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,280
 We ourselves have been taken out of a place of slavery,

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,880
 the slavery of our sin,

68
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,760
 and we've been brought to Christ Jesus.

69
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,120
 And in relationship with Christ Jesus,

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,360
 our Mount Sinai, if you will,

71
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,720
 we receive the law not written on tablets of stone anymore,

72
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,720
 but by his spirit written on our hearts.

73
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,280
 And out of that, we can now live as a worshiping community

74
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,800
 in the world around us, going out into Hong Kong

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,360
 and saying we believe a church can change a city.

76
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,560
 We believe that God and who he is and his character

77
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,160
 and the narrative he creates for this world

78
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,200
 has something to say to the brokenness of this world.

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,240
 And so we're a sent people.

80
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,560
 And what I wanna talk today about with you,

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,520
 and I'm gonna talk really passionately today,

82
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,280
 so if you don't like passion, I apologize beforehand.

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,000
 But I'm passionate because I'm talking today

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
 about the church.

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,880
 It's the one thing I love the most, the church,

86
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,600
 and all of its frailty and all of its brokenness

87
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,360
 and all of its challenging diversity.

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,720
 The church is God's hope in the world.

89
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,240
 And as we see what happens

90
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,200
 in the next 11 chapters of the story,

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,320
 we see some important things that we need to understand

92
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
 about what it is to be Christ's hands and feet

93
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,400
 in the world that he's planted us in.

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,200
 Chapters 21 to 31 are actually 10 chapters

95
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,880
 where God expands on this idea of what it means

96
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,400
 to be a worshiping community.

97
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,160
 And in there, you see actually three critical things.

98
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,680
 The first in chapters 21 to 24 is a continuation from God

99
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,640
 out of the 10 commandments of how Israel should form

100
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,040
 and work together, how they should love one another.

101
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,280
 And he speaks to them about their social responsibility.

102
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,080
 He speaks to them about their equity

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,520
 that they're supposed to have amongst each other,

104
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
 how they're supposed to handle property

105
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
 and laws amongst themselves

106
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,920
 so that they can truly be an equitable

107
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,760
 and just community in an unjust world.

108
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,760
 And then chapters 25 to 27 and chapters 30 and 31,

109
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,400
 God speaks to them about a new thought.

110
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,760
 He says, I want you to create a place of worship.

111
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,800
 It comes to be known as the tabernacle

112
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,960
 in the rest of the Exodus story,

113
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,400
 in the rest of the Old Testament.

114
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,280
 And the tabernacle essentially was a tent of meaning,

115
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,640
 but it was a complex tent.

116
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,920
 And for a bunch of chapters,

117
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,520
 God speaks about how they are to create this tent

118
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,480
 and the artifacts that are gonna go in that tent

119
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,960
 so that it can become a place of worship.

120
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,200
 So that whilst they're a nomadic community

121
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,520
 and before they go to establish the temple in Jerusalem

122
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,600
 many years later,

123
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,480
 they would have a place to come to to worship their God.

124
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,080
 And then in chapters 28 and 29,

125
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,760
 the third thing God speaks to them about

126
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,400
 is the priestly class amongst them.

127
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,480
 He says, set aside people who can serve in the tabernacle,

128
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,760
 the very people who would eventually go

129
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,040
 and serve in the temple,

130
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,000
 and these ones will serve the worship life

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,960
 of that community.

132
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,980
 And in chapters 21 to 31,

133
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,280
 we see a picture really of God's perception

134
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,280
 of what a worshiping community on earth should look like,

135
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,560
 what the church, if you will, should look like,

136
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,400
 how we should be just and loving and kind and equitable

137
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,120
 amongst each other to model something in the world,

138
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,920
 how we are to know that our identity at its very heart

139
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,800
 is to be a worshiping community

140
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,720
 and what it means to be worshipers on earth.

141
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,160
 And then out of that,

142
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,840
 what it means for us to be a mission focused

143
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,760
 community of people.

144
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,920
 We do not gather every week for 90 minutes in this room

145
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,840
 just so that we can feel good.

146
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,760
 I'm not interested in building a church

147
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
 where you come to feel good.

148
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,580
 Oh, I'm gonna preach on this one for a moment.

149
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,720
 I hope you enjoy coming to the Vine, okay?

150
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,180
 But my purpose is not to preach.

151
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,220
 Our purpose to do what we do here at the Vine

152
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,920
 is not designed just so that you feel

153
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,400
 a little bit better about your life.

154
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,240
 It's designed to change a city.

155
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,860
 And in order to change a city,

156
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,280
 we have to understand what it is that we're called to

157
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,520
 as believers in Christ.

158
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,440
 And so 21 to 31 shows us that.

159
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,000
 But in 32,

160
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,620
 chapter 32 of Exodus,

161
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,700
 we see perhaps what is one of the most horrendous things

162
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,760
 happen in the whole of the Exodus story itself.

163
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,440
 And in what happens to Israel in Exodus 32,

164
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,240
 we see what I would call

165
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,680
 are the three greatest temptations that exist

166
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,680
 for any church to weaken and disempower it

167
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,200
 for the way in which it wants to change

168
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,900
 the society around it.

169
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,320
 Three things in that chapter

170
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,060
 that show us the way in which the enemy is at work

171
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,760
 to disempower and weaken the body of Christ

172
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,360
 for its purposes in the world.

173
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,740
 And so this is why I'm gonna teach passionately today

174
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,960
 because I love the church.

175
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,920
 I love you.

176
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,640
 And I believe the church can change a society.

177
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,640
 But these three things we're looking at today,

178
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,280
 I'm gonna say this upfront,

179
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,800
 are three things that I think we struggle with

180
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,440
 here at the Vine sometimes.

181
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,080
 I think we struggle with these things as a community,

182
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,400
 as a congregation.

183
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,380
 I know that I personally struggle with them

184
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,280
 as a person individually.

185
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,180
 And I wonder as I unpack them,

186
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,080
 whether you might resonate with that a little bit.

187
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,620
 And I think therefore God might wanna do some healing

188
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,960
 and some change and transformation in us

189
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,420
 where we can recognize what the enemy is trying to do

190
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,240
 to disempower us, stand against it,

191
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,160
 so we might truly be Christ's hands and feet in a city.

192
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,080
 Does that sound interesting to anyone here?

193
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,560
 You're right.

194
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
 Wonderful.

195
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,640
 There's one thing that sits behind

196
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,480
 all three of those temptations.

197
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,000
 And it's the one thing that we see happen in Exodus 32.

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,700
 Introduce you to that one thing.

199
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,080
 Let me take you back once again to Mount Sinai.

200
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:48,680
 It is within the shadow of the great Mount Sinai itself

201
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,320
 that the darkest moment of the Exodus story occurs.

202
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,760
 Exodus 32 is a brutal chapter,

203
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,880
 outlining idol worship, sin, burning anger,

204
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,280
 punishment, and even death.

205
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,660
 For the reader of the Exodus narrative,

206
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,740
 it's actually shockingly jarring

207
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,980
 coming off the back of such great chapters

208
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,060
 as Moses' ascent up the mountain

209
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,180
 and the giving of the law

210
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,700
 and his ongoing presence with his people.

211
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,420
 I mean, from the intimacy of God with them

212
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,420
 to his burning anger against their sin.

213
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,260
 Now, all of this is a stark reminder to us

214
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,180
 of one of the most important messages

215
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,060
 of the whole Exodus journey.

216
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,500
 And that's this,

217
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,980
 that so often the most damaging slavery

218
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,340
 that happens to us is the slavery of the heart.

219
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,360
 Egypt had one of the largest

220
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,860
 and most complex pantheons of gods

221
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,740
 of any civilization in the ancient world.

222
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,220
 Over the course of ancient Egyptian daily life,

223
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,020
 hundreds of gods and goddesses

224
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,620
 could be worshipped at any one time.

225
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,320
 These gods were assumed to be present throughout the world,

226
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,620
 capable of influencing natural events

227
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,520
 and the course of human lives.

228
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,020
 So connection with these gods

229
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,140
 was of paramount importance to ancient Egyptians.

230
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,100
 And that connection largely came

231
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,700
 through physical representations of the gods themselves.

232
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,540
 So carvings, statues, amulets, sculptures,

233
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,940
 idols were literally everywhere.

234
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,100
 And the more idols you had around you,

235
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,260
 the better you would be able

236
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,020
 to make a connection to the gods.

237
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,020
 And therefore the better your life

238
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,060
 and the lives of your loved ones would be.

239
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,420
 In modern day Cairo today,

240
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,460
 you can still see so much of this kind

241
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,300
 of ancient idol worship culture.

242
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,540
 These tourist markets in old Cairo are a clear example.

243
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,900
 These various sculptures of Egyptian gods

244
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900
 are done out of the most beautiful turquoise

245
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,060
 found native to this part of the world.

246
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,540
 And while these are of course,

247
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,860
 not designed to be specifically used for worship today,

248
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,140
 they give you the idea of the kinds of gods

249
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,020
 that were constantly on display

250
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,920
 at the time that the Israelites were slaves in this land.

251
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,860
 It should not surprise us then

252
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,500
 that Israel struggled to adapt

253
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,860
 to a new form of spirituality

254
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,940
 as they emerged out of their slavery

255
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,020
 and met with God on Mount Sinai

256
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,380
 and actually received the 10 commandments.

257
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,460
 I mean, think about it from their perspective.

258
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,780
 They had been immersed in an idol worship culture

259
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,380
 for over 400 years.

260
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,820
 And that culture had seeped

261
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,380
 into the very essence of who they were.

262
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,380
 So as Moses took his time on the top of the mountain,

263
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,380
 actually Israel grew itchy.

264
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,940
 They took the gold that they had taken from Egypt

265
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,300
 and they asked Aaron to form for them a golden calf

266
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,620
 so they could worship that as a picture of Yahweh,

267
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,420
 just like they had seen the Egyptians

268
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,300
 form and worship their own gods in Egypt.

269
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,140
 I think it's fascinating how we see in Exodus 32,

270
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,980
 something play out that is actually spiritually significant

271
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,300
 for the whole of the Exodus narrative.

272
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,940
 You see, the Exodus is not so much

273
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,220
 about getting Israel out of Egypt

274
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,860
 as it is about getting Egypt out of Israel.

275
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,180
 And it's the same, of course, for us.

276
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,940
 You see, any journey from slavery to freedom

277
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,020
 is going to require actually the purging from us

278
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,460
 of any of the cultures or the values

279
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,500
 or the habits or the brokenness

280
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,260
 that we embraced in our time of slavery.

281
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,500
 You see, in the formation of the golden calf,

282
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,860
 what actually was happening

283
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,480
 was that Israel was essentially saying

284
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,780
 that despite all the miracles of God

285
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,620
 and all the physical liberation that they had received,

286
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,880
 the chains of slavery and oppression

287
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,740
 were still tightly entangled around their hearts.

288
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,580
 And here is what angered God the most about that.

289
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,260
 They just didn't seem to care.

290
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,620
 I mean, they were happy to live

291
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,320
 with this half-baked kind of freedom

292
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,620
 where they had a little bit of what God wanted,

293
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,900
 but they were still holding onto

294
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,780
 the brokenness of their past.

295
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,380
 So when they fashioned that idol of Yahweh,

296
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,520
 what essentially they were doing unwittingly

297
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,140
 was remaining locked in their previous slavery.

298
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,300
 And isn't it great that you and I

299
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,900
 are so free of all of those idols today?

300
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:12,460
 - I think what I say in that film

301
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,060
 is actually really important for us,

302
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,560
 that it's easy for us to settle with a half-baked freedom

303
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,700
 where we live divided between having elements

304
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,440
 of God's liberation on the one hand

305
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,640
 and yet still holding onto our slavery

306
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,300
 that we've been so accustomed to on the other.

307
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,240
 And we find ourselves divided between these things.

308
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,920
 And that division means

309
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,760
 that we live in this half-baked freedom.

310
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,920
 We experience some of that great release of God,

311
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,480
 and yet we find ourselves so easily entangled still

312
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,800
 in the things that hold us back.

313
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,200
 And what we see in Exodus 32

314
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,220
 is that the key to the things that hold us back

315
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,820
 is this thing called idolatry.

316
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,120
 The second commandment, of course,

317
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,340
 that God gives Moses in chapter 20

318
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,360
 was to have no idols, no images.

319
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,900
 And the very first thing that Israel does

320
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,240
 is that they take an image

321
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,520
 and they create it in order to worship.

322
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,000
 And I wanna show you a few things in this

323
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,600
 because I think there's so much for us to learn

324
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,560
 in our hearts about what it is

325
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,280
 to be a believer, worshiper of God ourselves.

326
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,840
 Let me read to you Exodus 32, verse one.

327
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,480
 It says, "When the people saw that Moses was so long

328
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,140
 in coming down from the mountain,

329
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,640
 they gathered around Aaron and said,

330
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,920
 'Come, make us a God who will go before us.'

331
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,760
 And as for this fellow Moses,

332
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,320
 who brought us up out of Egypt,

333
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,080
 we don't know what has happened to him."

334
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,780
 I want you to notice the thing

335
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,500
 that catalyzes God's people into idol worship.

336
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,640
 It's seen right at the start.

337
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,360
 It says, "When the people saw that Moses was so long

338
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,160
 in coming down from the mountain."

339
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,200
 We actually learn in Exodus 24

340
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,380
 that Moses was for 40 days and 40 nights up on the mountain.

341
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,400
 40 days, 40 nights.

342
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,720
 That's a pretty long period of time.

343
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,040
 And Israel are waiting.

344
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,800
 They thought he was gonna go up, meet with God,

345
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,860
 and come back down, maybe even in the same day.

346
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,200
 But it's been 40 days and 40 nights

347
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,400
 and their expectations have not been met.

348
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,260
 They're anxious about what's happened to Moses,

349
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,240
 their leader.

350
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,520
 They're wondering what's going to happen in their future.

351
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,820
 And it fascinates me that the triggers

352
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,440
 that cause them to move into idolatry

353
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,120
 is essentially unmet expectations and anxiety

354
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,060
 for the future.

355
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,900
 And if you wanna think about what are the things

356
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,400
 that are gonna be the most that will trigger you

357
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,360
 into any form of idolatry in your life,

358
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,040
 it will be impatience, being out of control,

359
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,520
 not knowing what's gonna happen in your future,

360
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,620
 anxiety for what's ahead.

361
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,760
 Those are the key catalysts that draw us

362
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,920
 to try to find something tangible,

363
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,440
 something we can trust,

364
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,800
 something that we can build our hope on

365
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,640
 when the thing that we were building our hope on

366
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,200
 seems so intangible, so distant, so out there,

367
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,040
 and we can't quite control it.

368
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,320
 Are you with me?

369
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,440
 See, the core of idolatry is this desire to control.

370
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,680
 Humanity is really bad at being out of control.

371
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,240
 Well, this hasn't happened on the timeframe

372
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,080
 that I thought it was gonna happen on.

373
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
 He's been up there so long.

374
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,100
 I don't know when he's coming back,

375
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,560
 if he's gonna come back at all.

376
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,200
 So we're gonna take matters into our own hands.

377
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,360
 If you want to get a sense of what the idols

378
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,080
 might be in your life,

379
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,160
 look at what you turn to for comfort

380
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,340
 when you're anxious or disappointed.

381
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,280
 Come on, church.

382
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,280
 I wanna encourage you to do that this week.

383
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,920
 That's gonna be a great devotional time

384
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,880
 for you and Jesus this week, okay?

385
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,240
 Have a think about what are the things

386
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,680
 that you are naturally turning to

387
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,360
 to find comfort and control and security

388
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,240
 when you're feeling anxious, disappointed,

389
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,440
 or your expectations have not been met,

390
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,800
 whether that's from your spouse,

391
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,040
 whether it's from your boss,

392
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,200
 whether it's from God.

393
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,800
 Those things that we turn to to find stability

394
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,120
 when our life is not stable

395
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,040
 is very often the things that we turn into idols.

396
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,280
 You follow that?

397
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,060
 Now, notice what happens here next.

398
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,480
 It says here in this passage,

399
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,280
 this is what they say to Aaron, Israel.

400
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,220
 They say, "Come, make us a God who will go before us."

401
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,600
 Now, this is fascinating.

402
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,140
 The phrase will go before us is the first thing

403
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,360
 that shows us the first temptation

404
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,280
 that I think we are susceptible with here

405
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,580
 that disempowers us as a church.

406
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,280
 They say, "Make us a God who will go before us."

407
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,960
 That phrase, "who will go before us,"

408
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,600
 is a phrase that's been used a lot

409
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,280
 in the Exodus journey so far.

410
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,040
 God's used that phrase about himself so many times.

411
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,560
 You are my people.

412
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,720
 I will go before you and prepare the way.

413
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,040
 I will go before you and prepare a promised land

414
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,600
 that is flowing with milk and honey.

415
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,080
 I will go before you as a pillar of cloud

416
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,760
 and as a fire during the day.

417
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,720
 I will go before you has been a constant phrase

418
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,000
 that God has been speaking about the future,

419
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,520
 the vision, the destiny,

420
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,680
 the purpose of where God wants to take Israel.

421
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,500
 And it's fascinating to me

422
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,520
 that when Israel create a God to worship,

423
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,960
 they use this phrase, "We want this God to go before us."

424
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,520
 In other words, we want this God to now achieve

425
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,640
 what this other God had set up for us.

426
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,760
 You notice this?

427
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,280
 Now, this is really subtle.

428
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,640
 It's really important

429
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,040
 because what Israel is doing

430
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,760
 out of their unmet expectations

431
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,320
 and out of their anxiety for their future,

432
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,640
 they're basically saying, "We have God's promise,

433
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,400
 "but we're not happy that that promise is not coming through

434
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,440
 "how we were expecting it to come through.

435
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,300
 "So we're now going to do it in our way."

436
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,520
 This is the idolatry of the self.

437
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,920
 This is saying that I am better

438
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,280
 than what God is going to do.

439
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
 But notice they still want what God wants.

440
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,920
 So at its very,

441
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,360
 listen to this, church, this is really important.

442
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,820
 At its very core, identity.

443
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,600
 Identity is the decision in our lives

444
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,280
 to basically in the flesh accomplish something

445
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,480
 that God started in the spirit.

446
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,960
 Come on, church.

447
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,900
 That at its very heart is what idolatry is all about.

448
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,000
 It is the desire and the decision

449
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,800
 to accomplish, to finish in our flesh

450
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,400
 something that God has started in His spirit.

451
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,920
 And for some of us, it started well.

452
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,600
 It started out, God spoke to us.

453
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,320
 He gave us a call, He gave us a vision,

454
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,360
 He gave us some hope.

455
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,200
 And we began out of that place of the spirit

456
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,840
 to believe and to pray and to align our priorities

457
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,640
 towards the thing that God had said.

458
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,700
 But over time, when our expectations got unmet,

459
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,080
 when we became anxious about our future,

460
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,480
 where things didn't seem to happen

461
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
 how we quite thought they were gonna happen,

462
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,280
 it is so tempting for us to finish in the flesh

463
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,840
 the thing that God started in the spirit.

464
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,000
 It is very tempting for us to essentially create

465
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 an Ishmael process for an Isaac promise.

466
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,360
 Are you with me?

467
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,840
 And this is exactly what they're doing here.

468
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,280
 And they're doing it out of that place of fear,

469
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,920
 out of that place of not knowing,

470
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,840
 out of that uncomfortable, not being able to control,

471
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,800
 I'm gonna finish in my flesh

472
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,200
 what God has started in His spirit

473
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,080
 'cause I'm tired of waiting.

474
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,160
 Some of you in this room,

475
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,280
 you're trying to finish in your flesh

476
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,040
 something that God has promised you

477
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,760
 'cause you're upset that God hasn't done it

478
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,400
 in the way you thought it was going to be done.

479
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,040
 This is not a new problem for the church.

480
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,100
 This was a problem that existed

481
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,240
 right at the start of the church.

482
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,400
 Paul, writing to the church in Galatia,

483
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,160
 he said it this way in Galatians 3.3.

484
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,360
 Let me read this to you.

485
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,120
 "Are you so foolish?

486
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,160
 "After beginning by means of the spirit,

487
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,080
 "are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?"

488
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,360
 See, the idolatry of self is one of the most

489
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,540
 powerful idolatries that the enemy brings the church.

490
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,640
 And I wanna, as your pastor, be honest with you about this.

491
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,640
 This is the idolatry I see the most in me.

492
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,760
 As your leader, the idolatry I see the most in me

493
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,680
 is me trying to finish in my flesh

494
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,520
 what God has begun here at the vine.

495
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,880
 And I know, by the way, this week I'm celebrating,

496
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,200
 this week is the end of my 10th year as senior pastor here.

497
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,440
 I became senior pastor November 1st, 2013.

498
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,480
 And I know over those last 10 years

499
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,360
 that I have on a number of occasions

500
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,840
 created a golden calf and held it before you

501
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,800
 as I tried to finish in my flesh

502
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,000
 what God has started here in his spirit.

503
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,440
 And I can tell you this from firsthand experience,

504
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,680
 it is exhausting to do that.

505
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,840
 The irony is is that anxiety draws us

506
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,000
 into taking matters into our own hands.

507
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,780
 But when you take the things of the spirit

508
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,440
 into your own hands and try to finish them in the flesh,

509
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,880
 it only creates more anxiety in you.

510
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,480
 And see, the enemy's strategy over you is this.

511
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,160
 He wants to disempower God's work in your life

512
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,600
 by turning the very good things of God

513
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,880
 that God has put in your life and started in your life

514
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,160
 and turn them into exhausting and tiring things

515
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,360
 through his work in you.

516
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,920
 You know, it should sober us to realize

517
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,680
 that one of the great strategies of the enemy

518
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,640
 is actually to take the promises of God

519
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,600
 that are designed to set us free

520
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,960
 and through the worship of self,

521
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,640
 turn them into shackles that exhaust and bind us.

522
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,080
 Listen to this, church.

523
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,720
 This is what the enemy wants to do.

524
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,960
 Take the very good promises of God,

525
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,100
 the things that God has put in us to set us free,

526
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,840
 and through the worship of self,

527
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,040
 through the driving of trying to achieve

528
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,160
 what only the spirit can achieve,

529
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,560
 we will essentially burn ourselves out.

530
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,360
 And the very gifts and the promises of God

531
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,600
 become shackles that exhaust and bind us.

532
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,200
 And if you feel a little bit like that today,

533
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,360
 right at the end of our time together,

534
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,920
 I'm gonna share something that I believe

535
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,560
 can help to set you free.

536
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,800
 But I wanna show you the second great temptation.

537
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,040
 Is this helpful still so far for some of you?

538
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,640
 Here's the second temptation.

539
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,560
 Aaron then answered them.

540
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,800
 Verse two, "Take off your gold earrings

541
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,640
 "that your wives, your sons, your daughters are wearing

542
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,760
 "and bring them to me."

543
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
 So all the people took off their earrings

544
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,480
 and brought them to Aaron.

545
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,400
 He took what they had handed to him

546
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,560
 and he made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf,

547
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,320
 fashioning it with a tool.

548
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,160
 Fascinating.

549
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,880
 So Israel says, "We want an idol."

550
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,480
 Aaron, who's the de facto leader in Moses' absence says,

551
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
 "All right, well, take off all the earrings,

552
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,520
 "all the gold that you had taken from Egypt.

553
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,080
 "Take that off, give it to me.

554
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,200
 "I'm gonna melt it down.

555
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,640
 "I'm gonna put it in this iron cast.

556
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,600
 "I'm gonna create a golden calf."

557
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,000
 Essentially a bull, a young bull.

558
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,560
 "I'm gonna create that and that's gonna become our idol."

559
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,080
 Now, the context to this is really important

560
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,920
 because back in Exodus 24,

561
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,640
 God had spoken from 25 to 27 and then 30 and 31,

562
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,680
 God had spoken to him about the creation of the tabernacle.

563
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
 And God had said to Moses,

564
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,240
 "We're gonna create this place of worship

565
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,760
 "called a tabernacle that the people are gonna come to

566
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,200
 "to be able to worship me."

567
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,800
 And he said, "In the construction of this tabernacle,

568
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,600
 "I want you to take the gold

569
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,200
 "that you had plundered from Egypt

570
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,760
 "and I want you to use that to shape a place of worship,

571
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,600
 "a tabernacle.

572
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,960
 "And this tabernacle will be so glorious

573
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,480
 "because it will be filled with gold and jewels

574
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,080
 "and it will speak of my might and my power and my glory.

575
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,960
 "It will be a reminder to you of the things

576
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,040
 "that I have done in Egypt

577
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,240
 "and the freedom I've brought you.

578
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,120
 "This place of worship will lead you

579
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,800
 "into the ability to worship me.

580
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,480
 "Take the gold and fashion a place of worship."

581
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,920
 Are you following that?

582
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,240
 Now, interestingly in the Hebrew,

583
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,720
 the very same word that Aaron uses here in 32

584
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,600
 for making and taking the gold and making the idol

585
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,360
 is the same word God uses in those chapters

586
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,080
 to talk about making a place of worship.

587
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,280
 And in this, you see one of the most powerful,

588
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,200
 one of the most destructive idolatries

589
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,640
 that can happen in the church today.

590
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,480
 And this is it.

591
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,560
 It happens when we take our place of worship

592
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,320
 and turn it into our object of worship.

593
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,360
 Oh, I'm gonna have to preach on this one for a moment.

594
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,360
 In taking the gold that should have been put aside

595
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,840
 for the creation of a place of worship,

596
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,000
 Israel takes that gold and they fashion a calf

597
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,280
 as an object of worship.

598
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,120
 And when we as a church today take the very thing

599
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,200
 that was created by God as a place of worship,

600
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,040
 a place that makes us come so that we can worship Yahweh,

601
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,760
 and we twist it and turn it

602
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,400
 and we make the place an object of worship,

603
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,160
 then we've entered into one of the most destructive forms

604
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,560
 of idolatry there is,

605
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,720
 and we have disempowered the church

606
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,200
 for its witness in the world.

607
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,760
 So when we come in here on a Sunday

608
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,720
 and we come in with the intention

609
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,000
 of enjoying experience together,

610
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,600
 which is higher and more valuable to us

611
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,640
 than the God behind that experience,

612
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,240
 we've entered into idolatry.

613
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,800
 When we come in here excited to sing songs

614
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,000
 and to worship together

615
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,760
 and to fill an experience of worship together

616
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,440
 that we think is better than anything else

617
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,560
 that we've ever experienced,

618
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,280
 and we come excited for that experience of worship,

619
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,800
 and we don't think about the God behind that worship,

620
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,360
 we have entered into idolatry.

621
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,880
 When we come in here and we pay lip service to our sin,

622
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,480
 when we ignore the conviction of sin

623
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,280
 that God brings into our heart

624
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,560
 through our ability to gather into worship like this,

625
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,240
 when God speaks to us and we pay lip service to it,

626
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,400
 and we don't really react to it,

627
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
 we don't really respond to it,

628
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,800
 we don't really repent to it,

629
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,960
 we've entered into idolatry.

630
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,240
 We've made the place of worship our object of worship.

631
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:07,480
 I believe that the church is God's gift to change a world,

632
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,240
 but let me be really clear about this,

633
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,420
 there is no power in this building.

634
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,320
 There is no power in the chairs you're sitting in,

635
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,600
 in this lights that you see here,

636
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,240
 there's no power in the skill of our musicians,

637
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,920
 there's no power in the words that come from my mouth.

638
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,120
 The only power that there is, is the power of Jesus.

639
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,680
 And if we come into church and we fail to worship

640
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,640
 where the power truly lies,

641
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,280
 and we worship a subset of that power,

642
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,720
 and we in our human sin make the subset of the power,

643
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,560
 the power that gets to be worshiped,

644
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
 then we need to repent.

645
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,600
 Then we are so caught up in idolatry

646
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,640
 that we have disempowered the effectiveness of the church.

647
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,320
 They take the gold and they fasten an object of worship

648
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,000
 when they should have been using that gold

649
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,600
 to create a place of worship.

650
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
 Let me encourage you with this,

651
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,800
 take the gold that is inside of you

652
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,560
 and create a place of worship.

653
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,600
 Here's the third thing.

654
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,800
 They say at the end here in verse four,

655
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,520
 then they said this, "This is your God, O Israel,

656
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,160
 "who brought you up out of Egypt."

657
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,400
 This is really fascinating to me.

658
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,160
 The third thing they do in this process of idolatry

659
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,040
 is that once the golden calf is then presented

660
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,160
 before the people, they say these words

661
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,360
 to the whole of Israel, "This is your God."

662
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,920
 And they actually then define who this God is.

663
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,000
 They say, "This is the God who brought us up out of Egypt."

664
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,040
 Now this is really interesting

665
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,160
 because the God that brought them up out of Egypt

666
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,080
 is what God?

667
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,720
 Yahweh.

668
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
 Yahweh has brought them out of Egypt.

669
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,280
 So they present this calf and notice what they do.

670
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
 They present this calf

671
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,840
 as the physical earthly representation of Yahweh,

672
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,680
 which is really interesting

673
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,760
 'cause we think idolatry by its definition

674
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,320
 is the exchange of worship of one God

675
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,080
 for the worship of a completely different God.

676
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,720
 But actually the most destructive and subtle

677
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,240
 and most powerful form of idolatry

678
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,000
 is not exchanging the worship of Yahweh

679
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,520
 for the worship of something else.

680
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,520
 It is reducing who Yahweh is into a golden calf.

681
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,160
 They've said, "This is the God who brought us out of Egypt."

682
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,760
 Well, we're not comfortable.

683
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,360
 We're not happy with God being distant

684
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,240
 and in a cloud on a mountain.

685
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,440
 We want a God who we can see, who we can physically hold,

686
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,520
 who we can reduce down into something that we can understand.

687
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,320
 We wanna domesticate God, Israel says.

688
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,200
 And the greatest idolatry that happens in the church today

689
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,040
 is the domestication of God.

690
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,440
 It is fashioning a God who fits within our comfort levels.

691
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,000
 And when we fashion a God who fits within our comfort levels,

692
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 we have basically exchanged God for a changed God.

693
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,120
 For over 15 chapters,

694
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,480
 God has been showing himself to Israel

695
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,600
 in might and power, in the plagues,

696
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,360
 most of them which weren't pretty

697
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,720
 and were quite uncomfortable,

698
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,960
 in the reality of the parting of the sea,

699
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,520
 and a God who can hold all creation in his hands.

700
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,720
 And then they come to Mount Sinai to personally meet with God

701
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,200
 and now they witness a God who's thunder and lightning,

702
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,920
 who shakes the ground around them,

703
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,480
 who Moses goes up and disappears into a cloud

704
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,160
 and is up there for 40 days and 40 nights.

705
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,600
 And in all of that, Israel is thinking to themselves,

706
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,200
 "I'm not sure I can handle this kind of God.

707
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,040
 I'm not sure if I fully understand this kind of God.

708
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,480
 This God is not controllable.

709
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,200
 This God is somewhat unpredictable.

710
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,520
 This God is so powerful

711
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,240
 that it is beyond my understanding of what power is

712
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,600
 and I'm not comfortable with that.

713
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,800
 So I will take the gold and I will fashion God down

714
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,320
 into something that I can comfortably understand,

715
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,960
 grasp, control."

716
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,360
 The greatest idolatry you will ever do

717
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,280
 is to recast God into something you can handle.

718
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,280
 God is not to be handled, he's to be worshiped.

719
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,800
 Come on, church.

720
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,160
 And if we at the Vine, if we do our best

721
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,840
 to try to place God into some comfortable box

722
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,320
 that we've always known Him in,

723
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,760
 in the last 30 years of our existence as a church,

724
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
 God is constantly wanting to try and break out

725
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,760
 of the expectations and the molds that his people put Him in.

726
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,720
 That doesn't mean that we can't know Christ.

727
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,440
 Of course we can know Him and we can see His character

728
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,520
 and we can trust what the Word says about Him.

729
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,000
 We can find ourselves rooted in comfortable ideas

730
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,760
 of theology and knowing who He is.

731
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,320
 All that is absolutely true.

732
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,360
 But the temptation the church has,

733
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,360
 what I think the enemy does in trying to push the church

734
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,360
 is to say, "We want a God who is always comfortable."

735
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,040
 One of my favorite theologians and writers

736
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,880
 in the 21st century is C.S. Lewis.

737
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,520
 If you've never read any of C.S. Lewis's stuff,

738
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,160
 I can't recommend it more.

739
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,000
 There's this incredible book that he wrote,

740
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,840
 one of his most famous,

741
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,520
 "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"

742
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,840
 where he writes about these children

743
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,760
 who find this wardrobe in their uncle's house

744
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,840
 and they go through it into this incredible land

745
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,200
 called Narnia where there's a fight

746
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,160
 between good and evil happening.

747
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,680
 C.S. Lewis writes it in such a way

748
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,880
 to present what the kingdom of God is like.

749
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,640
 There's a lion in this particular Narnia

750
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,280
 who is the representation of Jesus Christ.

751
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,880
 Then there's all these other animals who talk.

752
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,160
 It's a fantasy thing.

753
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,180
 There's all the animals that talk.

754
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,000
 These three children go into that land

755
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,560
 and they discover a world that they didn't know.

756
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,800
 There's this one moment where Susan, one of the children,

757
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,760
 is talking to a beaver.

758
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,600
 The beaver's talking.

759
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,400
 Yes, it's fantasy.

760
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,560
 And they're talking together.

761
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,600
 I want to read this part to you.

762
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,480
 It says this.

763
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,960
 This is the beaver speaking.

764
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,640
 As then is a lion, the lion, the great lion.

765
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,240
 Oh, said Susan, I thought he was a man.

766
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,200
 Is he quite safe?

767
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,520
 I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion.

768
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,120
 Safe, said Mr. Beaver.

769
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,680
 Who said anything about safe?

770
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,600
 Of course he isn't safe, but he's good.

771
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,440
 He's the king, I tell you.

772
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,960
 When a church tries to domesticate God

773
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,960
 and make him safe, we've made a golden calf.

774
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,680
 He's not safe, but he is good.

775
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,600
 And his goodness, his goodness is what changes a city,

776
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,120
 not his safeness.

777
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,200
 God is not Gandalf on a cloud.

778
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,620
 He's a refining fire in our hearts.

779
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,780
 That's who he is.

780
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:35,520
 And so these three things, these three temptations

781
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,820
 towards idol worship that I think every church faces,

782
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,440
 the temptation to exchange God, to change him

783
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,320
 and to make him into a way that we understand him,

784
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,920
 the temptation to finish in the flesh

785
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,440
 what God has started in his spirit,

786
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,800
 the temptation to think that we are the ones

787
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,400
 that can accomplish it and not him,

788
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,960
 these temptations that sit behind us

789
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,920
 and with us all the time.

790
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,640
 We have to purge these from us.

791
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,280
 If we're truly going to be a church

792
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,520
 that can change our city.

793
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,880
 And the question we have to ask is where's the hope?

794
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,600
 Where's the hope in this?

795
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,280
 Well, the hope in chapter 32 is that Moses

796
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,080
 sees what's happening and God shows him

797
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,240
 what's happening in the idolatry.

798
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,600
 And Moses petitions and intercedes with God

799
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,980
 and God changes his heart and doesn't do

800
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,880
 what he said he's gonna do to his people.

801
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,280
 We don't have time to look at that today,

802
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,920
 but we have one more powerful than Moses

803
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,040
 that is standing in the gap for us in our idolatry

804
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,760
 and that's Jesus.

805
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,720
 And Jesus comes before the Lord on behalf

806
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,280
 of the church today and intercedes on our behalf

807
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,120
 and stands in the gap for us and says

808
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,340
 that I am the only image you will ever need.

809
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,400
 That in Jesus Christ who has become flesh for us,

810
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,840
 he has shown us the fullness of who God is.

811
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,360
 And while there is still mystery and wonder

812
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,400
 and power and the unimaginable that is in God,

813
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,480
 which is a beautiful thing, in Christ,

814
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,480
 we get to see what God is truly like.

815
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,020
 God is saying, I understand that you need something

816
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,560
 that is tangible to you.

817
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,720
 So the incarnation, fully God, fully human,

818
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,040
 is the most tangible expression

819
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,320
 that we could ever have of God.

820
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,480
 We no longer need the idols of golden calves

821
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,840
 because we have the person of Jesus Christ.

822
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,120
 And when Paul speaks of that hope to the church,

823
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,920
 he is trying to shift them from their idol

824
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,760
 worshiping temptations that are there to disempower them

825
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,040
 and set up for them a worshiping,

826
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,200
 Jesus-centric church community.

827
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,760
 And I wanna finish by showing you his vision

828
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,440
 of such a community.

829
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,440
 This is found from Colossians 1:15.

830
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,840
 He, speaking of Jesus, is the image,

831
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,960
 notice how he talks about it,

832
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,440
 is the image of the invisible God,

833
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
 the firstborn over all creation.

834
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,320
 For by him, all things were created,

835
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,840
 things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,

836
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,240
 whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities,

837
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,600
 all things were created by him and for him.

838
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,920
 He is before all things,

839
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,360
 and in him all the things hold together.

840
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,480
 And he is the head of the body, that's the church.

841
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,200
 He is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead,

842
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,960
 and that in everything he might have the supremacy.

843
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,040
 For God was pleased to have, notice this,

844
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,560
 his fullness dwell in him,

845
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,080
 and through him to reconcile to himself all things,

846
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,400
 whether things on earth or things in heaven,

847
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,160
 by making peace through the blood shed on the cross.

848
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,480
 Once you were alienated from God

849
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,720
 and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior

850
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,920
 but now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body

851
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,800
 through death to present you holy, notice this,

852
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,480
 in his sight without blemish and free from accusation.

853
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,120
 That's our hope being freed from idolatry,

854
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,040
 that we can stand before Christ because of Christ,

855
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,480
 holy in his sight without blemish and free from accusation.

856
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,240
 If you continue in your faith, established firm,

857
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,400
 not moved by the hope held out in the gospel.

858
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,240
 This is the gospel that you heard

859
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,720
 and that has been proclaimed to you,

860
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,480
 every creature under heaven,

861
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,720
 and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.

862
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,640
 In other words, Paul's saying, see Jesus.

863
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,840
 If you want an idol, if you want an image,

864
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,120
 if you wanna look towards something that's tangible,

865
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,600
 see Christ because in Christ,

866
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,760
 he has reconciled all things to himself

867
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,080
 and if the church lays down its worship of worship,

868
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,480
 its worship of preaching,

869
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,160
 its worship of being relevant in the world

870
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,400
 and turns back to the worship of Jesus,

871
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,520
 we will find where the power truly lies

872
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,840
 to change the city that we so long for.

873
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,720
 Oh, I love the church

874
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,340
 but I also recognize the way in which the enemy is at work,

875
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,680
 even against us here at the Vine.

876
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,180
 May we, as individuals and as a community,

877
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:02,000
 deal with the idols that we're tempted to embrace

878
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,100
 and as we come to Christ to deal with those idols,

879
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,320
 may he empower us for the work that he has for us.

880
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,720
 Would you stand with me?

881
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,320
 And I wanna pray over you

882
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,760
 and I wanna commission you into this work

883
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,300
 and maybe if you're comfortable,

884
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,280
 you could just open your hands as I pray for you.

885
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,920
 Father, in this room,

886
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,300
 there are many things that we hold in our hearts

887
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,140
 in this moment.

888
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:37,320
 Those things are on the individual level in every heart

889
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,680
 and those things are on the community level

890
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,840
 within the church body.

891
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,760
 And Lord, we're grateful for this community of faith,

892
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,600
 for the Vine.

893
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,420
 And we're grateful that you've called us

894
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,920
 to be community together here.

895
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,180
 We're grateful for every person in this room

896
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,480
 that calls the Vine their home church in Hong Kong.

897
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,940
 And Father, we believe in the power of the church,

898
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,020
 not in the power of a building,

899
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,260
 in the power of programs,

900
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,660
 in the power of Jesus Christ

901
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,320
 who is alive in the church today.

902
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,660
 And Father, we want that power to be seen in Hong Kong

903
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,940
 in this time, in this hour like never before.

904
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,340
 Lord, we pray that you would purge your church.

905
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,760
 Lord, that's a powerful prayer.

906
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,460
 We pray that you would purge the Vine

907
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,900
 of the idols that it holds,

908
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,780
 that you would show me and the other leaders here

909
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,900
 what those idols are

910
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,100
 and bring us to our knees in repentance.

911
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,380
 You would show our elders what those idols are

912
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,740
 and you would bring the elders to their knees in repentance.

913
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,540
 You would show individuals in this church

914
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,020
 what those idols are

915
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,220
 and that they would humbly submit them

916
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,340
 to the leadership here to repent and pray through.

917
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,660
 Father, we come corporately to you in this moment,

918
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:00,220
 recognizing that we are sinners

919
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,620
 and therefore there is idolatry amongst us.

920
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,540
 But recognizing your grace and your goodness,

921
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,340
 that we can stand before you, as the scriptures say,

922
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,900
 without blemish or accusation.

923
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,740
 Thank you for the blood on the cross of Jesus

924
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,980
 that does that for us.

925
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,060
 And Father, I pray for every individual here too.

926
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,540
 And I want you to take a moment just between you and God

927
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,340
 to allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you

928
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,380
 of any personal idols that you may hold.

929
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,700
 And as he shows you these things,

930
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,660
 it's not to condemn you,

931
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,620
 it's to invite you into great freedom.

932
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,060
 It's perhaps to even pull back the curtain

933
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,660
 and reveal to you a way in which the enemy

934
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,740
 is trying to hold you back

935
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,820
 from all that God has promised for you.

936
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:55,140
 And our individual idols

937
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,340
 are things that we now bring to God in knowledge

938
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,780
 that in Christ, in his death and resurrection,

939
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,860
 we find freedom, that we can repent.

940
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,860
 I wanna invite you into a place of repentance this morning.

941
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,460
 (gentle music)

942
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,140
 Let's not pay lip service

943
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,780
 to what the Holy Spirit shows us individually today.

944
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,900
 Take a moment.

945
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,580
 All you have to do is say,

946
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,220
 "Lord, I bring this thing of my life to you,

947
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,740
 "and I don't know how to handle it.

948
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,060
 "I don't know how to finish it.

949
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,100
 "I don't know what to do, Lord, but I confess it,

950
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,220
 "and I ask you to take it from me.

951
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,100
 "I ask that you forgive me for the idolatry

952
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,100
 "that I'm holding in this particular place

953
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,220
 "in my life right now."

954
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,820
 (gentle music)

955
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,220
 Come, Holy Spirit, come.

956
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,740
 Cleanse your church.

957
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:52,780
 Purge us, Lord, of the things that shackle and bind us again,

958
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,660
 things that drag us back into slavery.

959
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,100
 Come, Jesus, come.

960
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,140
 Jesus, come.

961
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,740
 (gentle music)

962
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,240
 (music fades)
