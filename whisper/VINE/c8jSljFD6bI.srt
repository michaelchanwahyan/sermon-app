1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 >> [APPLAUSE]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 >> You do a wonderful job service leading us.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Well, when I was in my mid-20s,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 I actually really struggled a lot with receiving God's love,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 and really believing that he forgives me,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 that he forgives me for my failures.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 And so I was really stuck in this shame.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I was very focused on this gap from where I was and where I wanted to be,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 and that was just very present before me.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 So I don't know if anyone here can relate to that,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 if you experienced that, that you felt that.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And perhaps it's some specific sin,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 a big thing that happened a long time ago

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 that just sort of is like a cloud hovering over your head.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Maybe it's like accumulation of just things where you know you're not who you want to be,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 and it's just hanging there.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 But you know what happens when we feel this way,

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 when we struggle to receive God's love,

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 when we struggle to receive his forgiveness,

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 it actually is hard for us to just be free to worship him,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 to enjoy him, to praise him, to live a life to serve him.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Right? I think so.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So what I want to do with you today,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I want to explore with you a question,

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 and here's the question.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 How can we experience freedom and encouragement to worship God wholeheartedly?

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 How can we be set free from this cloud that might be hanging over you,

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 that's weighing you down,

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 so you can enjoy God and be just free to bring him glory,

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 to worship him,

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 and that you can just live in this love of God,

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 that you can just move in that,

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 that you know you are loved,

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 that you can know, in honor of Francesca,

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 that you are beautiful,

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 that God has made you,

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 and when he created us, he said that humans are very good,

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 and he restores us,

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 he brings wholeness to us,

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 and so he desires for his people,

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 for us as a church family,

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 but also for you as an individual,

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 just be free to worship him,

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 to praise him,

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 to love him with your life,

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 to love him back for all that he has done.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Now we're going to explore this question of how we can move into this freedom,

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 and into this encouragement,

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 we're going to explore that by looking at the book of Hebrews.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Now Hebrews, I want to just set a little bit of context before we go into more detail,

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 and of course there's a joke about Hebrews, coffee, and all that,

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 but I want to set a little bit of context for this,

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 and so the book of Hebrews was written to a Jewish Christian community,

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 and actually uses a lot of things that Jewish people would be familiar with,

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 which for us maybe were a little bit more removed,

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 especially if we're not that familiar with the Bible,

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 so it takes a little bit more work to perhaps understand everything that the author is saying,

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 and what the author of Hebrews does,

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 he actually spends a lot of time explaining the significance of Jesus' sacrifice,

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 and Jesus' priesthood,

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 and then unpacks the implications of that,

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 and actually after he has done that for six chapters basically,

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 that's the part where we're going to pick up,

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 so he's just spent forever,

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 like a very long time unpacking the significance of Jesus' sacrifice,

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 for the forgiveness of our sins,

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 and Jesus' priesthood, that he is our high priest,

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 and then it goes into this passage,

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 so let me take you to Hebrews 10,

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 we're starting in verse 19, it says this,

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 "Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of Jesus,

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 by a new and living way open for us through the curtain that is his body,

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 and since we have a great priest over the house of God,

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with full of assurance that faith brings,

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 having a heart sprinkled to cleanse us from guilty conscience,

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 and having our bodies washed with pure water.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess,

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 for he who promises is faithful.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And let us consider how we may spur one another on towards love and good deeds,

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 not giving up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing,

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the day approaching."

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Now, one of the crises that the author of Hebrews is addressing

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 is actually that part of that Jewish-Christian community,

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 that they were starting to stop meeting with one another.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 They started to stop gathering.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 It was becoming a habit. Actually, it was 25, if you look at it.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 He's saying to not giving up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 So that's part of his encouragement to them.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Now, what leads us to stop meeting together?

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Well, for some of us, maybe we just wonder what's the relevance about getting together in church here on a Sunday morning.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 I could go fishing. I could sleep on a Sunday morning, watch Netflix.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Everybody has their own thing. Why gather? Why come together?

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Why is this important? Why is this significant?

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 For others of us, as I was sharing earlier, when I was young, I struggled with feeling forgiven,

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 and I just had this sin and shame hang over me.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And so when I came to church, it kind of reminded me of that.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 So there was also a little bit of a hindrance by that.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 It didn't feel good to come because of where I was myself.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 For others, maybe you're not from a Christian family.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Maybe there's social pressure from friends, from family that says they don't want you to come.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 So you just give in to that.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And I've also had a period in my life where I had gone through something that really knocked me off my feet.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And so coming to church was difficult because every time I came, I was crying.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I was weeping, and then people asking me questions, "How are you doing?"

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And I don't want to talk about how I'm doing because I'm going to cry.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And so I didn't really want to come.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 So my strategy, by the way, this is a strategy, but only use it if you're feeling this way,

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 because you come a little bit late to the service and you leave a little bit early to avoid all those questions.

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 But if you're feeling good, don't use that.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 If you're feeling good, don't use that as an excuse.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 We want you to be on time because God wants to work through all that we do in your life.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 So those are some of the reasons.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But how does the author of Hebrews, how does he encourage people, and how does he make his case for why do we need to gather?

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Why is it so important that we come together to worship God?

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 What's the big deal?

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 So I want to look with you first at how God, through this author of Hebrews, encourages us to gather

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 and then also look at the specific things that he encourages us to do.

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 So first, if you look at verse 19, it says, it starts with "therefore."

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And "therefore" is always an indicator that the author is referring to something that has happened before.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 So one of the typical preacher statements is, "What's the therefore there for?"

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 This was my dad joke for the day.

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 And so when you see that, well, what was happening beforehand?

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Well, actually, the author from Hebrews, he starts moving into what he wants them now to do in light of all that Jesus has done

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 through offering the sacrifice and being the high priest.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 So he wants to get into that, but he gets so excited he actually circles back and gives a summary statement.

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 So I want to look with you at this summary statement in verse 19.

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 "Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of Jesus,

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 by a new and living way, open for us through the curtain that is his body,

129
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near."

130
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 So he circles back to the sacrifice of Jesus, talks about his blood, talks about his body,

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 but he does so by referring to also things in the temple or in the tabernacle,

132
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 the most holy place or the curtain.

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Now I want to unpack this a little bit.

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 So the author of Hebrews, he highlights the sacrifice of Jesus to us,

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 and he does so by using some imagery.

136
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 So I want to show you an image from the tabernacle.

137
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I don't know if you can read this.

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 So basically the tabernacle was when Israel walked during the Exodus,

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 and then later on they had the temple, so this is a drawing of what the tabernacle layout probably was.

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And so here you see this is the holy place,

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 and then here is a division that is a curtain.

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And that curtain separated the holy of holies or the most holy place.

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And then up here, that is the Ark of the Covenant.

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 In there you have the Ten Commandments, the tablets where Moses recorded them,

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 and they're in there.

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And so our passage references this, that we have, because of the blood of Jesus,

147
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 we can go to the holy of holies.

148
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 But I want to talk a little bit about the history behind this.

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 So the priest, the high priest, actually could only go into this space one day a year.

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 And that was only the high priest.

151
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Because nobody else could just go in there.

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 If they did, they would die.

153
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Because God is holy.

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And you could not just approach God without addressing our sin and our brokenness.

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And so on the Day of Atonement, or Yom Kippur, Israel, the high priest offered some sacrifices,

156
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 and then he went into the holy of holies, that was part of the procedure.

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 They had a goat, actually had two goats, one was sacrificed, the other one,

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 the high priest laid the hand on and confessed all of Israel's sins,

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 and the goat was paraded through Jerusalem and then was driven out as a symbol of

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 that God was removing the sin from Israel to restore, to renew the relationship between God and his people.

161
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Now the good news was, this was a big deal, that God would restore the relationship with people,

162
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 that he would dwell among his people, and I should say this, this was the place where God chose to make his presence known.

163
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So it's also called the Tent of Meeting, the tabernacle.

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 But the bad news, so the good news was that the relationship was restored,

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 the bad news was that this needed to be repeated over and over and over again.

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Every year, animals had to be sacrificed, the high priest had to go in, they had to go through this procedure.

167
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Now this was a provision from God, but it pointed forward towards what Jesus would do,

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 and this is what the author of Hebrews so super unpacks.

169
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 But the big difference is with Jesus' sacrifice, with Jesus dying for our sins on the cross,

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 laying down his life for our sake, was that it is once that Jesus died for all of our sins, once and for all.

171
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Jesus died for all our sins, once and for all.

172
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And this once and for all is significant, and the author of Hebrews, he keeps emphasizing this,

173
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 and I'm just going to show you some examples, not even all.

174
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 So in Hebrews 7, 27 says, "He has no need like those high priests to offer sacrifices daily,

175
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself."

176
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Hebrews 9, verse 12, "He entered once for all into the holy place,

177
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 not by means of blood of goats and calves," which was what was offered on the Day of Atonement,

178
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 "but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption."

179
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And then Hebrews 9, verse 26 says this, "For then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world.

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."

181
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 So if you have turned to Jesus for forgiveness, he once and for all has forgiven you.

182
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And that is true. You are forgiven.

183
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And that doesn't change.

184
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 It's like your status doesn't keep changing from being forgiven and unforgiven.

185
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Jesus has forgiven for you. This is the finality of the cross.

186
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 You don't move back and forth between now you're justified and you're part of the family of God.

187
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Oh, now you're not. Now you are. Now you're not.

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 No, Jesus has dealt with your sin once and for all.

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And that is incredible because he has removed our brokenness, our sin that stood between us and him so we can have relationship with him.

190
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Now this is hard to let settle, that Jesus forgave us once and for all.

191
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 To all who, when you become a Christian, you know the two things are repentance, turning away from your old life and saying,

192
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 "Jesus, I want to follow you. I want to live your way." And then faith that we trust in Jesus.

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And this is what has happened.

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Now, I shared earlier that I struggled with receiving and accepting Jesus' forgiveness.

195
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 I struggled with living in this forgiveness and love.

196
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 You know what that actually really means is that I said to myself that Jesus' forgiveness depends on me and on what I do.

197
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 It actually depends on my performance, on how good I act or how many times I confess and all of that.

198
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 But that's not true.

199
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 So instead of accepting and receiving what Jesus has done, I put myself into this role of like,

200
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 "I need to work harder to be more perfect so that I'm acceptable, so that I'm forgiven."

201
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 But Jesus already had forgiven me.

202
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Now, of course, we still need to clear up things when we do sin against God.

203
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And as Jesus followers, as Christians, we still do that.

204
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 We still come and we confess.

205
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And there is something in that where he removes or restores a relationship in a new way, removes barriers and things.

206
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 But we are forgiven once and for all.

207
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And the only way we realize that is actually when God makes that known to us, when he reveals that to us.

208
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And when we can just receive this love and forgiveness and where he can free us to experience this removal of our sin,

209
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 this removal of shame, and where we can just live in that freedom.

210
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And so we cannot conjure that up out of our own strength, but this is something that God wants to do.

211
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 He has forgiven you. He loves you.

212
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 It's not based on your performance, it's based on what he did.

213
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And so the author of Hebrews, he's hammering this point home over and over again, once and for all, once and for all, once and for all.

214
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And he is encouraging the Jewish Christian community to keep meeting.

215
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Now there's another part to it.

216
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Because when Jesus, as it describes, and can we go to the next slide please?

217
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Okay.

218
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I want to take a step back a little bit.

219
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 So Jesus talks about, or in Hebrews it talks about that Jesus, because of his blood, we can now confidently enter the most holy place.

220
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 You know that means because of what he has done, we can confidently come into his presence.

221
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 There's nothing that separates us anymore from his presence.

222
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Just remember, the high priest could only go into God's presence once a year after going through all these rituals.

223
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 But because of what Jesus has done, we can come into his presence.

224
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 We have access.

225
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Another part was that it talks about Jesus' body sort of making a way through the curtain.

226
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Actually when Jesus died in Matthew 27, 53-51, when he died on the cross, it's recorded,

227
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 "And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielding up his spirit, and behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom."

228
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 So when Jesus died on the cross, he opened up the way for us so that we can be in God's presence.

229
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 That we can know his presence.

230
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Again, we can have communion with God.

231
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And we can have relationship with God.

232
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 That we can experience the love of God.

233
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 This is incredible.

234
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And this would have been mind-blowing for Jewish people.

235
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Because they came out of the first covenant, the old covenant.

236
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Where they had to go through all these rituals.

237
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Now, because of Jesus' come, suddenly this way has been paved open to know God in a different way.

238
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 And have a different type of access, a different type of relationship, a different type of forgiveness.

239
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Wow, that's amazing.

240
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Then he also talks about in verse 21, that Jesus is the high priest over the house of God.

241
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And so he's the high priest of the temple.

242
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And when we enter, he is there.

243
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 We belong, we're entering the space because of the work that he has done.

244
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 And he welcomes us.

245
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And we can come confidently into the presence of God.

246
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 So, in light of all this incredible thing that the author of Hebrews has been unpacking,

247
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 he says then in verse 22, "Let us draw near to God."

248
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Let us come.

249
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Let us come into God's presence.

250
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Let us worship God.

251
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And he's talking about the people of God.

252
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Now, of course, this can mean us individually, but it also means us together.

253
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Let us draw near to God.

254
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Let us come into his presence.

255
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Let us hear from God.

256
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Let us experience God.

257
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And then he gives three instructions.

258
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 You see, three times he starts with "let us."

259
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Let us draw near to God.

260
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Let us hold on to our hope.

261
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And then let us spur one another on towards love and good deeds.

262
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 So I'm going to pack these things.

263
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 The first one is, "Let us draw near to God."

264
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Now, again, we come because we have been granted access.

265
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 And I was thinking of like the coolest time in my life that I've gotten access to something where other people couldn't go.

266
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And so one of the things I came up with was when I was a resident chaplain at Baylor University, I worked with RA, so residents' assistants.

267
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And one of them was the president from Alpha Phi Alpha, a fraternity, and the other one was a treasurer of that fraternity.

268
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 So it's an African-American fraternity.

269
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And so they invited me to their big party.

270
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 So I didn't think much of it.

271
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 I come to the party, and there's a line of 100 people standing outside not getting in.

272
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And I was able to just walk up and just step right in.

273
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I had access because I knew them.

274
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And I felt really cool for five minutes.

275
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 But just think, like you -- we have access to God.

276
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 You know, that is so much cooler, so much more amazing, so much more incredible than anyone else here on earth that we can have access to.

277
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And I think that's hard for us to fathom how special and how amazing that is, but it's incredible.

278
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 You know, we have access to draw near.

279
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 But what this also implies, let us draw near, is that we don't always do it.

280
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 That there's a choice involved, whether we come into God's presence, whether we commune with God or whether we don't.

281
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And the author of Hebrews is saying, "Guys, we need to get together.

282
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 You know, Jesus has given us access.

283
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Why would we not come into his presence as his people?

284
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Why would we not go?

285
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 He has opened the way."

286
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Notice two ways that we enter his presence.

287
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 One is on our own.

288
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 You know, when we pray, we enter into his presence.

289
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 When we read God's word, we enter into his presence.

290
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 When we worship, we enter into his presence.

291
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 There's also a spiritual practice called practicing the presence of God.

292
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 What does that mean?

293
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 That sounds pretty cool, right?

294
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Well, actually, it's us becoming aware of God, because God is always present.

295
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 But it's us who are not present.

296
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And it's us learning to live our daily life in just dialogue, in prayer with God, as we go through the day.

297
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And so that's a personal thing.

298
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 But then corporately, and this is really what the text is encouraging us, is that we come together in his presence as the people of God.

299
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 And there's a verse in 1 Corinthians 3.16, and it says this.

300
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And basically, so let me read it.

301
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 "Don't you know that you yourself are God's temple, and that God's Spirit lives among you?"

302
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 So this is not just talking about us individually.

303
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 So individually, yes, we have received the Holy Spirit.

304
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 The Holy Spirit lives in us.

305
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 But this is actually talking to a group of people.

306
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 So the Holy Spirit is present differently when we gather together than just when we are alone.

307
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 The Holy Spirit is present.

308
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 He is present here right now among us.

309
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 He lives among us, the people of God.

310
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And he wants to reveal himself to you.

311
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 He wants to reveal his power.

312
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 He wants to encourage you.

313
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 He wants to make himself known.

314
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 He wants to minister to you, build you up.

315
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 It's absolutely incredible.

316
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 And as I was thinking about this, so I have a phrase here.

317
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 When we come to worship God together, we come expectantly because the Spirit of God lives among us.

318
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 So when we come here every Sunday, you can come expectantly because the Holy Spirit is present differently here because we come together as the body of Christ.

319
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Now, what's also interesting is Jesus did not just die to forgive us our sins, but he also died to bring us into the family of God.

320
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 So part of his purpose for us is that we gather as his family, that we gather as his church, because he wants to build us up.

321
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 He wants to encourage us.

322
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And he has a mission for us as a church, but we can only fulfill that when we are together.

323
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 So God does certain things only when we are together.

324
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 When we meet him, when we gather together in worship, when we praise him.

325
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Now, when I was thinking about this, was like a lot of my significant moments in my life where God met me was when I was together worshipping with others.

326
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 When I came to Hong Kong, I told a story another time, there was a lot of brokenness and pain and sorrow and even really I had a traumatic experience.

327
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 So I came only functioning at 67%.

328
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 I wasn't my full self.

329
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 But when I came together in worship, Holy Spirit, every Sunday was doing some healing work in my heart.

330
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And there was tears streaming down my face, because the presence of God was doing something.

331
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 So one time, somebody had a prophetic word for me.

332
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Wow, again, this was part of a healing journey.

333
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 So when we come together, there's things that God wants to do in your life.

334
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 He wants to bring healing, he wants to remove shame, he wants to build you up, strengthen you, encourage you through his presence.

335
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Earlier, I can't share the details, but somebody was just ministered in the Cantonese service just powerfully to.

336
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And what happened when we gathered for worship, that there was encouragement.

337
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And we were sitting there, Francesca was here too, weeping because of the work that the Holy Spirit was doing.

338
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 So when we worship together, God wants to strengthen his people.

339
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And this is something, there is no lone ranger Christianity.

340
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 You cannot be a Christian just on your own.

341
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 We are meant to be together, we need to build each other up, and this is where we get into the next part.

342
00:27:42,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 It talks about, "Let us hold unswervingly to the hope that we profess for he who promises is faithful."

343
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Now, it's hard to hold on to our hope on our own.

344
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 But when we come together, we're encouraged, we're strengthened to hold on to Jesus who is our hope.

345
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 So we're holding on to a person.

346
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 We profess Jesus, and he is faithful.

347
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 But we hear about his faithfulness when we sing, when we hear God's word preached, when we pray for each other.

348
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And so coming together is like you come with a tank empty, and God wants to fill your tank.

349
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 He wants to fill you up, he wants to renew your hope, he wants to strengthen you.

350
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 So God builds us up this way.

351
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 But then we're also told, "Spur one another on towards love and good deeds."

352
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Not giving up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another,

353
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 and all the more as you see the day approaching.

354
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Now it's interesting. It starts with "consider."

355
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 So we actually need to proactively think about how we can encourage one another.

356
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And then the word for spurring is paroxymous.

357
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 I didn't say that good. The Greek word.

358
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And it means to incite, to stir up, to provoke.

359
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 We're meant to really stir each other up towards love and good deeds.

360
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And I was thinking about how that has happened in my life.

361
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And one of the things I thought of was that one person, one time he pointed out to me that somebody was on their own.

362
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 That nobody was really talking to him, and I hadn't noticed.

363
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 And so I decided to befriend him.

364
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 So my friend was spurring me on towards love and good deeds,

365
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 and I ended up connecting him to other people so we could find this place.

366
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So that's another thing God wants to do. He wants us to spur on one another towards love and good deeds.

367
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And he also wants us to encourage one another.

368
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And you notice the word "one another." So this only happens when we're together.

369
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 This doesn't happen when we're alone.

370
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 When we come and worship together before God, that's when this happens.

371
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Where we have this opportunity to do this.

372
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 And so I want to invite the worship team to come up.

373
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 I want to ask a question.

374
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Who can I encourage today or this week by my presence, my actions, and my words?

375
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Who can I encourage in this way?

376
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And I actually really want you to think about this.

377
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Who can you encourage? Who's God asking you to encourage?

378
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 But as I was sharing earlier as well, that our worship, even us gathering together,

379
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 always flows out of us beholding who Jesus is.

380
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Out of beholding his beauty. Out of beholding the sacrifice that he has made for us

381
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 so that he died for us once and for all.

382
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 And a lot of times we lose sight of that.

383
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 And when we worship together, we refocus on that.

384
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 We are renewed. We are strengthened.

385
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 We receive grace, receive mercy when we come together.

386
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 So I want to invite everyone to stand.

387
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And I would just love to pray over us.

388
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Jesus, you know every one of us here.

389
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 You know those of us who struggle to receive your forgiveness, your grace,

390
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 where that's just been hanging over us.

391
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 But you have forgiven us once and for all.

392
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Your feelings towards us do not change.

393
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 You love us. You have given yourself for us.

394
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And Holy Spirit, will you just bring this home to those of us who struggle

395
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 to receive your forgiveness, to receive your love.

396
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 That we can let go of these attempts to try to earn

397
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 right standing before you through your perfection.

398
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 That's not what you're asking for perfection.

399
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 You're just asking that we come and say, "Jesus, I need you.

400
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 I need your mercy. I need your grace. I need your forgiveness."

401
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 So Holy Spirit, will you pour out your forgiveness right now

402
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 as we come to you and say, "We need you. We need your forgiveness."

403
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 And will you make it known that you have forgiven us once and for all.

404
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 And will you free up your people to freely come to worship.

405
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 To come to worship you joyfully.

406
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Not having this dark cloud hanging over us.

407
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And Lord, even as we're going to worship here in just a moment,

408
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 will you build up your people?

409
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Will you strengthen your people?

410
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Will you encourage your people?

411
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Will you do something beautiful as we draw into your presence?

412
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 As we offer ourselves to you, will you meet us?

413
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Will you mend the broken hearts in here?

414
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Will you renew hope where hope has been lost?

415
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 So we come now and we worship you.

416
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 And we thank you, Jesus, that you are the one who loves us

417
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 and has forgiven us. We pray all this in your name, Jesus. Amen.
