1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,500
 In the summer of 2002, I was driving south on Highway 1 from Monterey, California.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,260
 And I pulled up on the side of the road, I started hiking up this trail, this familiar

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,120
 trail in the coastal mountains.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,480
 Now if you're not familiar with California, and particularly that stretch of California,

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,400
 it is some of the most beautiful central coastline there is.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,080
 I mean it is absolutely beautiful.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:40,400
 There is redwood trees, there is wildlife, there is the Pacific Ocean, and you have incredible

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,080
 views.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,800
 And so I wanted to go and hike to this bench that had an amazing view.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,800
 And I wanted to spend some time there with God, to pray, to hear from him, to seek him.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,840
 And so as I finally made my way up to this bench, which was quite a hike, I sat down

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,760
 on it and I noticed that there was a plaque on the bench.

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,760
 Now one of those planks that usually mentions who donated to the bench.

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:20,120
 So as I was reading the plaque, it said, "There has been a change of plants."

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:27,640
 And I just had to smile, because that summed up my life in the last year.

16
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:36,040
 God had spoken to me, and unexpectedly there was a change of plants that had turned things

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,920
 upside down for me.

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:47,760
 Now we, as Christians, we all in one way or another experience God speaking to us, giving

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,120
 us words, giving us new direction.

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,000
 And that can look different ways for different people.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,320
 I know for some of you that has meant joining this church plant, where there was a word

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,360
 at the beginning when we announced we're going to plant a church in Yuen Long, and some of

23
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,560
 you felt a stirring, this word from God to be part of this community and be part of the

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,600
 work that God wanted to do here.

25
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,920
 And so God spoke to you in that way, and I believe for many of you it was unexpected,

26
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,640
 because you didn't know we were going to do that.

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,600
 Then that might be in your workplace, that God maybe calls you into a different workplace,

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,600
 or he calls you into doing something differently in your workplace than you have done it before.

29
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,080
 And so what I want to do in this message, I want to explore with you today a question.

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:52,400
 The question is, how can we say yes to God's work in our lives and be open to his leading?

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,360
 How do we do that?

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,320
 How do we say yes and surrender ourselves to what God is saying to us and then walk

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
 in it?

34
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,160
 Easier said than done, right?

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,200
 Yes.

36
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,880
 So we're continuing in our Advent Sermon series, "Surprising Joy."

37
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,960
 Now you might wonder, what does a change of plans have to do with joy?

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,080
 Those two might not go together in your mind.

39
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,000
 So I want to say a little bit about that.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,520
 A lot of times when God does have a word for us, speaks to us about something, initially

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
 it's not easy.

42
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,360
 Actually, a lot of times we complain when God gives us a new word.

43
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,080
 And we're like, "Oh no, I don't think this is God.

44
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,520
 I think this is from somebody else.

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,200
 I don't want this."

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,600
 And then we wrestle with it.

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,160
 And it's only a lot of times later when we actually walk in obedience to that word that

48
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,240
 there is a surprising joy that comes.

49
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,840
 So that's where we're going to head today.

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,400
 And so I just felt like I should say this up front because a lot of times you don't

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,840
 associate change with surprising joy.

52
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,640
 So today we're going to pick up where Pastor John left off last week.

53
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,800
 We looked last week at the story of Zachariah and Elizabeth and how God met them.

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,440
 They'd been praying for a child and God met Zachariah in the temple and he promised them

55
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,080
 that Elizabeth would be with child, that he would prepare the way of the Lord.

56
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,200
 And then at the end of the passage that we looked at last week, this incredible miracle

57
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,360
 happened because Elizabeth was barren, so she hadn't been able to conceive.

58
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,920
 And now in old age, she was found to be pregnant.

59
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,480
 And so we talked about these desert and barren seasons in which God meets us.

60
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,240
 And where he can surprise us with joy, even on the ones where we've given up on, where

61
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,760
 we stop believing that God can meet us in those places.

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,880
 So today we're going to pick up literally at the verse where we left off last time.

63
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,980
 So we are in Luke chapter 1 verse 26.

64
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,240
 So let me read it to you.

65
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,480
 In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a

66
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,040
 town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant

67
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,080
 of David.

68
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,000
 The virgin's name was Mary.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,760
 The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored.

70
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
 The Lord is with you."

71
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,800
 Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might

72
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,440
 be.

73
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:51,720
 So in the previous passage, the angel met Zechariah in the temple as he was doing his

74
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,960
 priestly service.

75
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,120
 And so now we hear that the angel's meeting Mary in Galilee in a town of Nazareth.

76
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,000
 One took place in a place of prominence and of importance that people would perceive in

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 a temple.

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,480
 It's the center of the worship of Israel.

79
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,320
 The other one literally took place in the middle of nowhere.

80
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:22,400
 And as a matter of fact, Nazareth was so insignificant that it's not even mentioned in the Old Testament.

81
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:30,840
 When Philip was introducing Nathanael in the Gospel of John to Jesus of Nazareth, Nathanael

82
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,780
 responded, "Nazareth?

83
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,880
 Can anything good come from there?"

84
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,360
 So on top of not being significant, it didn't even have a good reputation.

85
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,540
 So we see that it's quite an extreme contrast of where the angel meets Zechariah and where

86
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,040
 he meets Mary.

87
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,880
 So perhaps it's actually important for us today to be reminded that God doesn't just

88
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,800
 show up in the moments like just at church, even though he does do that too.

89
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,480
 But he shows up in our everyday moments, even in mundane ones where we think he isn't there.

90
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,480
 Because for God, every place, every moment is sacred and he is everywhere.

91
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:25,280
 And he often meets us in unexpected places during unexpected times.

92
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,960
 I sense we need to hear that because sometimes we feel like we need to go to a certain place

93
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,560
 to hear from God, but God can speak to you where you are.

94
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,480
 He can speak to you in the season that you are in in your life.

95
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,800
 So I guess the question is, are you ready to hear?

96
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,840
 Well next we were introduced to Mary and we're told that she is pledged to be married to

97
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
 Joseph.

98
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,880
 Now, Luke doesn't explain what "pledged" means.

99
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,400
 Another word for this would be "she's betrothed."

100
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,600
 So what that meant in a cultural context is that Mary's father has agreed that Joseph

101
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,680
 is allowed to marry Mary and Joseph has paid her a bridal price.

102
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,200
 And Mary has as of yet not moved in with Joseph, so that's the pledging period, the period

103
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
 in between.

104
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,080
 So that's what's going on there.

105
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,360
 And so the angel tells Mary in verse 28, "Greetings you who are highly favored.

106
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,840
 The Lord is with you."

107
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:40,880
 But then we're told that Mary is troubled, not at his presence, but she's actually troubled

108
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,760
 at his words.

109
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,120
 Interesting, right?

110
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,500
 I think if an angel shows up I would freak out because there's an angel there.

111
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,720
 Maybe he could handle the words more.

112
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,880
 But she is freaked out or troubled by his words, by what he says.

113
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,800
 So let's think about that a little bit more.

114
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
 Why is Mary troubled?

115
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,000
 What's so troubling about what the angel says?

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,880
 Now imagine you have an ambassador of the president of some important country.

117
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,480
 You can choose your country.

118
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
 Everyone have a country?

119
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
 Yes?

120
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,600
 Okay, good.

121
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,320
 So that person comes to you in your home, comes to you in your workplace, and they say,

122
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,200
 "Greetings, Derek, you who are highly favored."

123
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,080
 And you're like, "Okay, hi."

124
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,760
 And if I would be greeted this way, "Greetings, Tim, you who are highly favored."

125
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,880
 I'm like, "Did the angel or did the ambassador, is he getting the right Tim?

126
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,080
 Is he not looking for somebody else?"

127
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,560
 Because I'm not at the center of power.

128
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,120
 I don't think that any ambassador or any president has any message for me.

129
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:57,760
 And so why in the world would that guy or that woman show up and give me this strange

130
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,040
 message?

131
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,560
 Because I don't perceive myself as somebody who would get this type of message.

132
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,680
 And I think that's how Mary must have felt, that she didn't feel like she was the type

133
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,520
 of person who would get this type of message from God.

134
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:22,480
 You know, "You who are highly favored, the Lord is with you."

135
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,360
 Because she didn't perceive herself in that way, that she would be the type of person

136
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,620
 who would receive this type of message.

137
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,400
 She was a teenage girl, probably 12, 13 years old.

138
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,840
 At that time, women got engaged and married.

139
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,200
 She was young.

140
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,840
 She was in an insignificant town.

141
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,280
 She was seen by her contemporary society as insignificant.

142
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:53,760
 And yet here, this messenger from God shows up in her house and delivers her this message.

143
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,960
 So this is a lot to process.

144
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:06,120
 Are you sure you have the right person?

145
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,320
 But when God, through His Word and His Spirit, sort of breaks into our mundane, our everyday

146
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,240
 life, I think a lot of us can relate to how Mary feels.

147
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,400
 Like, "Are you sure you have the right person?

148
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,520
 Are you sure you're asking the right person to do this, whatever He's asking you to do?"

149
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,320
 Because a lot of times, we don't think that we're the right person.

150
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,920
 We don't feel like we're qualified.

151
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,220
 We don't think we have what it takes or whatever God brings our way.

152
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,640
 We think this message must be for somebody else.

153
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,080
 And so there is just a lot to process.

154
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:55,240
 So how would you feel when God has a word for you and meets you and speaks to you?

155
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,720
 So let's continue in our passage.

156
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,620
 In verse 30, it says this, "But the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary.

157
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,840
 You have found favor with God.

158
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:13,180
 You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.

159
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,360
 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.

160
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,800
 The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob's

161
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,560
 descendants forever.

162
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,240
 His kingdom will never end.'"

163
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
 How will this be?

164
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,040
 Mary asked the angel, "Since I'm a virgin."

165
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,960
 So the angel's message reassures Mary, "Do not be afraid."

166
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,800
 So there was some fear in this encounter.

167
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:51,000
 The words stirred fear in her, and he reassures her, "Don't be afraid.

168
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,960
 You have found favor with God."

169
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,200
 Now this is the second time that the angel mentions favor.

170
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
 First she was highly favored.

171
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,480
 Now he says, "You are favored."

172
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,600
 What does that mean, to be favored by God?

173
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,640
 Does it mean you're God's favorite, like the only favorite?

174
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:18,240
 Having God's favor means that God is showing you grace, that he's showing you his goodness,

175
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
 his mercy.

176
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,960
 A lot of times when we think of grace, we think of forgiveness, and that is one of the

177
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,320
 most amazing graces, like the song says, that we can receive in our lives, that we know

178
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,120
 the grace of Jesus, his forgiveness.

179
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,600
 But God's grace is much bigger than that.

180
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,280
 His favor is much bigger than that.

181
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:44,280
 Now here in Mary's instance, the favor is also that God is involving her in her work,

182
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,080
 in his work.

183
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:53,640
 That God is inviting her into being part of this beautiful thing that God is doing.

184
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,120
 That's also God's favor, that he invites us into the things that he is doing.

185
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,640
 He does it with every Christian in different ways.

186
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,360
 There's also God's favor, God's grace in that.

187
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,760
 But it also means that he will provide what is needed.

188
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,240
 He promises Mary his presence.

189
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
 He's going to be with her.

190
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,200
 The Lord is with you.

191
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,840
 He's not going to be alone in what he's asking her to do.

192
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,440
 He's going to provide for her what she needs to carry out what he's asking her to carry

193
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
 out.

194
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,320
 So that's also the favor and the grace of God.

195
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,600
 And of course, the biggest favor that we experience is that we become part of the family of God,

196
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,960
 you know, that we are children of God.

197
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,720
 And God's grace we can never earn.

198
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,920
 We don't deserve it.

199
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,240
 But it's just something that he loves to give when we come to him and when we receive this

200
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
 gift.

201
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,600
 And it's the same with these things that he brings to us.

202
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,920
 It's a gift of grace.

203
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,480
 We can reject it or we can receive it and just trust that he is with us and that he

204
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:08,280
 will give us what we need to do whatever he's inviting us into.

205
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,440
 Now Mary finds out some of the details of what it means to be highly favored.

206
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,680
 Probably not what we would associate with being highly favored.

207
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,480
 Or maybe in some ways yes, in some ways no.

208
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,440
 She is told that she will bear a son.

209
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,920
 And through what the angel Gabriel says, it's also very clear that this will be the Messiah.

210
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:37,400
 He's actually quoting verses from 2 Samuel 7 where there's a promise to King David that

211
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:43,360
 he will have a descendant who will reign on his throne forever.

212
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,200
 And so Mary knew this.

213
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:53,320
 And so she's understanding, wow, process that information, right?

214
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,440
 Who can process that?

215
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,040
 So she learns a little bit about the identity of the child that she will have.

216
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,400
 And suddenly also the name Jesus, Yeshua, takes on a different significance.

217
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,800
 It was a common name during Jesus' time actually, the name Jesus.

218
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,280
 But it means God saves, God heals.

219
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,440
 That's literally what Jesus was going to do.

220
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:30,280
 He had come to save the world from their sins and to restore them back to the Father.

221
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,320
 Restore us back to the Father.

222
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,520
 Wow, what an incredible word for Mary.

223
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,000
 Now there's two shocking things in here, right?

224
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,600
 Actually it's probably more than that, but I'm just going to talk about two.

225
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:51,400
 The first one is that she is going to give birth to the expected, the longed for Messiah,

226
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,720
 the one that Israel's been waiting for, the rescuer, the redeemer.

227
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,200
 Wow, that's a message.

228
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,760
 And secondly, probably very personally shocking to her is that she's going to have a child,

229
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,200
 but she is a virgin.

230
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,800
 She has had no sexual relationships with a man.

231
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,920
 Wow.

232
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,960
 Now there's precedent in the Bible for God blessing families with children, you know,

233
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,560
 deep down the line when they thought they couldn't conceive and God does a miracle,

234
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,880
 like we saw with Zachariah and Elizabeth, that she was barren, but he did a miracle

235
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,800
 and gave them a child.

236
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,840
 But there is no precedent for what's going to happen with Mary, where somebody who is

237
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:45,160
 not yet married, who is pledged but not yet married, and who is a virgin and is told that

238
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,800
 she will have a child.

239
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,920
 So Mary has some questions.

240
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,320
 I think we can all understand that, right?

241
00:17:52,320 --> 00:18:01,000
 If that was coming to all the women in here your way, you would have some questions.

242
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,960
 Like how, Lord, what, how does this work?

243
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:16,960
 And so what I love is that Mary actually brings her question to God by asking the angel, who's

244
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,500
 the representative for God in this case.

245
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,280
 How will this be since I am a virgin?

246
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
 Now I want us to notice that.

247
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,480
 You know, she could have just said, no thanks, moved on, but she chooses to actually to engage

248
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,760
 with a question, just wanting to understand, Lord, I want to understand how is this possible?

249
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
 How will this be?

250
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,080
 Can you help me?

251
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,920
 I need to understand this.

252
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
 You're asking me to do this.

253
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
 Can you help me understand this?

254
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,600
 That's actually an act of faith.

255
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:55,600
 Now there's maybe some questions, some doubts in there, but she's trying to understand.

256
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:03,760
 And that faith of trying to understand that honors God.

257
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,920
 So let's see how, actually what the response is.

258
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,680
 So in verse 35, let's go there.

259
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,360
 It says this, the angel answered, the Holy Spirit will come on you and the power of the

260
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,600
 most high will overshadow you.

261
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,120
 So the Holy you want to be born will be called the son of God.

262
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,560
 Even Elizabeth, your relative's going to have a child in her old age.

263
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,720
 And she who was said to be unable to conceive is in the sixth month.

264
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,000
 For no word from God will ever fail.

265
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:45,160
 Now what I love is that Mary asked a question, God actually gives her an answer.

266
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,560
 He actually does respond to her question.

267
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,400
 Now God invites us always to ask him questions, whether we think they're big or small, we

268
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,720
 can bring any question to him.

269
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,840
 When he asks us to do something, when there's a word that breaks in, or even for anything

270
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,000
 in your life, God welcomes questions, he invites them.

271
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,720
 Now we don't always get an answer immediately.

272
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,440
 Like in this case, Mary gets an answer immediately.

273
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,600
 A lot of times it comes later, a lot of times it's not the answer that we expect.

274
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,760
 But she does get an answer.

275
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,360
 And the answer is that the Holy Spirit will come upon her, right?

276
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,400
 And he will, it's the same Spirit of God who is part of God's creation who will create

277
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,300
 this child within her and will do this miracle within her.

278
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:38,160
 So that's the answer that she gets.

279
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:44,560
 And the angel then shares a powerful truth with Mary.

280
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,300
 And I think she really needed to hear this word to be able to cope with all that she's

281
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,760
 being told.

282
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,580
 And it's in verse 37, I have two translations.

283
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,800
 One says, "For no word from God will ever fail."

284
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,520
 You know, what I'm saying is going to come to pass.

285
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,880
 The word never fails, it never returns void.

286
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,520
 Another way to translate it is, "For nothing will be impossible with God."

287
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,520
 You know, nothing is impossible with God.

288
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,720
 Now what Mary heard seemed impossible, but God is ensuring her nothing is impossible

289
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
 with God.

290
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,600
 And if God calls you to something, if he asks you to do something, you know, it is possible.

291
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,360
 And we lose sight of, we get caught up with the impossible and we focus on that.

292
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,140
 And we get fearful and we get stuck on that.

293
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:43,280
 But I believe that the angel is giving this word to Mary because she needs to be reminded

294
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,040
 of who God is, who is making this ask.

295
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:52,000
 It's not just anyone, it's not, you know, somebody, a relative asking her, you know,

296
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 this question.

297
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,120
 It's God.

298
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,800
 The creator of the universe.

299
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:04,000
 The almighty with all power, who has no limitations.

300
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,840
 He can create things out of nothing.

301
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,240
 And so she needs to remember who God is.

302
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:23,720
 Now this is the biggest news that I think I can imagine dropping into somebody's lap.

303
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
 Right?

304
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:33,720
 What message she received for a teenage girl in the middle of nowhere.

305
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:41,920
 And Mary, she must have been aware of all the shame and all the talking of people that

306
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,280
 would be involved in that.

307
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,520
 Now here she is pregnant.

308
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,180
 You can't hide your pregnancy.

309
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,240
 And people can see it.

310
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,440
 In that cultural context, there was a huge stigma on that.

311
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,920
 Actually it was even theoretically punishable by death.

312
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,800
 Now at that time, that was not usually exercised.

313
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,600
 But it was a very serious matter.

314
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,000
 And who would believe her if she explains, well, God told me that the Holy Spirit, you

315
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,400
 know, will create his child within me.

316
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,480
 Now who's going to believe that?

317
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,280
 As a matter of fact, Joseph didn't believe her, the man that she was engaged with.

318
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,640
 He didn't believe her.

319
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,680
 When he found out that she was pregnant, he wanted to quietly divorce her.

320
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,660
 It was only when the angel appeared to Joseph that he believed Mary.

321
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,120
 So this is a very costly ask.

322
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,840
 I mean, it's not an easy thing that God is inviting Mary into.

323
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,400
 And of course, it's also incredible, and I don't want to lose sight of that as well,

324
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,080
 like that she gets to give birth to the savior of this world.

325
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,480
 She gets to give birth to the Messiah they long for, you know, rescue and redeem and

326
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,520
 king.

327
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,080
 But it's both of these things.

328
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,640
 And a lot of times when we hear this Christmas narrative over and over again, for those of

329
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:10,080
 you who've been in church for quite a while, it's easy to forget the shocking nature, you

330
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,760
 know, of this ask, right?

331
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,520
 I mean, it's not an easy ask.

332
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,440
 So how does Mary respond to this?

333
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,480
 Well, we can read about that in verse 38.

334
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,600
 She says, "I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered.

335
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,660
 "May your word to me be fulfilled."

336
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,720
 Then the angel left her.

337
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,920
 I am the Lord's servant.

338
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,000
 May your word to me be fulfilled.

339
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,280
 Wow.

340
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:46,000
 What faith and courage from this teenage girl.

341
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,280
 Make herself available, God, to surrender to him, to trust him that he will provide

342
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:59,200
 what is needed in this very difficult circumstance that she will have to be walking through.

343
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,700
 But she has faith, and God has assured her, and she believes this assurance.

344
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,600
 She believes that nothing is impossible with God.

345
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,300
 She believes that the Lord is with her.

346
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,560
 And so she takes the step of faith and surrenders and makes herself available.

347
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:19,880
 I mean, it's just incredible.

348
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,600
 Now what about us?

349
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,940
 What if God brings us a word, asks us to do something?

350
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,600
 What if there is a change of plans that he has for you?

351
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,280
 Which brings us back to the opening question.

352
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,320
 How can we say yes to God's work in our lives and be open to his leading?

353
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,160
 How can we be like Mary and just say, "I am the Lord's servant.

354
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,480
 May your word to me be fulfilled."

355
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:55,680
 Now earlier I started off with a story of going to a bench and sitting on this bench

356
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,040
 that said, "There has been a change of plans."

357
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,640
 What had happened?

358
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,800
 Well I was in my early 20s, I was working as a financial advisor for Morgan Stanley

359
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,120
 in Monterey, California.

360
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,000
 And I was attending Santa Cruz Bible Church.

361
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,880
 Santa Cruz where all the surfing and all that happens, also an exciting place.

362
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,560
 And in that church they had a tradition where every year they had a missions month, where

363
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,600
 they had missionaries, mission partners that they supported that came, they preached, they

364
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,720
 cared about the work that they did.

365
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,640
 And the first Sunday I'm listening to, I can't remember who it was, who was preaching, and

366
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,040
 I'm just wrecked.

367
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,360
 I have tears in my eyes, which I think might have been the first time I had tears in my

368
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,840
 eyes in church in my life.

369
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,200
 And I'm like trying to figure out what's happening to me.

370
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
 Like what's going on?

371
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
 What does this mean?

372
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,120
 So I talked to a friend and he's like, "Well I think God might be asking you to do something

373
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
 or so."

374
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
 I said, "Oh, interesting."

375
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,800
 So I prayed over there, I talked to some friends about this.

376
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
 Next Sunday, same thing.

377
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
 Tears.

378
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,520
 I was like, "Oh, God, what does this mean?"

379
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,000
 Third Sunday, even worse.

380
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,240
 It's like snot, you know, like we're talking like the full weeping and things.

381
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,400
 And I'm just like, "What in the world?"

382
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,960
 But on that third Sunday, I was very clear that God was calling me to serve him.

383
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,080
 I didn't understand how.

384
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,320
 I wasn't really on that trajectory.

385
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,280
 But I also had the strong sense that I actually needed to quit my job.

386
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,160
 That's kind of a scary move.

387
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,680
 So that day, I don't remember when, I think it was right after the service, it's a long

388
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:54,160
 time ago, I drove to the office, cleared out my office.

389
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:00,600
 The next day, I came in not with a suit, but in my casual clothes, I walked to my boss

390
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:10,200
 and I told him that God was asking me to do something and that I needed to quit my job.

391
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
 And my boss actually commended me for my courage.

392
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,320
 He's like, "Wow, that's a courageous thing to do."

393
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,080
 But he also told me, "Don't show up at another investment firm because we invested a lot

394
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
 of money in you.

395
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,640
 And if you show up somewhere else, we need to charge you for that."

396
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,800
 I was like, "Okay, I'm very sorry.

397
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 I'm sorry, sorry."

398
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,400
 Okay, so now I quit my job.

399
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,600
 I don't have a job, but I don't know what I'm doing.

400
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,520
 And actually, one important part of the story is, which I didn't realize at that time, and

401
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:50,680
 I think that that's not normal, like right away quitting your job, so just saying that.

402
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:56,280
 But what I realized was that I was about to invest a lot of money for somebody I knew.

403
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,000
 Actually, I was already in process in the making.

404
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,680
 And if that would have gone through, I could have not backed out.

405
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,440
 I would have been stuck in my workplace.

406
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,520
 And so I actually even went back to the office, told the cashier, "Hey, when this check comes

407
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,120
 in, can you let me know so I can get it, send it back to the people?"

408
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,520
 So this was also part of God's time.

409
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:23,160
 He pulled me out this last second before I was so committed that there was no way out.

410
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,920
 And there really would have been no immediate way out.

411
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,000
 So I didn't tell my parents about this, because I knew what they would say, so then I did

412
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,720
 call them, and they were freaked out.

413
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,760
 "You are making the biggest mistake of your life.

414
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,400
 You know this is the second job you're quitting within not too long a period of time.

415
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,640
 People are going to think you're flaky.

416
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,480
 Nobody will ever want to hire you again."

417
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,760
 Thank you, mom and dad, for the encouragement.

418
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,280
 But honestly, just true feelings from a parent, right?

419
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,200
 Being worried about their son who's just starting his career life.

420
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,160
 And so I started freaking out.

421
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,840
 Did I hear God wrong?

422
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,480
 Did I make a big mistake?

423
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,440
 And so I needed to bring those fears and questions to God.

424
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,480
 So I prayed, "God, can you just help me understand this?"

425
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,440
 I also prayed that my parents would actually see that God had called me and was asking

426
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,300
 me to do something differently, that there was a change of plans.

427
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,720
 So then I ended up getting a different job in the meantime, because I needed to pay my

428
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,280
 bills.

429
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,680
 And I applied for one of the organizations that I heard share on one of the Mission Sundays.

430
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,400
 So I ended up going with an organization called Mercy Ships, a medical mission ship bringing

431
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,080
 hope and healing, most of the time along the West Coast of Africa.

432
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,680
 So I joined them in Sierra Leone and in Senegal.

433
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,640
 I did a discipleship training school there.

434
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,760
 Shout out to my YWAM friends here, where I served in the finance department half the

435
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,000
 time, attended that school, and then we had an outreach.

436
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,760
 So I did that.

437
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,480
 And during that time, God answered a lot of questions I had as well, because I was like,

438
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,600
 "Do I even have what it takes to serve God in this way?"

439
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,960
 Because I really didn't perceive or see myself in this way.

440
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,520
 That was not, like I said, my trajectory beforehand.

441
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,480
 All my friends were surprised at this.

442
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:34,080
 And so then I finished that time, and I'm going to wrap up the story in a second.

443
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,920
 And I felt like if God is asking me to do this, I probably need to study, go to seminary,

444
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,900
 get some education.

445
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,240
 But I had borrowed a lot of money from my parents to do this mercy trip thing, because

446
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,520
 I didn't have much time to raise funds, so I owed them quite a bit of money.

447
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,160
 And they were like, "Yeah, you're going to pay that back."

448
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,740
 So I was like, "God, can you provide for me?"

449
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:02,100
 So I only applied to one seminary, and I got 100% scholarship.

450
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:07,440
 And for me, if you don't know seminaries, they don't give much scholarships.

451
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,160
 So for me, this was just incredible, God providing.

452
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:16,080
 So now I was in California, I was going there to clear up my stuff, and move to Texas to

453
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,800
 go to seminary, but I was on this mountain, and all these things had happened.

454
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:28,720
 And I was just amazed how God had changed my life and the plans for my life.

455
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,840
 Now this is my messy journey.

456
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,560
 And certainly maybe I didn't do everything in the perfect way in that process, but that

457
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,600
 was just my journey.

458
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,080
 And I also want to be very clear, I believe that God doesn't call most people to be pastors

459
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,160
 or do mission work.

460
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:54,560
 I believe most people He calls us to workplaces, where He has something specific He wants us

461
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:00,280
 to do in an organization, or He calls us in a family to do something there, or maybe through

462
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,600
 the church and the community, so I just also want to be very clear on that.

463
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:14,280
 But this brings us back to that question, if God speaks to us, how do we respond to

464
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,040
 His leading?

465
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,520
 Do we say yes to Him?

466
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
 Do we surrender to Him?

467
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,540
 Do we say, "Lord, not my way, but Your way?"

468
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:31,240
 And so I want to give six things to keep in mind when we respond to God's leading.

469
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,320
 When you sense that God is speaking to you and you're trying to process this, I want

470
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,280
 to give six things, so up here behind me.

471
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,240
 The first one is, ask, "Is this leading truly from God?"

472
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,400
 Now the last thing I want is that people are quitting their jobs, and two years later,

473
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:54,500
 they're like, "I quit the job because of your sermon, and nothing has happened, what's

474
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,000
 wrong with you?"

475
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,520
 So we do need to discern.

476
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,760
 Is this really God?

477
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,920
 And of course, scripture, looking at scripture, is this in line with scripture?

478
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,480
 But the other thing is, do talk to some trusted friends, your community group, your pastor,

479
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,200
 ask them to pray with you, ask them to give their perspective, people that love you, that

480
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,360
 know you, and get their input.

481
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,640
 Now ultimately, you still will own your decision, you'll take ownership of your decision, but

482
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:27,920
 do get the input from others, invite them into the discerning process with you.

483
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,200
 That's the first thing.

484
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,880
 The second thing is, a lot of times when you do get a word from God where he asks us to

485
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,240
 do something, there is a lot of fear.

486
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:46,000
 You know, there is complaining, "I don't want anything to change."

487
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,880
 And these fears that come up, they can drive us away from God, or they can actually draw

488
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,720
 us closer to God.

489
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,400
 And I just want to encourage you to engage with God, bring your fears to God, ask Him

490
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,760
 to meet you in that, as you're wrestling with what He's saying to you, as you're trying

491
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,400
 to figure out and make sense.

492
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,200
 It comes unexpected, we can't prepare for that God will suddenly speak to us in our

493
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,600
 house or in our workplace and has this direction-changing word for us.

494
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,800
 Third thing, seek answers to your questions from God.

495
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,720
 Mary asked, "How will this be?"

496
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,720
 I had questions about my leadership, "Can I even do this?

497
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,920
 Am I even the right type of person for this sort of stuff?"

498
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,680
 Now Mary got an answer right away for me, it was like seven months, eight months later.

499
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,360
 But ask God questions, He welcomes our questions and He does respond to us.

500
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,960
 Maybe not always in the timing when we want to, maybe not even in the way that we want

501
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,680
 to, but He does respond to us, so bring your questions to God.

502
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,760
 And the fourth one is surrender to God's will.

503
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,080
 There's a point where we actually have to make a decision, are we going to say yes to

504
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,560
 what God wants to do?

505
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,200
 Are we going to be like Mary, "I am the Lord's servant, may your word to me be fulfilled."

506
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:16,000
 Now are we actually going to say that, "Lord, I'm available, I trust you, even though I

507
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,600
 don't understand everything, even though I don't know how to do everything, I'm just

508
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,120
 going to say yes to you because I know who you are."

509
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,960
 So there's that point where we actually have to make that decision, and then when fear

510
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:36,440
 arises, because it will along the way, I was freaked out when I talked to my parents.

511
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,760
 All their anxieties I suddenly felt, and I wondered myself, did I make the biggest mistake

512
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
 of my life?

513
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,080
 Did I hear God wrong?

514
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:51,560
 And what do we do when those fears start to overwhelm us, and they start drowning us?

515
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,000
 Well, we need to look to God.

516
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,760
 Nothing is impossible with God.

517
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:10,640
 God is with us, you know, those were two affirmations to Mary, and we need to remember who God is.

518
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,160
 Now when I was a youth pastor early on here in Hong Kong, I started off in one of the

519
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,200
 youth groups, and for a year nothing was happening.

520
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,800
 And I really was struggling, am I the right guy for this?

521
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,840
 And I wrestled, did I hear you wrong, am I in the wrong place?

522
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:35,740
 And God, as I was looking at God, I was like, no, God brought me here.

523
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,200
 This was not my idea, this was God's idea.

524
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,520
 And He knows me even better than I know myself, and He knows the people who are better than

525
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,920
 myself, and if this is His idea to have me here, then I must be the right person, even

526
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,280
 though right now I might not seem this way.

527
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,600
 That really gave me comfort and courage, just remember God even understands me better than

528
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,880
 I understand myself.

529
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:02,120
 And then finally, we discover the joy that comes from walking in God's calling.

530
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,280
 Now the joy doesn't come always right away.

531
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,800
 I'm sure that Mary initially, even though there was also excitement with the Messiah

532
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,140
 part, it was quite costly, quite heavy to say yes to what God was asking you to do.

533
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:18,880
 But even in this next, if you just read on a little bit, there's actually the magnificat

534
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,920
 where Mary praises God, where there is joy.

535
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,080
 And so joy comes later, and it is that surprising joy of being obedient to God.

536
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,960
 It doesn't mean that what we're doing is easy, God asks us to do things that are outside

537
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,760
 of our comfort zone a lot of times, that are a lot of times challenging, that might never

538
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:46,080
 be super easy, but we can know His presence, we can know His power, we can know His goodness,

539
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:53,440
 and there is joy in also just being used by God, even if it's not easy.

540
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,800
 And so we're surprised by joy.

541
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,920
 Now I want to invite the worship team to come up, and I don't know what your thinking has

542
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,600
 been or what you have been processing as I've been sharing a message on Mary and how she

543
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:18,000
 responded to this announcement from this angel that he gave her, and even my own story.

544
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,960
 If there are some words from God that maybe you're right now wrestling with, maybe they're

545
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,040
 not, but I actually want to just encourage you even with these six points, if there's

546
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,720
 something that God is inviting you to do, I actually just want to give a moment for

547
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,080
 you to respond to God.

548
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,960
 And so why don't we do this right now, just give a moment of just talking to God about

549
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,040
 what He's been speaking to you through His service, and then afterwards I'll pray for

550
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
 us.

551
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
 So why don't we do this?

552
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
 Just take a minute.

553
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,040
 [Prayer]

554
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
 [Prayer]

555
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
 [Prayer]

556
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
 [Prayer]

557
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
 [Prayer]

558
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:02,040
 [Prayer]

559
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:09,040
 [Prayer]

560
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:16,040
 [Prayer]

561
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:23,040
 [Prayer]

562
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:39,160
 As I was praying before the service, I just had the sense that some of us are actually

563
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,000
 wrestling with the question, "Who am I?

564
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,440
 Why are you asking me to do this?"

565
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:54,340
 Where we feel like we're not qualified, where we feel unworthy, maybe even just because

566
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:02,800
 of our past history of what we've done or didn't do.

567
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,040
 But God, He qualifies the unqualified.

568
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:21,680
 You know, when He calls us, He's saying that you can do this by His grace.

569
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,840
 And I just sense that God wants to encourage some of us who are struggling with this, who

570
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:32,440
 don't perceive ourselves as a person that God might use or that are really wrestling

571
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:39,280
 with the Word that God has given you.

572
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:49,440
 But if He sees you this way, if He's inviting you into this, who He knows who you are better

573
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:57,920
 than you know yourself, then you, by His grace, will be able to do what He's asking you to

574
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
 do.

575
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:14,840
 I also had the sense that there might be a few of us where we're actually making excuses.

576
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,880
 Where we're like, "Oh, I'm not prepared enough.

577
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
 I haven't studied.

578
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
 I haven't..."

579
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,320
 You know, whatever you're saying.

580
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:35,920
 And my sense is that God is inviting us to stop with excuses and actually just surrender

581
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,920
 to Him.

582
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,880
 And that's what it means to be a Christian.

583
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,040
 It means to be under the Lordship of Jesus.

584
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,360
 Not my will, not my way, but yours be done.

585
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:56,160
 I want to invite everyone to stand.

586
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,000
 And whether you have a specific thing that God is right now talking to you about or you

587
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,080
 don't, like one important thing is actually that we're just available to God, that we're

588
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,080
 surrendered to God.

589
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,000
 I believe that God is just inviting us to surrender to Him, to just make ourselves available

590
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,080
 to Him.

591
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,200
 I am the Lord's servant.

592
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,480
 May your word be fulfilled to me.

593
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,880
 That we just say that to God.

594
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,120
 You know, like, "Lord, I'm here.

595
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,840
 Use me in whatever way you choose to."

596
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:31,880
 So if this is something that you desire or you feel the Holy Spirit nudging you in this,

597
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,600
 I just want to invite you to stretch out your hands before you just as a posture of surrender

598
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,960
 and openness to God.

599
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,080
 I just want to pray over you.

600
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:58,240
 Jesus, I thank you so much that you qualify us even though we're unqualified.

601
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:06,400
 But it's your grace that is so mighty, so powerful that qualifies us.

602
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,680
 I thank you for every heart surrendered to you.

603
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:17,640
 Lord, my heart is that we all just regularly surrender to you, that we are a church that

604
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,280
 is available to you.

605
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:26,480
 It just says, "Yes, Lord, use us in whatever way you have for us."

606
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:37,360
 And so I just thank you right now for everyone who is making themselves available to you,

607
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,040
 saying, "Yes, Lord, have your way in me.

608
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,880
 Not my will but yours be done."

609
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,320
 May you just encourage them, lead them in what you have for them.

610
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,880
 Or just assure them that what they're doing is what you have for them right now, Lord,

611
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,920
 whatever it may be.

612
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,680
 And so we just bring all this before you.

613
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:04,160
 We thank you that you invite us into your work by your grace, that you do incredible

614
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,440
 and beautiful things through your people and have always done.

615
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,040
 And we desire to see that, Lord.

616
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,080
 We long for that in our own personal lives but also as a community.

617
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,480
 And so we just give you all the praise and glory.

618
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,600
 And we thank you, Jesus, that you came into these humble circumstances to save us, to

619
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:30,200
 redeem us, to show us grace, and to invite us into your life.

620
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,040
 We praise you in your name, Jesus.

621
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,320
 Amen.

622
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:42,120
 Let's sing this together.
