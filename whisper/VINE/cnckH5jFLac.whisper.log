[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Well, good morning, Church.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   It's really good to be with you all today.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.440]   I'm excited to come and share the Word with you.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.000]   So we're just going to get right into it, all right?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.520]   Let me start with a question.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.520]   As you've been walking around the streets here in Hong Kong, have you ever seen people
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.560]   on the streets trying to sell something?
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.000]   It's quite a common sight where we are.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.880]   You know, actually right in the corner of Wan Chai Road, there's a little space next
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.400]   to the Cha Siu place.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.160]   There's a little space and it's always rented out.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.680]   And you know, it's always rented out to people who are trying to sell different things.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.680]   There's always someone trying to sell something out of that spot.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.000]   I've seen frying pans, Chinese herbs, mops, diffusers, these magic cloths that seem to
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.200]   be able to clean everything, cushion covers, sometimes it's lavender, compression socks,
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.000]   underwear sometimes, and most recently, RAT test kits and face masks.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.800]   These like $6 RAT test kits.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.200]   I don't know how reliable they are, okay?
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.880]   $6 apparently.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.320]   But I love watching these people because they have a way to work the crowd.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.600]   They know how to make a sale.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.280]   And after you observe them for a little while, you figure out there's a method in what they're
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.900]   doing.
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.560]   So it goes a bit like this, okay?
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.000]   First, they're very good at getting the attention of just one or two people.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.400]   You know, often they're just kind of like talking to themselves, kind of like practicing
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.160]   the sales pitch, I guess, but inevitably, there's always one slightly middle-aged person
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.120]   that comes walking along, you know, the old man that's kind of walking like this, you
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.040]   know, and he kind of comes along and they make the very, very big mistake of showing
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.000]   the slightest bit of interest and suddenly, boom, they're hooked.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   [foreign language]
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.160]   You know, and one slight bit of interest and they're hooked, all right?
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160]   And then comes the sales pitch.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.760]   And these are where these people really excel because whatever it is they're selling, they
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.920]   can make it seem like you need it desperately right now.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.880]   And not only you, right, your whole entire family needs this as well.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.080]   You're going to, and if you don't buy it right now, you're going to miss a once in a lifetime
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.880]   opportunity.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.280]   And all they need, again, is just one person, one person to make a purchase, right?
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.280]   And then that's it.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.200]   You're allowed to begin to gather, right?
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.840]   Even during the pandemic, Hong Kong people love to gather together if there is a deal
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.360]   in place, right?
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.560]   Gather together and block the entire pavement.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.640]   And after that, one person makes the sale, one person choose to make the purchase, then
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.880]   the rest fall like flies, right?
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.160]   They're handing over fistfuls of cash, "Hey, I need this, I need this," and grabbing as
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.800]   many as they can.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.000]   And that's how I ended up with five USB-powered tabletop blenders that apparently you can
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.720]   put all your vegetables and fruit in.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.640]   You know, it's a really easy way to have your fruit and veg and healthy way to keep, maintain
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640]   a balanced diet.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.120]   And if you want one of those, today I'm offering you a once in a lifetime opportunity, all
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   right?
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.160]   Just slide into my DMs, 70 Hong Kong dollars, all right, and you can have one.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.720]   I've got them orange, pink, and red, whatever color you want.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.200]   I can sort you out for that too.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.240]   You know, Pastor Andrew started us on a journey through Acts a couple of weeks ago, and we
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.580]   continue on this journey today.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.360]   But the question we have at hand today is this, how do we share the gospel?
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.400]   Sometimes, sometimes sharing the gospel, right, does feel like we're salesperson trying to
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   make a sales pitch, convince these people that we have something that they need.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.960]   Maybe if Peter was working in that corner, he'd be selling something like this, right?
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.320]   Come and buy the most comfortable sandals this side of the Galilee, the one and only
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.760]   Jerusalem cruisers, you know, whether you are walking on the Red Sea or hiking up to
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.680]   the Temple Mount, these sandals are the only things that you'll ever need.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.640]   I should probably get a part-time job at that place, right?
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.960]   But what Peter's doing, he's not selling a gimmicky product in this speech.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.460]   Now his speech is courageous, provocative, and truly life-changing to those who choose
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.480]   to respond to it, because Peter is proclaiming the gospel.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.380]   So let me just give you a quick reminder of what's happened up until this point.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.640]   If you remember, it's Pentecost, and the Holy Spirit has come, and the disciples are speaking
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.560]   in these foreign languages, and people are kind of reconciling in a way that they've
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.480]   never seen before.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.920]   But also some people think, "What's going on here?
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.920]   It's absolutely crazy."
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.920]   Some people are amazed, some people think that the disciples are drunk, but Peter explains,
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.920]   "No, people are not drunk.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.480]   This is not crazy, but rather it's the Holy Spirit that is at work in this moment.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.260]   And because the Holy Spirit is at work, you need to listen to what I'm about to tell you."
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.900]   And so my hope for us today is this.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.680]   As we study Peter's declaration of the gospel, we will all be inspired to do the same.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.900]   After all, for those of you who are Christian, for those of you who follow Jesus with your
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.880]   lives, isn't the gospel the best news that you've ever received?
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.900]   And surely if this is the best news that we've ever received, we want other people to know
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.520]   just how amazing it is.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.920]   You know, the heartache that we've gone through as a city, the disunity that we've seen within
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.760]   our society, the mistrust between people groups, and the general sense of hopelessness as we
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.240]   look into the future, there is an answer to these things.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.200]   We desperately need to heal, and we're crying out for hope as a family and as a city.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:53.420]   And one of the best ways I believe we can bring hope into a time like this is to proclaim
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.420]   the gospel.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.820]   Now, of course, it's not an easy thing to do, and the thought of sharing the gospel
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.760]   might be super intimidating.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.920]   You might even say, you know, "Well, evangelism is just not my thing.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.620]   I'm going to leave that to the people who are good at it to do that."
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.020]   But the point of today is to challenge that perspective a little bit, church.
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.080]   Because telling people about the gospel is really something all of us can do, and I would
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.120]   even say have been called to do.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.580]   And hopefully today we're going to learn some methods and some tactics just to encourage
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.880]   and to empower you a little bit more to this call that God has given to you to share the
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   gospel.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.960]   We're going to turn to God's word in order to be able to do that.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.500]   So we're going to be in Acts 2, starting in verse 22.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.500]   Follow with me, church.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.300]   It says this, "Fellow Israelites, listen to this.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:56.460]   Jesus of Nazareth, a man accredited to you by God by miracles, wonders, and signs, which
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.520]   God did among you through him.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.500]   As you yourselves know, this man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge,
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.200]   and you with the help of wicked men put him to death by nailing him to the cross.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.540]   But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death because it was
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:21.800]   impossible for death to hold him down."
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.320]   Have you ever had a moment when you were in the middle of a conversation and then suddenly
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.640]   you just get this undeniable urge to talk about Jesus?
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.660]   I think I spoke about this the last time I preached a little bit, right?
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.540]   But you feel it in your chest, your brain kind of zooms in on it.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.800]   You might start to feel a little bit nervous or excited even.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.860]   Your heart starts to beat a little bit faster because at this moment you are sure, you know
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.560]   there's an opportunity to share the gospel.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.520]   Now what do we do in those moments?
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.420]   It can be a little conflicting, right?
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.240]   Because like I said, on the one hand you're excited and you're keen to share the gospel.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.520]   However, on the other hand you might be thinking, "Well what if these people think I'm weird?
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.040]   What if I get rejected?
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.520]   What if it comes off as like this cheesy sales pitch?"
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.320]   But we can take notes from Peter here.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.160]   Notice how Peter reacts to this situation.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.880]   Peter rises to the occasion.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.680]   That's the first step we have to take.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.440]   When the opportunity comes, we have to rise to the occasion.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.160]   And he begins to explain and unpack what is happening.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.800]   He makes the most of this moment to proclaim the truth of the gospel to anybody who's willing
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.400]   to listen to it.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.440]   Now again, you might be thinking, "Well that was Peter, right?
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.720]   Peter was Jesus' best mate.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.280]   He followed Jesus around.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.960]   There was no big deal for Peter to do something like that."
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.320]   But again, we have to remember, Peter wasn't always this bold person.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.280]   Peter was in fact a man of many, many failures.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.840]   He was impatient and hot-headed.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.960]   He often said the wrong thing.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.880]   Just look at his track record, you know.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.200]   He starts to walk on the water but loses faith and begins to drown.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.680]   He falls asleep when he's supposed to be praying, something that I relate to very, very much
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.480]   indeed.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.960]   The night before Jesus was crucified, he denies he knows Jesus on three different occasions.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.760]   And after Jesus' death, Peter is so down, he almost gives up on his mission altogether
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.800]   and goes back to fishing.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:36.320]   Peter was a sinful, broken human being just like us.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.740]   But yet he learned what it meant to be bold and courageous when it came to declaring the
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.080]   truth of who Jesus is and what he had done.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.560]   It might feel like the work of sharing the gospel is reserved for a select few people
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.080]   who are good at it.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.960]   We might not even feel like we're qualified to speak about Jesus because of things we
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.420]   feel like we've done in our past.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.200]   But this is a reminder for us, church.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.840]   And Peter's example is proof that when you're willing to share the gospel, you're not just
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   doing it in your own power.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.580]   But the Holy Spirit comes upon you and empowers you and guides you and gives you the confidence
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.820]   and the words to speak in those moments.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:22.840]   Despite of all of Peter's shortcomings, through the Holy Spirit, he was empowered to share
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.680]   the gospel.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.840]   And that's why I believe every single person, including you, yes, you and me and every single
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.360]   person who decides to be brave, who decides to let the Holy Spirit work through them,
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.040]   can also share the gospel in those moments of opportunity.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.440]   So you've recognized the moment.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.740]   You know that there's an opportunity that needs to be seized.
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.280]   Now what?
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.800]   What do you actually say?
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.400]   Well, step two is this, church.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.540]   When you open your mouth, you declare the life, death, and the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.320]   These three things, the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, are crucial components when it comes
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.460]   to presenting the gospel.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.520]   And I'm going to get a little bit theological but also a bit practical here.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.600]   So please stay with me, church.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.400]   Listen again to Peter's words.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.520]   Firstly, verse 22, he declares who Jesus is.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.640]   Fellow Israelites, listen to this.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:28.920]   Jesus of Nazareth, a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.760]   God did among you through him.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.560]   What Peter's doing here is Peter's acknowledging Jesus' existence as a real person.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.720]   He's saying, "You knew this man.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   You've seen him.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.720]   You've seen him.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720]   He lived among you.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   He breathed the same air.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   He ate the same food.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.720]   He slept.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.440]   He was functioning among you.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.200]   You've seen him with your own eyes."
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.520]   Jesus from Nazareth, that's how people identified themselves back in the day.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.240]   But at the same time, Jesus wasn't just an ordinary man, right?
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.800]   He performed signs and wonders and miracles.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.080]   And when we read through the gospels, we see Jesus was indeed able to do things that no
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.200]   other person could do.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.640]   He gives sight to the blind.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.960]   He makes the lame walk again.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.040]   He approaches lepers to make them clean.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.480]   He gives voice to the mute.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.680]   He casts out evil spirits.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.760]   And yes, he even raises the dead back to life.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.880]   And Peter's saying here, "All these miracles are proof that even though Jesus was a man
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.480]   that lived among us, he wasn't an ordinary man.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:38.600]   Rather, a man who was so filled with the power of presence of God, it was as if God himself
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.760]   was living amongst us."
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.480]   Jesus says this in John 15, 9, about John 5, 19, sorry, about himself.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   "Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.760]   He can only do what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does, the Son
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.120]   does also."
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.760]   What Peter's trying to do and what we need to understand is that, yes, these miracles
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:10.200]   that Jesus performed in the course of his life and his ministry are proof that Jesus
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:16.680]   was uniquely God's Son sent by him to this earth.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.160]   So how do we declare Jesus with our lives today?
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.800]   Well, there's a few different ways.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.480]   Firstly, we need to learn how to actually talk about him.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.440]   This means we need to read our Bibles, spend time in God's Word, especially spend time
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:38.160]   in the Gospels, fall in love with the stories of Jesus, practice telling stories about the
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.120]   things that he did, because they are truly amazing.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.760]   As followers of Jesus, talking about him should be like talking about your best friend, your
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.800]   spouse, your partner, your child, someone that you admire deeply.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.320]   Also learn and practice how to talk and share stories about Jesus.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.840]   But we can't just talk about it, church.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.040]   We also need to live our lives as Jesus lived.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.840]   Let me say something very clear at this point.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.160]   Preaching the Gospel has to be done with more than just our words.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.760]   Now I know, most of us aren't going around doing supernatural miracles on the daily,
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.080]   we don't do those kind of things, but we all have giftings and talents, things we're good
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:30.440]   at, which we can use towards proclaiming who Jesus is.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.080]   We can use these things to love and serve people in the same way that we see Jesus did
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.080]   in the Gospels.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:43.120]   How are you, church, using these God-given gifts and abilities to reach out to those
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:51.480]   who are hurting, to feed the hungry, to seek justice for those who are lost in darkness?
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.920]   The way we live should reflect who Jesus is.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.460]   This is how we become the hands and feet of Christ today.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:05.000]   Along with our words, our actions point people towards Jesus.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.440]   And when we do this, it's like we're replicating the miracles of Jesus.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.400]   It's like these people are so different.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.520]   Why is this person helping me?
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:19.760]   Doing these things, it's like doing the miracles that Jesus did while He was here on this earth.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.280]   And this is what a life empowered by the Gospel looks like.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.760]   So yes, Jesus lived a powerful life while He was on this earth, and He's called us to
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.920]   do the same.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:38.160]   But one of the most astonishing things about Jesus is that even in death, even in His death,
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.200]   there was great power.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.200]   Let's read on to see what Peter says.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:50.000]   This man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge, and you, with the
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.200]   help of wicked men, put Him to death by nailing Him to the cross.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.880]   Peter's talking about sin and death here.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:06.040]   The death of Jesus is probably the most tragic and unjust event in the entire course of history
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.820]   of the world.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.760]   As we have discovered, we've just said Jesus was sent by God on this earth to teach us,
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.880]   to guide us, to love us, to save us.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.480]   But we also see that while Jesus was on this earth, He was often despised.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.600]   He was often rejected by the very ones who He was called to love.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:34.280]   Nevertheless, Jesus comes, full well knowing that sinful human beings would be the ones
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:40.600]   who execute Him through the brutal method of crucifixion.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.360]   Yet He came to love.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.700]   But here's the amazing thing.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:50.160]   At the same time, even though we crucified Jesus on the cross, His death becomes the
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.240]   ultimate sign of victory.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.920]   This is one of the paradoxes of Jesus' death.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.240]   In the commentary I found it said it like this.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.200]   It was engineered and carried out by human beings, whilst at the same time it was the
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.360]   climax of God's plan of salvation.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.420]   And this is why if you read stories about Jesus, He was able to talk about His death
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.560]   so freely.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.740]   This is why Jesus continued His journey to the cross despite all the pain and humiliation
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.640]   that He felt along the way.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.240]   This is why even while He was on the cross about to die, He was able to minister to the
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.800]   women around Him.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:34.560]   He was able to talk to the thief crying out for rescue, even though He Himself was about
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.300]   to die.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:41.060]   This is why His last words on the cross were, "It is finished."
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:45.760]   Because He knew that through His death, the greatest rescue mission in the world had been
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.760]   accomplished.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:55.120]   Yes, church, sin and death are very much part of the gospel story.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.720]   And when we see the way Jesus lived, when we see the way Jesus talked, He was never
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:05.800]   afraid to talk about the different ways that we as human beings have messed up and sinned.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.560]   He was never afraid to point out the effects of sin.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.200]   Scripture is very clear.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.280]   All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.200]   And the wages of those sin is death.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.780]   So this is what this means for us.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:27.560]   The gospel means that we have to embrace those who are lost in sin, not being afraid of the
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.360]   messiness that might come with it.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:35.040]   This means again, speaking up against systems of cruelty and injustice.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.800]   This means standing with the weak and the vulnerable and the oppressed because this
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.880]   is exactly what Jesus did in His life.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.000]   All this too is part of proclaiming the gospel.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.840]   But church, this does not mean that we go around bashing and condemning people for their
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.440]   sin, threatening them with the punishment of hell.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:04.080]   Yes, sin is serious and it needs to be dealt with, but it's not done by Christians judging,
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.240]   pointing fingers, acting haughty and holier than thou.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:14.120]   In fact, I would say this, one of the best ways to talk about sin is to share and be
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.880]   honest about your own struggles.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:24.120]   Because we as Christians, we have a tendency maybe to perhaps that we are above these things,
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.840]   that we don't have any issues, pretend like we're immune to the life's challenges and
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.240]   the things that are happening around us.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.680]   And it can give up the impression that we have it all figured out, but if we're just
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:41.560]   honest with ourselves for just one second, this is clearly not the case.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:47.320]   So when you speak about the gospel, speak also about your own brokenness.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.120]   Acknowledge that the gospel is something you need just as much as anyone else.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.480]   And hopefully you'll find, you know, as we approach the conversation from this perspective,
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:02.280]   right, of this is what the gospel has done for me, rather than you're a sin that needs
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:07.600]   to hear about Jesus, I think you'll find that people are a lot more open to hearing you
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.680]   out.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.360]   And yes, these things are going to be hard to talk about.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.080]   It's going to take courage to be open and to be vulnerable.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:22.560]   It's going to be a risk, but it's a risk worth taking because people need to know that sin
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.220]   and death are not the end.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:30.480]   We need people to know that the gospel is actually a triumphant message of love and
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.840]   hope.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.560]   So let's be honest.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.880]   Let's be vulnerable.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.160]   But let's also proclaim that because we can be open and honest about these things, we
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.240]   don't need to be a slave to sin and death.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:50.080]   And we're not afraid of these things because in the gospel, death actually becomes a victory.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:56.760]   Jesus is alive and we can do and say and act to these things and love people in this way
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.400]   because we have the hope of resurrection.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.200]   Listen to these powerful and triumphant words Peter continues with.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.460]   But God raised him, that's Jesus from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:15.880]   because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.960]   If the death of Jesus is one of the most tragic and unjust things, the resurrection from Jesus
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.640]   is one of the most mysterious and yet wonderful truths about our Christian faith.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.880]   Yes, church, Jesus died on the cross.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.320]   But the reason we have hope, the reason we know that he wasn't just an ordinary man is
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:43.320]   that what Peter has just said here, it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.000]   You have to understand this, right?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.440]   Nobody is supposed to be able to escape death.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.760]   Nobody.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.860]   Death is like a prison that once you go in, there's no coming back.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:59.980]   Dead people do not generally escape death and come back to life.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:06.780]   The reason why we as a church, we as followers of Jesus can confront this thing of sin and
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:13.820]   even death is because, like I said, we have the reassurance of the resurrection.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:20.900]   The key to the gospel message is the declaration that as his followers, we too can share with
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.800]   Jesus in his resurrection.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.260]   Peter really wants to drive this home.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:31.440]   And if you continue to read in Acts chapter 2, he goes into Psalm 16 and a few other Psalms
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:37.300]   written by King David and he points out that King David himself, right, he was the archetype
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.260]   leader of Israel back then.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:46.260]   But King David himself once prophesied about who Jesus is and what he would do.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:51.100]   Peter explains to his audience that these Psalms that King David writes about future
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:57.260]   resurrection wasn't about himself, but it was actually a prophecy about Jesus's coming
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.700]   and his resurrection.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.900]   And this was to be the ultimate sign.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:07.580]   The ultimate sign that would let all of Israel know that their Savior had returned, that
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:14.100]   the wait was finally over, would be the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.940]   So the resurrection, therefore, church, is what gives the gospel power.
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:23.460]   The resurrection lets us know that a new era has begun.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.260]   The kingdom of God is finally here.
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:31.580]   And as we wait for Jesus to return for the second time, we get to do the work of spreading
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:37.620]   the gospel, of bringing his kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:41.420]   This means that we as his believers get to live in this reality, right?
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:47.020]   We're actively waiting for Jesus' return by living this gospel-driven life that we're
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.300]   talking about.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:54.380]   And though this is why we can be bold and courageous when we share the gospel.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.020]   This is why you see some people go as far as to risking their lives, going to the most
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:04.460]   dangerous of places to live amongst the most difficult of situations to tell people about
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:12.100]   Jesus because they know that even if they lose their life in this, resurrection awaits.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.620]   The theologian N.T.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.340]   Wright says it this way.
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:20.660]   The good news, no, the great news of Jesus is that with his resurrection, it becomes
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:26.820]   clear not only that he is Messiah and Lord, but that in his death, he has dealt with evil
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:34.580]   itself, a blow from which though still retains some power, it will never recover.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:39.140]   This is the message of hope the world needs to hear.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:45.260]   The resurrection means that we can live and love sacrificially even to the point of death
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.740]   because death is not the end.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:55.140]   Imagine then, what would it be like if we really lived a life that believed in this
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.660]   truth?
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.660]   If everyone was willing to live their lives this way?
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.780]   Well, we can and that's what we're supposed to do.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:09.540]   And when we share the gospel, we have to offer people an invitation into this lifestyle as
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.540]   well.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.660]   So this is step three.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:19.220]   We offer people an invitation to live their lives in this power of hope and resurrection.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.420]   As Peter comes to the end of this, end of his speech, this is the last crucial step
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.420]   he takes.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:31.860]   You see, the point of him preaching this message wasn't just to tell an amazing story.
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:37.060]   Rather, it's to help the people realize this is something, if you don't know about it,
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.940]   if you haven't heard about it, you need to respond to this.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:46.620]   The Bible is not just a story of ancient texts from thousands of years ago, but the Word
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:53.580]   of God is described as active, like a double-edged sword, profitable for teaching, training,
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.060]   and righteousness.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.860]   And this is exactly what we see happening as Peter proclaims the gospel.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:04.660]   Look at the powerful response it elicits from the people hearing it.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:10.780]   Verse 37, "When people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:15.640]   other apostles, 'Brothers, what shall we do?'
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:21.980]   Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:27.420]   the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:33.860]   This promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, for all whom
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:40.020]   call the Lord, sorry, excuse me, for all whom the Lord our God will call.'
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.980]   And with many other words he warned them and pleaded with them, 'Save yourselves from this
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.020]   corrupt generation.'
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:52.220]   Those who accepted this message were baptized and about 3,000 were added to the number that
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.860]   day."
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.060]   So maybe I'll put it this way.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:02.180]   Have you ever felt the feeling, you know, suddenly you've realized, "Oh man, I've made
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.780]   a huge mistake."
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.520]   I get this sometimes.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.220]   Maybe it's the time your wife told you, "Hey, can you remember to take the meat out the
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.780]   freezer please before you leave today?"
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.500]   And you're like, "Okay, okay."
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.940]   And you ignore it and you forget about it.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.420]   And you didn't do it because you're watching TV and then suddenly it's 5 p.m. and then
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.320]   your wife calls you and say, "Hey, you took the meat out the freezer this morning, right?"
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.820]   And you just have this big question mark in your head.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.820]   Oh.
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:33.620]   Remember, the Israelites have been waiting for this Messiah.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:38.060]   Since the glorious days of King David, they've been waiting for a new king to lead them in
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.100]   victory over their enemies.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.780]   And God sent Jesus as this Messiah.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:49.940]   He came, He lived amongst them, He showed them love, He did miracles, but they did not
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.740]   recognize Him.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.700]   And so they killed Him.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.300]   Suddenly in this moment, these people have realized their error.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.320]   They've realized their sin.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:05.240]   So now they're asking, "What can we do?"
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.420]   And after hearing this message, people were distraught.
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.980]   The reaction is, "What shall we do?
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.700]   Is there any hope?"
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.540]   Notice here that there's a deep, genuine recognition of the sorrow over their sin.
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.960]   It says here that they were cut to the heart.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.100]   This is an important part of our journey in sharing the gospel and sharing the gospel
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.020]   with someone else too.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.780]   A true recognition of sin is needed.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:37.740]   Otherwise, people will never truly recognize their real need for Jesus.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.520]   This is one of those painful yet beautiful moments in life.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:48.240]   This is one of those moments where you realize that your sin, where you realize your sin
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:56.180]   and that unless Jesus comes to rescue you, you're headed for disaster.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.060]   What I'm trying to say is this.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.180]   The gospel demands a response.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:06.660]   So as we share the gospel, as we love people, as we stand by those who are hurting, we have
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.700]   to be ready for a shift to happen in these people's lives.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.020]   Be ready for the gospel to make an impact on them.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.540]   Now this isn't to say this is going to happen every time.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:21.680]   We also have to be careful not to coerce people into responding in ways that are not genuine
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.240]   to them.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.800]   Peter doesn't try to manipulate the situation anyway.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.140]   He simply presents the truth.
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:33.680]   He presents the facts as they are and he lets the power of God's Word and the Holy Spirit
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.200]   do the work in the lives of those who are hearing it.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.160]   But when it does happen, we need to be ready.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:46.860]   And we need to be ready to receive people when they choose to take this next step.
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:53.300]   And this is when we offer the invitation to them to declare who Jesus is in their lives.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.780]   So Peter ends with an invitation.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.280]   He tells them to repent.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:04.060]   He tells them to be baptized, know Jesus, embrace forgiveness, receive the Holy Spirit
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:08.900]   and join with us in new community.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.900]   Repent.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.700]   You know, when Peter points out the sin in people's lives, it's not just to make them
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.820]   feel bad about themselves and to wallow in their sorrow.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.900]   His point is not to judge them and condemn them.
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:29.820]   He tells people to repent because repentance is the first step in our journey towards Jesus.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.820]   Repentance is more than just feeling sorry for ourselves.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.100]   The word itself means to turn back, right?
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.940]   And when we turn back to our sins, it implies that we have a change of heart.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.480]   We confess the things that we have done wrong.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.300]   This is one of the most beautiful things as we start to share the gospel is how it really
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:55.500]   makes life-changing things happen in people's lives.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.920]   I've seen the powerful effects in my own life itself.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.580]   When I've come to the places in seasons when I was wrestling with sin, trying to hide it
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:09.660]   in my life and finally coming to a place where I could truly confess and repent, if I'd held
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.920]   it in, I knew it would have been more devastating for me.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:19.060]   But this is the power of repentance, that people who are heading into a life of destruction
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:26.940]   of sin, realizing what they've done wrong and the Holy Spirit turning their lives around
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:31.080]   to enable them to live in lives of freedom.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.680]   So we repent.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:38.440]   But Peter also calls for the believers here to be baptized.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.640]   Baptism then becomes this public declaration of the faith that you've now chosen to walk
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.640]   in.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.860]   This is a sign that you've declared that I'm going to be rescued by Jesus.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.520]   It's a sign that you're following a new leader now.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:57.640]   You have a new king, a new Lord in your life, and you're not ashamed to tell the world who
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.180]   he is.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:03.400]   And so often at the Vine, we have baptisms coming up very soon.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.600]   If this is something God's been speaking to you about, then I encourage you to take that
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.560]   step of boldness, to be baptized.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:16.240]   In baptism, what we symbolize is us dying to our old lives.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.880]   Our sins are washed away, and we are raised to walking into a new life with Jesus as our
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.900]   Lord and Savior.
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:33.240]   But then Peter also says this, "Receive the Holy Spirit."
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:40.380]   So after we repent, we're baptized, something even more amazing happens.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.560]   You see, after we've repented, after we've received forgiveness, even after you've been
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.020]   baptized, the struggle with sin is still very real.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.320]   It doesn't mean that you're going to live an easy, sin-free life.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.840]   It doesn't mean you're still not going to wrestle with sin and temptation.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:02.300]   The devil is still going to try and move you away from God.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.520]   But this is where the Holy Spirit comes in.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:12.620]   Jesus promises the Holy Spirit as our helper to lead us and to guide us as we continue
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.880]   our journey in this world.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:19.800]   The Holy Spirit empowers us, enables us to do amazing and wonderful things, to live for
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:25.880]   God's name, to continue to represent Him in everything that we do.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:32.160]   The Holy Spirit encourages us to stay on the path toward Jesus until the day He returns.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.720]   So you don't do this journey alone.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.560]   The Holy Spirit is with you.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:46.880]   And in the end, 3,000 people, it says, come forward to repent, to be baptized, and to
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.840]   give their lives to Jesus.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.200]   And this is how the early church is birthed.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.840]   And it goes on in this chapter, it tells us that this community begins to grow.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.800]   And not only does it begin to grow in number, it begins to grow in the way they care and
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.600]   love each other.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.600]   They share everything.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:08.500]   They bring everything to the table and they look after each other in this radical, life-changing
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.480]   way, counter-cultural way.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.880]   This was the church that Jesus was trying to build.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:20.400]   And this is the church that God continues to want to build here on this earth.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.880]   This is the kind of church that Jesus wants to see us continue today.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.480]   And this is why we have to continue to be willing to spread the gospel, to invite people
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.720]   into this sort of community.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:37.480]   So as you share the gospel, of course, maybe not 3,000 people are going to give their lives
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.040]   to Jesus each time.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.800]   But what we're encouraged to do is to do our part.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.740]   It might be one person.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.440]   Maybe it will be 3,000 people.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.940]   Maybe it might be 30,000 people even.
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:56.580]   But as Christians, we have been called just to be faithful and keep on adding to this
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.100]   number.
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:06.000]   This is why church, what we're doing, the story of Acts is still an unfinished story.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.040]   Our call therefore is not to give up in spreading the gospel.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:16.160]   No matter where you are, no matter who you are, we continue to do this.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:23.380]   And we witness the expansion of God's kingdom as many more come to know Him.
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:29.660]   So this is my prayer for us as a church, as a community, that we'll be passionate about
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:35.220]   declaring His Word, that we would live the kind of life that Jesus lived, showing hope
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.900]   and compassion and love to those around us.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.640]   And as we do this, we see lives change.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.220]   We see people receive hope in the most hopeless of situations.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:57.480]   We see people embrace joy and understand the identity in life that God has given to them.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:02.980]   And we continue to do this until the day Jesus returns.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:10.060]   May this be what we're known for as we continue to heed God's call to spread the gospel in
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.580]   this city and around the world.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:19.020]   Would you pray with me, church?
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:23.720]   Father, we thank you for your story.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.420]   We thank you for your life.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:37.060]   We thank you that you came to dwell with us as unworthy as it was, as unworthy as we are
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.900]   for you to have lived among us, Lord.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:49.420]   You came, you showed us what a full, obedient life in God looks like.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:54.540]   And so, Jesus, as we continue to live out our lives here, in the different places you've
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:37:01.300]   put us in, in the families that we have, in our schools, in our workplaces, and with the
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.740]   gifts and talents you've given to us, Lord, we know that these things are not just for
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.740]   ourselves.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:12.220]   But Lord, you want to use us, you want to work through us, you want to partner with
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.840]   us in letting people know who you are.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:23.700]   There is a world out there that continues to be lost in hopelessness, in darkness, in
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:30.380]   thinking that there's no future for them, in thinking that this is it.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:38.420]   Lord, with the gospel that you've given to us, may we speak it out boldly, but we may
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.180]   also live it out bravely.
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:47.620]   And as we do this, church, as we do this, I pray that we would become a community that
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.940]   truly embraces those who are lost.
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:38:00.460]   I pray that many more lives would be changed because of the hope that they found in Jesus.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.100]   Use us for your purposes, Lord.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.220]   And Holy Spirit, I pray that you would give us wisdom and strength to do this by your
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.220]   power.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.620]   It's in your beautiful name we pray.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.380]   Amen.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.380]   [MUSIC]
