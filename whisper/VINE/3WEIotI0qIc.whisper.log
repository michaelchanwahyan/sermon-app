[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   Well, it's such an honor to be with you all this morning.
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.700]   I really mean that.
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.700]   It's an honor.
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.160]   You know, when you've lived the life that I've lived and done the things that I have
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.360]   done, you never take it for granted to be in a room with people like you guys.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.760]   So I'm grateful.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.200]   You know, whenever I share my story, it's hard to know exactly when to begin.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.760]   So I'm going to go right back to the beginning and we'll kind of go from there.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.320]   I was born into a family where me and my older brother were dearly and deeply loved by our
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.280]   father and mother.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.760]   From as early as I could remember, I was lavishly loved by them.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.760]   My family were the wealthiest family in all of our area, in all of our region.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.920]   My father was a farmer and he had made for himself this massive farm, bought all of this
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.640]   land and this land was all of his and he had made this life for us.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.320]   And we were known throughout the region for our prosperity, but also for my father's name,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.720]   for the respect that that name carried.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.600]   And as of course, in a certain way, the respect we carried because of him.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.900]   I mean, I had everything.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.060]   You should have seen some of the festivals that we held at our farm.
[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.040]   They were the most sought after, the most wanted to be at festivals during the festival
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.280]   time than any other farmer in that region.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.120]   We had the biggest house.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.060]   We had the most amount of cattle.
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.460]   We had the biggest amount of money.
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:40.520]   I had literally everything and I hated every minute of it.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.980]   I hated it because every day for me was a reminder that everything around me was not
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.240]   actually mine.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.040]   That everything around me was reeking of my father's success.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.960]   That every day I was put in front of me in my face, all of this stuff that my dad had
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.200]   done, the way he had been able to live his life, earn the respect and everything around
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.000]   me wasn't actually mine.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.120]   None of it spoke about my name.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.600]   None of it spoke about what I have achieved.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.320]   In fact, I felt like I had achieved nothing as I was surrounded and trapped by all of
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.600]   my father's everything.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.940]   I wonder if you've ever felt like that yourself.
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.720]   I would talk about this with my older brother all the time.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.880]   There was this one day where one of our hired men came to us and said, "Hey, one of the
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.400]   cattle right out on the east side of the field of the farm has passed away."
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.960]   And so I said to my brother, "Come on, let's go.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.520]   Let's go and have a look at this dead animal."
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.360]   And so we walked all the way out over there to the east side of the farm.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.800]   And I remember the day beautifully because as we were walking, the sun was setting majestically
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.600]   just behind us.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.220]   And we get to this dead animal and I pull my brother over and I say, "Brother, do you
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.280]   see this dead animal?"
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.480]   I said, "That's just how I feel inside.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.880]   I feel dead just like him."
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   My brother was like, "What are you talking about?
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.760]   I mean, are you stupid?
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   Are you mad?
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   I mean, get a life."
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.060]   And I'm like, "Yeah, that's exactly what I want.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.060]   I want to get a life.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.720]   I want to have a life for myself, a name for myself.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.120]   I want to take success and taste what success looks like just for me.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.400]   I don't want to get all this stuff from everyone else.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.760]   I feel like I'm torn up inside.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.200]   My brother thinks I'm an idiot."
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.120]   And this is the funny thing.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.680]   I knew that my brother felt exactly the same as I did.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.380]   And it was so typical, my older brother, so typical that he felt the same way, but he
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.160]   buried all that feeling inside.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.160]   He really wanted to make some sort of expression of how he felt, but he just kept his mouth
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   shut.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.200]   And I looked at him and I thought, "I'm not going to keep my mouth shut.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.320]   I'm going to change my situation even if he won't."
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.520]   The idea I came up with was truly genius.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.280]   When I look back on it now, I think of the audacity that I had.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.040]   I decided that I was going to ask my father for my inheritance.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.640]   Under Jewish law, a third of all of my father's assets and wealth were coming to me when he
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.100]   passed away, a third.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.760]   My older brother would get two thirds according to our Jewish customs.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.120]   I don't understand why he would get two thirds just because he was born a few years before
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   me.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.000]   Regardless, I was getting a third and a third of my father's stuff was a lot.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.040]   And I knew that if I was to ask him for this money, it was completely against our traditions.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.840]   You have to remember, I was about 18 years old at this time.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.920]   My father in his mid-fifties, he was going to live forever.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.240]   I couldn't wait that long.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.880]   I wanted that money, that inheritance right now.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.640]   And I knew, because I'm smart, I knew what I was asking.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.200]   I knew that if I asked him for that money, essentially I was saying that he was dead
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   to me.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.880]   Essentially, I was saying that I wanted to divorce from the family, that I no longer
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.600]   wanted to associate myself as a son of his.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.680]   I wanted that money now as if he was dead so I can go and do with that money as I please.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.440]   It was a genius idea.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.800]   Even more genius was how I did it.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.680]   My father, every day, would hold a meeting at the table.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.280]   The meeting at the table was designed to decide what the workload was going to be for that
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.280]   day.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.800]   And he would gather at the head of the table.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.000]   My older brother would sit here.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.040]   I was supposed to sit here, but I never bothered to go to this meeting because it was boring.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.440]   But I knew that my father here, with all of the hired men around the table, that the pressure
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.480]   of him saying yes to me would have increased.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.480]   And this was my moment.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.960]   I would burst into the meeting and make it right there and then in front of everybody
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.400]   else right at that hour.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   So I did.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.480]   I came to the side.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.520]   I threw open the door of the meeting and I burst into the room whilst they were all talking.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:25.960]   And I walked right up to my father and I said, "Father, I want my inheritance."
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:33.200]   My father, he's sitting there, holding his meeting, sees me come in, hears those words.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.080]   Everybody's eyes in the room is on him.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.160]   And he sits there and he turns and he looks out of the open door, the one that I had just
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.400]   walked in through.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.640]   And he looks out of that open door to the fields that lay just beyond them, his beloved
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.640]   fields.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.240]   And he stares at those fields for what seems like an eternity.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:03.160]   And then he turns, he looks at me and he says, "Son, if that's what you want, that is
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.160]   what you'll get."
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.480]   Did you hear that?
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.160]   He actually said, "Yes."
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:21.480]   I mean, he had no reason legally to do it, but he said, "Yes, I was elated.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.220]   I couldn't believe how easy it was.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:30.540]   In fact, the fact that it was so easy suddenly dawned on me that maybe this was a mistake.
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.680]   Maybe it was so easy because he didn't actually respect me as his son after all.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.960]   Maybe the quickness of that decision kind of made me feel less of a son.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.040]   It actually made me feel like I was just one of the hired people.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.240]   Well, if this is what he really thinks about me, that he's not willing to fight for me,
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:53.800]   well, then I'm going to take his money and I'm going to run."
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:02.420]   So a week later, I gathered up all that I had, one third of everything he had ever owned,
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:11.000]   and I took off to the farthest way away that I could possibly get, to a new city, stuffed
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.360]   with cash in my pockets to make a name for myself finally, a new land, a new place, a
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.920]   new city where I could be king for a day.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.360]   Trust me, you should have seen me in those days.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.520]   I only wish my brother had seen me.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:34.760]   I was what I think you say in your time a rock star.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.160]   I took all of that money and man, I spent it.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.080]   I brought the most lavish of clothes you could imagine.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.320]   I used that money to get into all the parties that you could get into.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.700]   I became someone in that city.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.880]   Everybody knew my name.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.340]   That money brought me success.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.640]   It brought me respect.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.880]   I began to feel just what it was like to be a little bit like my father.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:06.680]   It was glorious, glorious until something went wrong.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.960]   Now you have to understand that it wasn't my fault.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.480]   It wasn't my fault that just at the time that my money was beginning to run out, a famine
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.040]   came through the city.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.920]   Now I can tell just by looking in this room right now that none of you are actually acquainted
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.960]   with famine.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.280]   But when famine comes, it strips everything from you.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.800]   You can't even buy food.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.240]   It's literally not available.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.200]   And just at the moment when my money was running a little bit low, I suddenly found myself
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.260]   desperate and in need.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.880]   So I reached out to all these new friends that I had made, the ones that I'd gone to
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.120]   the parties with, the ones that I'd kind of brought their attention into my life.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.360]   And I went to them and I said, "Would you just help me out?
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.800]   If you give me a little bit of a loan, it would just help me to get through, get back
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   on my feet.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.480]   I'll definitely pay you back."
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.480]   Guess what?
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.200]   None of my new friends ever went into their pockets to help me out.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.360]   Couldn't you believe that?
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.760]   That no one would back me.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:12.400]   I mean, I would never turn my back on my family and my friends in a time of need.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.160]   Okay, well, anyway.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.520]   Now despite what my brother might tell you, I'm not adverse to hard work.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.160]   I mean, I got some skills.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.940]   I grew up on a farm.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.400]   So I decided the best way to get out of this situation was just to hire myself out to somebody
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.800]   to work on their farm.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.080]   So I did what every reasonable person would do.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.460]   I went to the gate of the city and I waited there to be hired by someone to go and work
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.720]   on their farm for the day.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.680]   And sure enough, this wealthy Gentile stands over and he looks at all the people in the
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680]   line.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.000]   He points at me and he says, "This one.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.120]   I want you to come with me."
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.280]   I was selected first.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.080]   That's how I am.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.080]   Elated that I would finally be able to get back on my feet.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.120]   I walked with this gentleman towards his farm.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.880]   And as we were walking, I said to him, "So what are we going to do?
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   What would you like me to do?
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.640]   How can I help out on your farm?"
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.840]   And he turns to me and he starts to laugh at me.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.040]   And he says, "You're Jewish, aren't you?"
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.920]   And I said, "Yes, yes, I am."
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.240]   And he says, "I thought so.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:24.480]   I'm going to take you and you're going to muck out my pigs."
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:31.400]   You have to understand that for a Jewish person, even touching a pig makes you defiled, makes
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.680]   you unclean, not just physically, but spiritually before our God.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:43.320]   And here was this Gentile who forces me for hours and hours to muck out the manure of
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.800]   the pigs on his farm.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:51.240]   I was covered from foot to head and all of this horrible pig manure on me.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.680]   And I realized how low I had fallen.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.680]   I realized how terrible things had actually gotten.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:05.040]   Suddenly, I began to understand that I was wretched more than perhaps anyone I had ever
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.040]   met.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.360]   I came to understand that sometimes perhaps you have to get to the very bottom before
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.000]   you can journey back up towards the top.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.080]   I had what you in your time would say is an epiphany.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.840]   For me, I came to my senses.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.600]   As I looked at myself with all of this stuff on me, looking at the pigs around me, I remembered
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.800]   the many times that father and I would actually go to the gates of our city to hire the day
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.480]   laborers for the day on our farm.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.660]   And I remember how my father would choose the day laborers.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.840]   He would always look for the one that was the most downtrodden, the most worn down,
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.560]   the most in poverty, because he knew if he chose that person, that person would work
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.240]   the hardest.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.340]   And as I remembered those many days of standing by that gate, watching my father choose the
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:06.680]   hired men, I understood that in the current context that I was in, if I was standing at
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:12.000]   the gate of my father's city, he would choose me.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.940]   I realized that I was no longer worthy to be a son of my father.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:26.880]   But I did think that if I could just get myself up and if I could just go back and if I could
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.960]   show myself to him, that he would take a look at me and he would decide that he'd be willing
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.340]   to hire me as one of his day laborers on his farm.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:42.840]   And I thought if I could just be hired by my father, I would be in a better situation
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.480]   than I am right now.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:58.960]   And with that little thread of hope, I got up and I began the long walk back home.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   Well, I guess by now you've probably met my younger brother.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:33.440]   You know, there were many months where I couldn't even bring myself to say the word brother.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:41.000]   I would say to mother and father, I would say, "That son of yours, that son of yours,"
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.260]   because he had disowned us.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.460]   He had literally divorced himself from our family.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:53.220]   He had turned his back on us, taken a third of everything we had worked hard for and just
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.220]   walked away.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.980]   I mean, could you even get your head around it?
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:03.300]   The arrogance of such an act that he'd be willing to turn his back on me, one that has
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:09.660]   walked with him almost every single day of his life, disowning me, turning his back,
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.740]   taking our money, walking away.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:16.780]   This one did not deserve anymore to have the title, "Brother."
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:25.340]   He was the son of somebody else.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.000]   My brother always was so hot-headed.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.740]   He was so immature in how he thought about everything.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:38.700]   He thought the world should revolve around him when he didn't realize that he's so blessed
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.620]   to be a part of the family that he was in.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.920]   My brother all the time was trying to communicate, try to convince me that his way of seeing
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.460]   the world was right.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.940]   I remember this one day.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:56.180]   We had heard from the servants in our household that one of our cattle had died on the far
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.780]   east field of the farm.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.260]   And so I decided I was going to go out there and take a look.
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.260]   And I looked around and I found my younger brother and I grabbed him and I dragged him
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.860]   with me on the long walk because he was so lazy.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.100]   I know that he would not gone on his own.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.580]   And we get out there and I remember it so well.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:20.260]   The sun was setting in the background and there was the dead animal and we're standing
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.700]   over this dead animal.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.700]   And you will not believe what my younger brother said.
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.220]   He goes, "You see this dead animal?
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.180]   That's just how I feel inside."
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.260]   I mean, can you believe it?
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260]   Like as if he feels dead inside.
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.940]   Are you serious?
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.860]   I said to him, "Are you crazy?
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.020]   I mean, could you not see everything around you that you have?
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.260]   Do you not see the location that you're in, the privilege that you have?
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.820]   Get a life, man."
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.580]   I think he thought that I was going to be in some solidarity with him, that I was going
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.060]   to agree with him, rebel against my father.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.580]   I would never rebel against my father.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.220]   I love my father.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.660]   Besides, if I was going to take the money and leave, who is going to actually run the
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.660]   farm?
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.660]   Would my brother run the farm?
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.300]   I don't think so.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.660]   He was the laziest kid ever.
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:17.620]   Seriously, I worked so hard just covering for his laziness.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.180]   He never pulled his weight.
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:24.620]   Any day on that farm, I would work double shifts just to cover for what he wasn't doing.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:28.540]   Did my father ever notice that I was working extra hard?
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.700]   Did my father ever stop to say, "Hey, well done, son.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.940]   I see you're covering for your brother."
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:40.280]   Did my father ever once take the time to recognize all that I was doing for him, covering and
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.500]   standing in gap for my brother?
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.500]   No, he did not.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:53.020]   In fact, I tell you this, half the time, it felt like my father favored my brother over
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.020]   me.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.820]   I mean, I'm the oldest, the eldest.
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.020]   I'm the one who should at least have a special place in the lineage of our family, in the
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:07.700]   respect of our family, but it seemed like my father always preferred my brother than
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.860]   he did me.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:17.020]   I wondered whether my father would ever stand up, would ever actually tell my brother to
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.140]   get in line, would actually ever call him out for his laziness.
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:27.420]   Would my father ever have the backbone to say something?
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:33.220]   I thought the moment arrived one day when we were gathered here at our weekly morning
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.220]   meeting.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.740]   We were sat like we always did, my father at the head of the table, me where I sat,
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:44.620]   my brother, his chair empty because he never came to this meeting.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.140]   All the hired men gathered around and we were deciding what the workload was going to be
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.820]   for that day.
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.360]   And as we're discussing what we were going to do, guess what?
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:59.200]   Suddenly the door opens up and in bursts my brother and he walks straight up to my father
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.040]   and here's the words that come out of his mouth.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:09.920]   He says, "Father, give me my inheritance."
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.040]   This was my father's moment.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.400]   This was the moment where he would finally stand up to my brother.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:22.080]   This was the moment where he would finally tell him where his place was, get him to sit
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.560]   in the chair and do a hard day's work.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.680]   This was the moment my father was finally going to have that backbone.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.480]   And I turned and I stared at him and I looked him right in the eyes and I was like, "This
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.440]   is your moment."
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.920]   You know what he did?
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:44.800]   He turned and he looked out of that door at the fields just beyond him.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.400]   And for what seemed like ages, he just stared out at his fields.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:55.080]   And then he turned around and he said to my brother, he said, "If that is what you want,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.200]   that is what you're going to get."
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.840]   He said, "Yes."
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:08.200]   He let my brother take a third of all of our property and go.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.640]   The moment where I thought he would finally stand up for himself, he gave in.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:19.640]   I literally could not believe it.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.560]   A week later, my brother took everything and went away.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.200]   I never said goodbye.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.600]   He never offered it.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.680]   And although I was so angry at what he did, it dawned on me that actually this was the
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.760]   best thing for me.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:40.440]   That with my brother now divorced from the family and gone, finally, actually my brother's
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.200]   departure was a relief to me.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.120]   For now, maybe my father would give me the attention that I always deserved.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.040]   I mean, my father didn't have two sons anymore.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.120]   He just had the one, me.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.520]   And finally now was the chance for me to repair that relationship and be back in his good
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:09.440]   books that surely now he would look upon me with favor and with hope and with love.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:16.640]   You can imagine therefore how painful it was six months later when my brother returned.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.600]   I always knew he would come back.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:24.460]   My brother could not organize a party in a vineyard, let alone try to organize his life.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.400]   And I knew that the money would run out at some point.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.080]   And when that money runs out, he's going to come back with his tail between his legs.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.360]   Sure enough, six months later, he comes back.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.600]   That didn't surprise me.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:39.520]   What surprised me was how I found out about it.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.200]   It was at the end of another long day.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:49.320]   I was in the fields as I always was, slaving away, working hard, sweat of the brow stuff.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.880]   And I was just completing my full days of work.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.500]   And I was walking back towards the farmhouse.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.680]   And you'll never believe what I heard.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.200]   Music, singing, songs, a party happening.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:08.640]   You need to understand in Jewish custom, it's the eldest son who always hosted and threw
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.800]   the parties.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.560]   It's the oldest one who would gather people, send out the invites, host them when they
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.560]   arrived.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.480]   A party happening in the household without me?
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.080]   What was going on?
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.400]   I had no idea.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.560]   So I called one of our servants to me and I said, "What's going on?
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.720]   Why is there a party happening in the farmhouse?"
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.600]   He's like, "Didn't you hear?
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.400]   Your brother's returned.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.840]   And then your father, he's killed the fatted calf.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.320]   He's thrown a party."
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:42.320]   The fatted calf, the one special animal we put aside for one time in the year when the
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.880]   harvest is brought in and we celebrate God's goodness to us.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:51.520]   That animal, my father has sacrificed for this brother.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.920]   I could not literally get my head around it.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.480]   How could my father do such a thing?
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:03.720]   My father had never even ever given me a squirmy little goat to celebrate with my friends.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.800]   And when this one, who had taken a third of all of his wealth, had gone away, squandered
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:13.440]   it, come back, and then he gets the fatted calf.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:21.400]   I stood in that field and I crossed my arms and I said in my heart, I said, "I am never
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:48.760]   standing foot in that house ever again."
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.680]   Well I guess by now you've probably met my two sons.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.360]   Quite a family I have, eh?
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.880]   If any of you are parents in this room, you might understand a little bit about what I've
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.760]   been through in the last little while.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.160]   Parenting is not easy, is it?
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:11.920]   You need to know right up front that I love my two sons completely.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:17.440]   In fact, if I'm honest with you, the reason why I have felt so much pain is because I
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.680]   love them the way I do.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:24.200]   If I didn't care about them, their actions wouldn't have any impact on me.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.840]   But my wife and I, we have always loved them.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.120]   We have given them everything.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.400]   I have worked hard all my life so that they would know the blessings of God.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.240]   They would know the fruitfulness of our labor.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:45.980]   I lavished my love upon those two boys as much as I could.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.060]   On the surface, my two sons seem quite different, don't they?
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:57.160]   My oldest son is proud and stern and diligent and works hard and, if I'm honest with you,
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.380]   is a little bit stubborn.
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:06.100]   My younger son is fancy free, opens his mouth and he puts his foot in it all the time.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.300]   He has dreams and visions.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:13.780]   He's somewhat rebellious, if I'm honest with you.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:18.160]   On the surface, they seem very different, but actually, when you get to know my sons,
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.560]   you get to understand that actually they're very, very similar deep down inside.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.560]   That actually deep down inside, both of them are struggling to find their identity, wanting
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.760]   to know who they truly are.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   Both of them think that they know what's best in life and they want to move forward in life
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.360]   in the way that they deem best.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:48.400]   Both of them are wrestling inside with a longing and a desire for belonging and acceptance.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.880]   My youngest son thinking that he can get belonging acceptance by actually getting rid of his
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.220]   responsibilities.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:26:02.120]   My oldest son thinking he can get belonging acceptance by embracing his responsibilities.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.880]   Both of them rebel against their father.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:12.340]   My youngest son in his decision to leave the household and distance himself from me.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:21.200]   My eldest son in his decision to remain in the household and distance himself from me.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   Parenting is not easy, but I wonder if you would just open your heart for a moment and
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.520]   listen to our story again.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:35.240]   I think you might hear some things that might help you in your story.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.080]   Let's start with my youngest son.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:44.600]   He was under the impression that he could get all the benefits from being my son without
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.280]   any of the relationship or responsibility that goes along with it.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.200]   This all came to a head for us one day when I was hosting my normal morning meeting with
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.640]   my eldest son, the hired man.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.960]   My youngest son was supposed to be there, but he never showed up to that meeting.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:06.280]   And as we're having the meeting like we always do, the door bursts open and in he storms
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.360]   right in front of everyone.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.880]   And he comes straight up to me and he says these words.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.320]   He says, "Father, I would like my inheritance."
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:19.000]   Could you imagine it?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.360]   His inheritance?
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:29.160]   In my frustration, I turned and I looked out of the open door that he had just walked into.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.400]   And I looked out at the fields that I could see far off in the distance.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.960]   And as I was looking out the door, listen to this.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.600]   The Holy Spirit spoke to me.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.940]   And the Holy Spirit said, "Do you see this open door in front of you?
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.000]   That open door is a prophetic sign about your heart.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.640]   Always keep your heart open towards your sons.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.860]   Never close your heart towards them."
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:04.800]   As I looked at those fields and I felt the Holy Spirit speak to me about openness always.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   It was easy then to make a decision.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:14.760]   I turned back and I looked at my son and I said, "Son, if that is your heart's desire,
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.040]   then it is my desire too."
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:24.360]   A week later, he took a third of everything that I had ever worked for and he went off
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.160]   to a foreign place.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.520]   Now I'm a smart person.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.320]   I realized that this was probably not the healthiest thing for him.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.280]   I realized that this was going to be a difficult journey.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.080]   I realized it would also be a painful, difficult journey for me too.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.400]   And day in, day out for months, I sat at this table and I prayed.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.000]   I sat at this table and I looked out of that open door.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.440]   I never shut that door.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:58.200]   And month after month, I looked out of there praying and asking that God would bring him
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.960]   home again to me.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:07.200]   As irony would have it, I was sitting here at the end of one of the days doing some accounts
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:14.160]   and I glanced out of the open door to the fields and you'll never guess what I saw.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.440]   I saw the silhouette of my son.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.320]   He was a long way away, but right then I knew it was him.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.440]   I could tell straight away that my son who was lost had returned.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.920]   My heart leapt in me.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.760]   I couldn't hold myself back.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.640]   I jumped up like a madman.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:36.680]   I grabbed the hem of my robe and I ran as fast as I could down the fields towards him.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.800]   And as I got near him, I opened my hands and I put my arms around him and squeezed him
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.320]   as much as I could.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.520]   And man, he stank.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.520]   And as I was holding him, he starts this prepared speech.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.720]   He starts to say, "Oh, Dad, I'm no longer worthy to be called your son.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.960]   I just want to be like one of your hired men."
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.640]   And I cut him off and I said, "When were you ever worthy to be my son?
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.000]   You're not my son by what you do.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.760]   You're my son because you are my son."
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.520]   I said, "You don't have to earn yourself to be my son.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.840]   You are son by birth, not by action."
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.520]   And I put my arms around him and I began to kiss his cheeks.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.560]   And I called the servants and I said, "We need to make this one right.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.280]   We need to reestablish who he is."
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.480]   And we got a robe and we put it back on him.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.800]   I took the signet ring that he had left behind.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.040]   I put it on his finger.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:34.080]   I put those sandals on his feet and he was my son.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.560]   I said to the hired hands, I said, "Look, go.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.120]   We need to kill the fatted calf.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.920]   We're going to have a party tonight because my son who was lost has returned and he is
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   here."
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.800]   And it was the greatest night of my life.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.160]   Well almost.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:31:02.640]   About halfway through the party, I realized that my eldest son was not in the room.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.720]   I said to one of our hired hands, I said, "Where is my son?"
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:13.200]   And he said, "Oh, he's still out there in the fields refusing to come in."
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:18.240]   And so for the second time that day, I went out into the fields looking for one of my
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.720]   lost sons.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.800]   As I approached him, I could see he was standing there with his arms folded.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.720]   And I walked up to him and before I could even say anything, he starts to berate me,
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.360]   shouting at me.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.240]   All of the years of frustration seemed to just be released in that moment.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.120]   I could literally see fire in his eyes.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.320]   He starts telling me how much he feels like he's a slave to me, how hard he's worked for
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.160]   me, all the things that he thinks he's done that I've never once ever stopped to appreciate
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.640]   him, that I've never given him anything.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:56.640]   And that now this son who had gone away and squandered all our wealth has come back.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:04.280]   I kill the fatted calf and my son is overwhelmed with anger and fury that I would treat him
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.480]   and his brother like this.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:14.240]   I let him just scream and shout until he's spent.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:19.360]   Then I walk forward and I put my hands on his shoulders and I look him in the eyes.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.840]   And I say, "Son, I love you.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.120]   I have always loved you.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.960]   Everything around you is yours.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.560]   Everything that I have ever done has been for you.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.640]   You want for nothing in my household.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.320]   I love you so, so much."
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:48.680]   And then I said, "But your attitude is just like your brother's.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:54.200]   He tries to lose his identity through false freedom.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:00.800]   You're trying to find your identity through false obedience."
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.560]   I said, "Both are chasing after the wind."
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:15.200]   I said, "Your brother has returned and it's right that we offer him grace."
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.920]   I told him that grace is a difficult concept to understand, that grace seems frustrating.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.720]   Grace doesn't seem to bring justice along with it, that grace seems to be against how
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.200]   we are often feeling inside.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.840]   But grace always demands a party.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:36.600]   And I challenged him whether he would consider offering the same grace that I had always
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.800]   offered him now to his brother.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   Would he come in and join me at the party and show that kind of grace to one who has
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   walked away from us but has now returned?
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.840]   Whenever I share this story, people always ask me, "Well, did he?
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.880]   Did he come into the party?"
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.640]   I never tell them.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:06.160]   And I always finish our story that way for a reason, because I think it therefore ends
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.880]   the story on an invitation from anyone who would ever hear of it.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   Here's the question, would you have joined the party?
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.640]   Think about it for a second.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.560]   Would you have gone in and embraced the brother?
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:27.920]   Would you have found yourself offering grace in such radical, beautiful ways?
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.440]   When people hear the story of my two sons, here's what they often do.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.800]   They try to find themselves in one of the sons.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.080]   "Am I the oldest son, proud and stubborn?
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.600]   Am I the young son who's rebellious and free-caring?"
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:44.440]   And let me just tell you this, you will be both sons at some point in your life.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.720]   The story is not about whether you're one of the sons.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:54.560]   The story is an invitation to whether you'll be like the father.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:00.560]   Whether you might extend grace.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:06.720]   Do not reject the things that the father accepts.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   Extend grace, for it has been extended to you.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:20.240]   That's the beauty of the pain and the journey and the redemption I have been through with
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.600]   my family.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:29.560]   And as you hear our story, my prayer and my hope is that you'd find your story in it.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:35.000]   That the Holy Spirit might challenge you also, like he did for me that day, to never close
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   my heart to the ones that the father has already accepted.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.960]   Are you someone of grace?
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:53.000]   Or have you distanced yourself again before the father?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.480]   That's the story of the prodigal son from Luke chapter 15.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.240]   I wonder whether we could pray together.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:07.800]   Should we pray?
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.280]   I'm going to pray as Andrew Gardner, by the way, just so you know.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.200]   Father we pray.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.680]   We come before you in this beautiful, sacred moment, off the back of this beautiful, sacred
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   story.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.720]   A story told to you something thousand years ago, retold today, still with relevance for
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.800]   us.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:33.380]   Like Susanna shared during our worship time, you are putting all of us back together.
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:38.140]   You lavish us with your love and your desire for us.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:44.040]   You forgive us, restore us, no matter how rebellious we've been.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.400]   And Lord, there are people in this room that can identify with the prodigal son, knowing
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.400]   that they've run a long way away.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:57.360]   But here today, hearing afresh, you running in the fields towards them, never having closed
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.440]   your heart to them.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.580]   Father, there are some in this room that would identify with the older son, perhaps been
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:09.480]   Christians all their lives, but struggled with their relationship with you, that they've
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.440]   distanced themselves sometimes, maybe thinking that they're not getting the blessings that
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.440]   they deserve.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:20.520]   But Father, I believe you're calling all of us in this room today to identify with the
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:28.560]   Father, to see the Father true and well, to recognize that we have been forgiven and offered
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:36.080]   great grace, radical grace, unrelenting grace, grace that we do not deserve, but grace that
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.280]   has been given.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.400]   And in the giving of that grace, we have a choice.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.960]   Will we join the grace party?
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:52.320]   Or will we reject the things that the Father accepts?
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.280]   And as you sit in the beauty of this story again, can I encourage you just to bring that
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.120]   thought before Jesus now.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.880]   Would you have gone into the party?
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:08.640]   Are you someone who walks in a profound realization of the grace on you and then is willing to
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.400]   offer that grace again and again and again to those that perhaps you don't even think
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.320]   deserve it?
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:24.560]   I believe those with a different spirit in our city in this time are those who offer
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.680]   radical grace.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:32.240]   Take your time just to soak on that thought, on this story, as our worship team comes and
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.640]   just leads us in response.
