1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
 - Thank you Carla for just being amazing as always.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,720
 So good.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,720
 Well, welcome to The Vine.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,280
 My name's Andrew, one of the pastors here,

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,920
 and there's probably a lot of you

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,560
 that are visiting with us this weekend,

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,480
 and we are so, so glad that you are with us and amongst us.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,320
 And I know there's loads of people

9
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,480
 in the overflow right now,

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
 so I wanted to say hi to everybody in the overflow.

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,720
 Thank you guys for being willing to sit in the overflow,

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,280
 and then everybody that's sitting on the floor

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,120
 and everything crazy.

14
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,360
 Anyway, we're so glad you guys are here.

15
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,560
 A number of years ago,

16
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,040
 I was invited to speak at a church overseas,

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,960
 and this happens a number of times for me,

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,280
 and it's always a great privilege to travel overseas,

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,120
 to speak in other churches and other contexts.

20
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,480
 But every time I get invited to speak overseas,

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,840
 I know that I, as well as being excited,

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,160
 I know that I'm also gonna be exhausted,

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,880
 because these trips are like full on.

24
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,920
 From the moment that the pastor from that church

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,360
 picks you up at the airport,

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,440
 to the moment that they drop you back at the airport,

27
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,480
 like three days later, you are on 24/7.

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,120
 It is crazy.

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,400
 They expect you not just to speak in their church,

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,040
 but they expect you to sort of pastor all their people,

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,480
 pray for everybody, solve all the problems of the church,

32
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,320
 work out why their finances are not right,

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,520
 visit with their eldership,

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,800
 and solve all the problems there,

35
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,400
 and strategically believe for everything.

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,680
 You're supposed to have a prophetic word

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,280
 for every single person in the church.

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,600
 The whole thing is crazy, and it is a great privilege.

39
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,200
 Honestly, one of the great privileges to go there.

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,480
 I love what I do, and when I get invited to go do that,

41
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,920
 I'm very excited about it,

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,000
 but I recognize that I have to manage my energy.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,600
 If I don't manage my energy,

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
 I know that about a day and a half into the trip,

45
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,440
 I will hate everybody in that church.

46
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,200
 I will be exhausted.

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,840
 Anyone here not like people when you're tired?

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,920
 You know when you get tired, right?

49
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,280
 You get a little prickly with people.

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,040
 And I realize that I'm going overseas to this church,

51
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,640
 I'm representing the vine, right?

52
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,400
 I don't wanna be that guy like two days in

53
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,440
 who really doesn't like the people around them,

54
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,840
 and is getting a little prickly with people.

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,680
 So I have to like make sure that my energy

56
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,440
 is well managed on these trips.

57
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,760
 Well, on this particular trip I went to,

58
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,520
 the church was larger than the vine.

59
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,360
 They had five services on a Sunday.

60
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,240
 I was speaking at all five services,

61
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,040
 pretty much back to back.

62
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,040
 After the third service, I was tired.

63
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,040
 After the fourth service, I was a little bit wobbly.

64
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,480
 After the fifth service, I couldn't even remember my name.

65
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,400
 Okay, I was really exhausted.

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,760
 And of course it was after every service,

67
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,320
 they expected me to be on the prayer line.

68
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,200
 So I'd go down the front, I'd be on the prayer line.

69
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,960
 And it was after the fifth service,

70
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,560
 I'm on the prayer line after I've just preached,

71
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,520
 there's a crowd of people that are waiting

72
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,480
 to get prayed for me, that the most awkward thing

73
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,280
 that perhaps has ever happened to me, happens.

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,600
 There was this guy on the prayer line,

75
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,560
 waiting for me to pray with him.

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,920
 He comes forward and as usual with these sort of things,

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,720
 you know, we introduce ourselves and stuff.

78
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,280
 And I say to him, the thing that I say to pretty much

79
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
 everybody when I'm ever on a prayer line,

80
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,520
 I say to him, what is it that you would like me

81
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
 to pray for you for today?

82
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,160
 You know, what is it that I can pray for you about?

83
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,720
 This was his response.

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
 He said this, "You're a man of God.

85
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,240
 "I don't need to tell you what my needs are.

86
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,680
 "God knows, just ask God and he will tell you.

87
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,840
 "I wanna see what you will say."

88
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,840
 (congregation laughing)

89
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,000
 Five services, okay, I'm exhausted.

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,040
 And I don't like people at this point, all right?

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,600
 And here's this guy, and I tell you what,

92
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,080
 this happens more than you might think,

93
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,360
 more than you expect.

94
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,040
 This guy comes up to me, he's basically like,

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,800
 "I wanna see whether you're really a pastor.

96
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,400
 "I wanna see if you really hear from God, okay?

97
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,200
 "I know what my needs are, God knows, but do you know?

98
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,080
 "Ha ha ha ha, you're gonna have to pray about it.

99
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,880
 "And when you pray about it, we'll find out

100
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,720
 "if you hear from the Spirit of God."

101
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,960
 (congregation laughing)

102
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,840
 By the way, if you're taking notes, write this down.

103
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,640
 Us pastors do not like people like this, okay?

104
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,400
 This feels like you're put under a spiritual test.

105
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,320
 It feels like they're testing you

106
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,640
 to see whether you're truly a person of the Spirit.

107
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,480
 And so this guy is speaking like this.

108
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,360
 By the way, this is on the same part

109
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,040
 as the other pet peeve that us pastors have,

110
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,880
 and that's this, "Pastor, you prayed for me seven years ago

111
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,600
 "and I've never seen you ever since.

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,400
 "Do you remember what you prayed for?"

113
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,360
 (congregation laughing)

114
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,080
 Here's the answer, "No, we don't remember.

115
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,000
 "We're like vessels, the Spirit comes in

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,680
 "and out of us, we are not spiritual data cards

117
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,240
 "that are storing everybody's spiritual issues.

118
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,200
 "For decades, that doesn't happen."

119
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,640
 Okay, anyway.

120
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,560
 So this guy is like testing me.

121
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,880
 I'm, my attitude, like I am using all the remaining reserves

122
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,880
 of energy that I have to try to be calm

123
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,240
 and nice and polite to this guy.

124
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,240
 So I said, "Okay, yeah, sure, let's pray."

125
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,600
 So I put my hand on his shoulder, we start to pray.

126
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,120
 And I say to God, "God, you know I'm tired.

127
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,600
 "And you know my attitude really is not good right now.

128
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,280
 "But I come to you and if you have something

129
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,280
 "you wanna say to this guy, speak to me

130
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,680
 "and I'll pray over him."

131
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,520
 Well, as God often does with me,

132
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,760
 he gave me a visual, a visual something.

133
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,880
 I often see things when I'm praying for people

134
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,160
 and I saw something.

135
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,480
 And I begin to pray this over this guy.

136
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,840
 About a minute into praying it,

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I realized that what I'm praying is not very positive.

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,320
 It's not very sort of happy.

139
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,880
 It's actually kind of a hard thing

140
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,840
 that I was praying for him about.

141
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,040
 And I kept praying and I kind of lent in

142
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,800
 to what I sensed God was saying.

143
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,640
 And as I prayed on, I could tell that the prayer

144
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,720
 was just a little bit heavy.

145
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,520
 It was a little bit, it wasn't mean,

146
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,640
 but it was just like the things that I felt

147
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,480
 like God was saying to him

148
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,200
 were not necessarily easy things to hear.

149
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,520
 And at the end of the prayer, I said, "Amen."

150
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,480
 And I opened my eyes and I was met with this face.

151
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,320
 (congregation laughing)

152
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,200
 And the guy says these words to me, he goes,

153
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,160
 "Uh, okay, thank you."

154
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,080
 And then he just walks off.

155
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,920
 And I'm left there like,

156
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,800
 "That is the most awkward experience I have ever had."

157
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,520
 Well, six months later, I get an email.

158
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,520
 And the email is from this guy.

159
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,000
 And he's managed to track down my email.

160
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And in the opening line of the email,

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,120
 I wonder if you can imagine what it said.

162
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,600
 It said this, "Pastor, you prayed for me six months ago.

163
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,120
 "I wonder if you remember what you prayed for me about."

164
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,720
 (congregation laughing)

165
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,640
 The irony is in this case,

166
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,000
 I did actually remember what I prayed for this guy about,

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,480
 'cause it wasn't very nice, right?

168
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,400
 And he starts to tell me in this email, he's like,

169
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,640
 "You know, you prayed for me and you said these things.

170
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,320
 "And I was actually really offended in the moment.

171
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,040
 "And I didn't like what you said.

172
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,480
 "And I walked away and out of the church that day.

173
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,640
 "And I was angry.

174
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,720
 "I was angry at you.

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,040
 "I was angry at God."

176
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,160
 And anyway, this was not a pleasant email

177
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,000
 up to this point, right?

178
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,120
 And I was like, "Okay, great."

179
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,280
 And then he said, "But God kept speaking to me

180
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,720
 "about those words that you said over the coming weeks.

181
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,440
 "And I kept having to bring myself back to prayer

182
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,640
 "with those words.

183
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,000
 "And I realized that those words

184
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,640
 "that God was saying to me on that day

185
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,760
 "were designed to uproot

186
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,520
 "some of the deepest stuff that was in my life."

187
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,160
 And he went on to tell me some of the deep sins

188
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,720
 and the brokenness, addictions,

189
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,160
 and some things that he had in his life.

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,400
 And as the email went on, he said,

191
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,760
 "You know, I was able, it took me about six months,

192
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,240
 "but I've been able to reach out to my wife."

193
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
 It turned out that him and his wife

194
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
 had been separated for some time.

195
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,840
 And he reached out to his wife and he repented with her

196
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
 and apologized for some things.

197
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,240
 And he said, "We've gotten back together

198
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,080
 "and we're trying to make marriage work again.

199
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,920
 "And I just wanted to let you know

200
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,200
 "that although I treated you rudely in the moment,

201
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,200
 "that those things that you said disrupted stuff."

202
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,560
 He goes, he actually said this, he said,

203
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,560
 "I didn't wanna hear what you said,

204
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,320
 "but it disrupted some things in me

205
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,360
 "that needed to get disrupted."

206
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,400
 And he said, "I just want you to know

207
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,120
 "that I'm in a better place now."

208
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,040
 I wonder if you've ever experienced God

209
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,800
 saying something to you that is not easy for you to hear,

210
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,400
 that is not comfortable to hear.

211
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,200
 I wonder if any of us have ever experienced

212
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
 when God speaks to us in a way that kind of,

213
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,320
 just comes in and disrupts some things in us.

214
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,200
 It's not easy, is it?

215
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,160
 I think as Christians, we often think

216
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,960
 that when God speaks to his people,

217
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,760
 he's always gonna speak super positive things.

218
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,200
 That when God speaks to his people,

219
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,680
 it's always gonna be kind of a feel good thing.

220
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,080
 It's always gonna make me feel good.

221
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,040
 It's always gonna be great.

222
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,880
 It's always gonna be wonderful.

223
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
 And I think us Christians get so conditioned

224
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,920
 into thinking that that's always how God speaks,

225
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,520
 that when God shows up and says something

226
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,640
 that's slightly different to what we expected,

227
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,080
 or says something that we weren't quite

228
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,560
 kind of wanting to hear or whatever it might be,

229
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,920
 we often, as Christians, I think, reject that.

230
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,720
 We think, "Oh, that's probably not God.

231
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,640
 "That can't be God.

232
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,000
 "God wouldn't say something like that."

233
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,280
 And we kind of push away from it.

234
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,120
 And I think we have this problem as Christians sometimes,

235
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,840
 'cause we're always expecting God to show up a certain way,

236
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,320
 but when he shows up in a different way,

237
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,360
 we really struggle with that.

238
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,960
 Am I the only person here who struggles with that?

239
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,560
 I am, I guess, the only person here who struggles with that.

240
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,640
 I'm assuming that more of you also do.

241
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,720
 Here's the reality that I think

242
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,440
 I've come to learn about God,

243
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,120
 that I think is actually a very important thing

244
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,520
 for us to grasp, and it's this,

245
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,120
 that sometimes when God speaks,

246
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,440
 the very thing you need to hear the most

247
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,760
 is often the very thing you want to hear the least.

248
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,560
 Come on, church.

249
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,000
 So often when God speaks to us,

250
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
 the very thing we need to hear the most

251
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,840
 is often the very thing we want to hear the least.

252
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,400
 That actually is a really good summary

253
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,240
 of the first Christmas that happened some 2,000 years ago.

254
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,520
 See, when Matthew and Luke present the birth story of Jesus,

255
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,440
 they present it in a raw and very real way.

256
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,840
 And yes, it's a story of incredible moments,

257
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,200
 a story of choirs of angels and God's birth,

258
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,720
 the incarnation and the glory and the peace

259
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
 that is exclaimed during that time.

260
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,120
 But if the story of Jesus' birth is anything,

261
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,520
 it's a story of a God who speaks

262
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,000
 and a God who longs to speak to his people.

263
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,240
 But if you trace through the story,

264
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,160
 you'll see very quickly that so often the things

265
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,960
 that God speaks to the characters in the Christmas story

266
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,920
 is not the things that they were expecting to hear.

267
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,560
 It's not the things that they even perhaps wanted to hear.

268
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,600
 Take Zachariah, for example.

269
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,640
 God shows up in an angel through Gabriel and says to him,

270
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,320
 "Hey, because of your unfaithfulness,

271
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,760
 "you're now not gonna be able to talk

272
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,320
 "until your wife Elizabeth gives birth."

273
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,360
 Take Joseph, for example.

274
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,560
 Joseph, having discovered that his unmarried,

275
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,320
 pregnant fiancee is now pregnant with a child

276
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,120
 that came from the Holy Spirit,

277
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,680
 and he understands the shame that will come upon him

278
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,920
 and upon Mary, and so he's making plans in his mind

279
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,880
 to do the right thing for her and for him,

280
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,400
 and which is to separate their relationship.

281
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,440
 And God steps in and says,

282
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,280
 "No, you can't separate that relationship.

283
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,640
 "You're actually gonna have to walk into that shame,

284
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,120
 "walk into that pain, 'cause I've got a bigger thing

285
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,320
 "that's happening here."

286
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,000
 Or think about the shepherds.

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,280
 The shepherds who were faithfully looking after their sheep,

288
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,920
 which was their livelihood.

289
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,320
 God shows up in the form of angels and says,

290
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,240
 "Leave your livelihood behind and go into Bethlehem.

291
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,120
 "Just drop everything that you've worked hard for,

292
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,760
 "because we've got a new thing

293
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,080
 "that we want to happen in your life."

294
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,120
 Isn't it so interesting for us that we have a plan A

295
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,480
 that we think is our plan A,

296
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,760
 but so often God comes and says,

297
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,000
 "There's actually a B, C, and a D

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,920
 "that is really the thing that's gonna set you alight,

299
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,560
 "really the thing that's gonna make you as a person,

300
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,640
 "really the thing that's gonna flourish you

301
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,760
 "and bring you into the fullness of who you are."

302
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,560
 I mean, just think about Mary.

303
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,920
 God shows up to Mary and says some pretty crazy things,

304
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,840
 things that she must've been so confused by,

305
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,280
 so overwhelmed by,

306
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,560
 not things that she was expecting God to say to her.

307
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,360
 In fact, I think if Mary had the choice,

308
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,240
 she would have chosen not to be in a part

309
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,800
 of the whole Christmas story in the first place.

310
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,440
 Imagine the shame that she had to hold.

311
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,880
 Imagine the months that she had to go through,

312
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,360
 where people thought all this stuff about her.

313
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,040
 If she had the choice, she probably would have said,

314
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,520
 "I didn't even wanna go anywhere near that story

315
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,280
 "or that thing whatsoever."

316
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,000
 And I think this is fascinating,

317
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,400
 that in the heart of the Christmas story,

318
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,440
 you see something that is so important

319
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,200
 for all of us to understand about how God works in our lives.

320
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,640
 And it's this, that your personal preferences

321
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,840
 and your personal choice is not always

322
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,000
 the most important things in God's mind

323
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,240
 when it comes to his leadership of your life.

324
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,680
 I know this is not the Christmas message

325
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,920
 you were hoping to hear.

326
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,600
 (congregation laughing)

327
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
 But I wanna encourage you to stay in with me

328
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,200
 because I think there's something important

329
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
 that you need to hear.

330
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,440
 Our personal choices and our personal preferences

331
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,440
 are not always God's most forefront things in his mind.

332
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,080
 When he thinks about you and his leadership of his life,

333
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,520
 and he sees you, he sees your future,

334
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,840
 he sees where he's leading you in his life.

335
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,480
 And he says, "I know what's ahead.

336
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,640
 "And I know all the good things.

337
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
 "I know the bad things.

338
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,680
 "I know the ugly things.

339
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,560
 "And you want plan A,

340
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,720
 "but I've got this other plan over here."

341
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,320
 Your personal preference is to go down this path.

342
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,480
 But if you go down that path,

343
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,040
 I tell you in five years time,

344
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,200
 you're gonna hit rock bottom.

345
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,920
 But if you were to listen to me,

346
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,240
 if you were just to come with me,

347
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,320
 I've got a new path that I'm gonna take you down.

348
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,600
 And this is the way that will bring flourishing

349
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,160
 and growth and life to you.

350
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
 Your personal choices and preferences,

351
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,200
 they're important to God,

352
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,280
 but they're not the most important thing to him.

353
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,240
 He sees stuff that you will never see.

354
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,160
 And in faithfulness and trust,

355
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,720
 we are to turn to his word.

356
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,360
 Are you following this?

357
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:38,280
 But sometimes the word that God brings is challenging.

358
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,840
 It's hard to hear.

359
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,520
 And it comes and disrupts some things in us.

360
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,520
 Case in point is exactly what happens

361
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,560
 at the end of the Christmas story.

362
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,400
 The story that Luke is presenting to us

363
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,280
 of the birth of Jesus,

364
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,560
 he adds a very important story right at the end.

365
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,840
 It's almost like an epilogue to the story, if you will.

366
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
 It's the moment where Mary and Joseph,

367
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,280
 having had the child Jesus,

368
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,080
 Jesus is now eight days old.

369
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,520
 And from Bethlehem to Jerusalem,

370
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,960
 they make the journey from Bethlehem to Jerusalem,

371
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,560
 and they go into the temple when Jesus is eight days old.

372
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,520
 And they're carrying him in

373
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,080
 because the ritual at the time,

374
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,560
 the tradition at the time,

375
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,240
 was that faithful Jewish families

376
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,640
 would take their firstborn son

377
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,480
 and bring him into the temple to be dedicated to the Lord.

378
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,000
 And that dedication ceremony

379
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,560
 involved the act of circumcision.

380
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,880
 And so this was what Mary and Joseph were doing.

381
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,800
 They're faithful Jewish people going to the temple

382
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,240
 on the eighth day with Jesus,

383
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
 taking him into the temple

384
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,880
 in order for him to be dedicated

385
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,800
 and for the circumcision ceremony to take place.

386
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,480
 And when they're in the house of God,

387
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,840
 something awkward happens.

388
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,920
 A little bit like me standing in that prayer line

389
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,720
 and that man coming forward.

390
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,520
 For Mary and Joseph,

391
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,880
 something significantly awkward takes place.

392
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,160
 Let me actually break this down for you

393
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,200
 from Luke chapter two, starting in verse 25.

394
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,680
 Everybody still okay?

395
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
 Do you still like me?

396
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,600
 I'm really, if you're visiting,

397
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
 I'm really a nice person.

398
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,920
 Trust me, I am, I am.

399
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,280
 But hang with us.

400
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,520
 Verse 25 of chapter two of the Christmas story.

401
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,640
 Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon

402
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,320
 who was righteous and devout.

403
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,480
 He was waiting for the consolation of Israel

404
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,360
 and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

405
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,040
 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit

406
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,760
 that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

407
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,320
 That's the Messiah.

408
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,480
 Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts

409
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,440
 when the parents, that's Mary and Joseph,

410
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,600
 brought in the child Jesus to do for him

411
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,080
 what was custom of the Lord, that the law required,

412
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
 that's the circumcision.

413
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,600
 Simeon took the baby into his arms

414
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,080
 and praised God saying this,

415
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,160
 "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,

416
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,360
 "now dismiss your servant in peace.

417
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
 "For my eyes have seen your salvation,

418
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,960
 "which you have prepared in the sight of all people,

419
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,040
 "a light for revelation to the Gentiles

420
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,680
 "and for glory to your people Israel."

421
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,120
 Up until this point in the story,

422
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,200
 everything is going perfectly right.

423
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,080
 This is wonderful.

424
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,360
 And Luke is creating and writing this story

425
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,680
 to help you to see how amazing this is.

426
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,720
 There's the temple in all of its glory and beauty

427
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,760
 in the presence of God.

428
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,480
 For the very first time, the Son of God

429
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,720
 is being brought into the temple itself.

430
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,280
 There's Mary and Joseph, the faithful family

431
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,760
 bringing their child for that dedication service

432
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,160
 and then we're introduced to the sort of creme de la creme,

433
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,480
 Simeon.

434
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,720
 And Simeon is described by Luke in the best ways

435
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,400
 that you could ever hope to be described in the Bible.

436
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,520
 Listen to this, righteous and devout,

437
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,800
 waiting for the consolation of Israel,

438
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,360
 the Holy Spirit upon him.

439
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,960
 Luke is saying, this man is righteous.

440
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,400
 He hasn't put a foot wrong.

441
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,960
 This man loves the Lord.

442
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,520
 He's devout in his devotion to God.

443
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,560
 He is waiting for the Messiah to come.

444
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,680
 He's so excited that one day God would step into the world

445
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,520
 with the Messiah.

446
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,800
 Not only that, but he's filled with the Holy Spirit.

447
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,280
 I mean, you can't paint somebody in a better light than that.

448
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,680
 Righteous, devout, waiting for God,

449
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,400
 filled with the Holy Spirit.

450
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,040
 And the Holy Spirit takes Simeon

451
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,600
 and he walks into the temple courts

452
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,280
 and he sees the baby Jesus

453
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,240
 and he sweeps up Jesus in his arms.

454
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,760
 And notice what he says.

455
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,240
 He says, "This is a light for revelation to the Gentiles

456
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,880
 "and glory to your people, Israel."

457
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,000
 You could not say a better thing about baby Jesus,

458
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,440
 that he's gonna be the light of revelation to the Gentiles.

459
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,560
 I love that the Christmas story brings us the picture

460
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,120
 of Jesus's mission to the world.

461
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,920
 That anyone who was not Jewish,

462
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,000
 that's the majority of us in this room,

463
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,840
 we can come to the saving knowledge of God

464
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,080
 through Jesus Christ.

465
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,640
 He's a light of revelation to all of us here in Hong Kong.

466
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,080
 But he's also the glory to Israel.

467
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,520
 He's also gonna do all the things

468
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,880
 that the scriptures had prophesied

469
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,640
 about what was gonna happen to Israel.

470
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,440
 He was gonna be their Messiah and their Christ.

471
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,680
 And Simeon sweeps up baby Jesus in his arms

472
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,480
 and says all these incredible stuff.

473
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,160
 And you can imagine Joseph and Mary standing there

474
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,440
 and thinking, "This is the most amazing thing

475
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,520
 "I have ever heard.

476
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,640
 "This is the best thing I could ever hear about my child."

477
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,840
 I mean, think about this from your perspective.

478
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,920
 Imagine if you had a baby

479
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,000
 and you come into the vine on a Sunday,

480
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,080
 it would be like one of the pastors from the vine

481
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,360
 sweeping up your child in their arms

482
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,120
 and going, "This one, this one is destined to go to Harvard

483
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,240
 "and graduate from the top of his class.

484
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,760
 "This one will be a millionaire by the age of 30,

485
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,680
 "for he will become a doctor or a lawyer or a banker.

486
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,520
 "This one will master the piano and the violin

487
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,160
 "and will speak 13 languages.

488
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,320
 "And even in your old age, you will be blessed

489
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,040
 "'cause this one will look after you."

490
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,880
 Every Hong Kong family would say, "Praise the Lord.

491
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,760
 "Are you with me?"

492
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,440
 That's what it was like for Mary and Joseph, okay?

493
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,640
 This was their Harvard monument, all right?

494
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,240
 The child will be a light of revelation to Gentiles.

495
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,120
 He's going to be the glory to Israel.

496
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,600
 It could not get better than this,

497
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,720
 which is why it says in the next verse,

498
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,280
 it says, "The child's father and mother marveled

499
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,400
 "at what was said about him."

500
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
 The word marveled there means they rejoiced.

501
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,120
 They were in wonder, they were in awe.

502
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,680
 This was the most amazing thing they have ever heard.

503
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,280
 And right now, Luke is basically saying,

504
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,960
 "It can't get better.

505
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,400
 "Isn't God great?

506
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,400
 "Isn't he saying nice things?"

507
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,880
 And then Simeon opens his mouth again.

508
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,440
 And then he puts Jesus to one side and he turns to Mary.

509
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,640
 And I want you to hear what he says to Mary.

510
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,400
 "Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother,

511
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,800
 "'This child is destined to cause the falling

512
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,200
 "'and the rising of many in Israel

513
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,960
 "'and to be a sign that will be spoken against,

514
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,000
 "'so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed

515
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,880
 "'and a sword will pierce your own soul too.'"

516
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,320
 This was not in the Christmas script

517
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,560
 that was supposed to be the Christmas script.

518
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,520
 This wasn't quite as nice

519
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,080
 as what had just been spoken about Jesus.

520
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,360
 Simeon turns to Mary and he says some prophetic words

521
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,200
 over her that she did not want to hear,

522
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,520
 but she needed to hear.

523
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,880
 He says to her, first of all,

524
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,280
 that Jesus is gonna be an absolute nightmare for you.

525
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,400
 He said, "He's gonna cause the rising and the falling

526
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,800
 "of many in Israel and will be a sign

527
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,400
 "that will be spoken against."

528
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,360
 In other words, Jesus is gonna grow up

529
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,520
 and he's gonna be a controversial figure,

530
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,040
 he's saying to Mary.

531
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,080
 He's gonna cause the falling and the rising

532
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,000
 that the contents of people's hearts

533
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,840
 are gonna be revealed

534
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,440
 and no one likes the contents of their heart to be revealed.

535
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,480
 And some people will rise with Jesus.

536
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,880
 So some people will find their greatest life

537
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
 in relationship with him,

538
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,720
 but there are others who will reject him,

539
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,160
 who will not believe him,

540
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,560
 who will turn their backs on him,

541
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,760
 others who will actually speak against him.

542
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,480
 And this Jesus, he's gonna say some things.

543
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,720
 I mean, he's gonna come and he's gonna say some things

544
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,800
 that you, Mary, as his mother,

545
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,640
 you're gonna be like, "Oh my goodness, I can't believe

546
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,720
 "he just said that."

547
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,760
 This is not gonna be an easy future for you, Mary.

548
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,560
 And God so loves Mary in this moment.

549
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,800
 So, I want you to see this,

550
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,880
 so loves Mary, but sees her future

551
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,520
 and knows it's gonna be hard,

552
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,400
 knows that raising the son of God is not gonna be easy.

553
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,200
 And so out of his love for her,

554
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,720
 he wants to prepare her and mold her and shape her

555
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,960
 into the woman that she needs to become

556
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,600
 so that she can be the mother to the son of God.

557
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,360
 And so he brings a word that she may not want to have heard,

558
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,800
 but she needed to hear in order to become the woman

559
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,040
 God wanted her to become.

560
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,560
 I mean, Jesus, can you imagine what Jesus is about to do?

561
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,080
 He's about to say things like,

562
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,640
 "Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood,

563
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,040
 "you have no part of my kingdom."

564
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,200
 That one got most of his followers to leave him.

565
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,960
 He would say to the religious authorities of the day,

566
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,480
 "You brood of vipers, you whitewashed tombs."

567
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,320
 He would say to his disciples, the followers,

568
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,880
 he would say, "Unless you pick up your cross,

569
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,840
 "unless you die, basically, you can't follow me."

570
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,240
 He would actually say to his best friend,

571
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,560
 he would call his best friend Satan.

572
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,920
 This is not how to win friends and influence people.

573
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,760
 And then Simeon says this.

574
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,240
 He says, "A sword will pierce your own soul too."

575
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,720
 He's not speaking, of course, of a literal sword.

576
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,040
 He's not speaking of her death in the future.

577
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,000
 He's speaking about her emotions.

578
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,320
 He's speaking about how hard it's going to be for her.

579
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,800
 And that if she's not prepared for the reality

580
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 of the chance and the choices and the things,

581
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,080
 there's one point Jesus is going to,

582
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,240
 in front of his mother, say,

583
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,720
 "My mother and father is not biological.

584
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,040
 "My mother and father is anyone

585
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,560
 "who follows after my father."

586
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,280
 Mary is gonna have a hard path,

587
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,280
 and God doesn't hold back from helping her to see

588
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,120
 that there's some tough times ahead.

589
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,480
 There's a sword that's gonna feel like it pierces your soul.

590
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,560
 It's gonna be difficult.

591
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,080
 And God is saying this because he's like,

592
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,840
 "I love you so much that I'm gonna say the very things

593
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,880
 "to you that you need to hear,

594
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,840
 "even as you're holding an eight-day-old child

595
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,040
 "in your hands, the future ahead for him.

596
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,520
 "He is gonna be the savior of the world.

597
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,800
 "He is the light of revelation to the Gentiles.

598
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,360
 "He is the glory to Israel.

599
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,680
 "You are gonna have the joy of holding him,

600
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,640
 "but you're also gonna feel the pain

601
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,720
 "that no parent wants to feel,

602
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,880
 "and that is you're gonna watch your child die."

603
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,480
 And God has so much love for Mary

604
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,600
 that he's willing to speak a hard word.

605
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,600
 God has so much love for you,

606
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,000
 and God sees everything that is ahead of you.

607
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,080
 God loves you so much that he's also willing, at times,

608
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,400
 to come and speak over you

609
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,960
 and to help, perhaps, you to see that there are some things

610
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,560
 that might need to change in your life,

611
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,840
 or perhaps tell you that there are some things coming up

612
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,320
 that you need to get ready for and prepare for,

613
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,360
 'cause if you're not, it's gonna be overwhelming,

614
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,280
 and it will feel like a sword has pierced your soul, too.

615
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,440
 I think sometimes, as Christians,

616
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,160
 we think that when we come to Christ Jesus,

617
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,560
 then everything's gonna be absolutely perfect.

618
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,440
 The Christmas story shows us a different thing.

619
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,280
 And of course, Jesus is our life.

620
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,320
 And the wonderful thing that we celebrate at Christmastime

621
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,600
 is the arrival of our Savior and our Messiah,

622
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,000
 that when we're in relationship with him,

623
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,560
 our sin is taken care of, forgiven.

624
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,960
 We're released and filled with the fullness of God,

625
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,440
 that the same Spirit that raised Jesus is found in us,

626
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,400
 and that we are found into flourishing, fullness of life,

627
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,680
 that we can know the fullness of peace, shalom,

628
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,440
 and that we'll have eternal life with him.

629
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,960
 There is so much good news in the gospel, so much there,

630
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,960
 and God so wants all of that for you

631
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,880
 that he's sometimes willing to speak something

632
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,000
 that is not gonna be easy for you to hear

633
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,960
 to ensure that you remain on the path

634
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,400
 that he has for you to be on.

635
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:57,800
 See, Jesus is not afraid to speak a disruptive word

636
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,640
 to your perfect world if your perfect world

637
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,800
 is perfectly misaligned to his perfect will.

638
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,480
 He's not afraid to do that.

639
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,720
 And it seems weird, doesn't it, on Christmas Eve

640
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,960
 that this would be a part of the Christmas story,

641
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,880
 but I think it's a part of the Christmas story

642
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,560
 because God is revealing his heart to his people.

643
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,360
 I'm so passionately in love with you,

644
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,400
 and I so passionately want the best for you,

645
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,760
 that if there is anything in your life that is misaligned,

646
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,400
 I have the grace and the courage

647
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,200
 to lead you on a different path.

648
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,440
 I don't know about you, but I've had the disruptive word

649
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,720
 of God into my life many times over my life.

650
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,760
 I remember when I first quit my job,

651
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,800
 I was in banking here.

652
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,560
 I was one of those kids that was the banker.

653
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,960
 I wasn't a millionaire by 30, but I was a banker.

654
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,440
 And I felt God calling me out of that marketplace world

655
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,800
 into being a pastor, and so I remember quitting my job

656
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,880
 and moving with my family to New Zealand

657
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,680
 to go to Bible school, and I remember the first month

658
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,560
 in Bible school, I felt so excited.

659
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,600
 I felt so excited about what my future was.

660
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,640
 I could not wait to become a pastor.

661
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
 Could not wait to become a preacher.

662
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,040
 I knew that God had called me to preach,

663
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,160
 and I was really excited to have a life

664
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,560
 where I could communicate God's word to people

665
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,400
 and speak life over people.

666
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,440
 I mean, it was everything I wanted to do,

667
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
 and I remember in the first month of Bible school,

668
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,080
 I was setting myself ready for all the studies.

669
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,120
 I wanted to learn Greek.

670
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,040
 I wanted to learn Hebrew.

671
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
 I wanted to understand the Bible as best I could

672
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,480
 because I wanted to be the best preacher

673
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,840
 of God's word that I could,

674
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,920
 and in the first month, I said to God,

675
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,960
 I said, "God, would you speak to me a word

676
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,520
 "about my preaching gift?"

677
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,400
 And I was expecting that God would say,

678
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,680
 "You're awesome, Andrew.

679
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,280
 "You're the best ever.

680
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,120
 "You're the best.

681
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,640
 "I can't wait to see your future.

682
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,560
 "You're gonna be the city pastor

683
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,880
 "of a church called The Vine in Hong Kong,

684
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,840
 "and it's gonna be amazing,

685
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,480
 "and there's gonna be so many people on Christmas Eve

686
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,320
 "that not only are you gonna be able to fit

687
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,440
 "into the building, and it's gonna be great."

688
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,560
 (congregation laughing)

689
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,560
 I was expecting a word along those kind of lines.

690
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,000
 But God said to me,

691
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,040
 "You really want me to speak to you

692
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,640
 "about your preaching gift?"

693
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,320
 I was like, "Yeah."

694
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,360
 He's like, "Go to Amos chapter eight."

695
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,680
 So I went to Amos chapter eight, and here's what I read.

696
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,880
 "The days are coming, declares the sovereign Lord,

697
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,000
 "when I will send a famine through the land,

698
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,520
 "not a famine of food or of thirst for water,

699
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,080
 "but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord.

700
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,000
 "People will stagger from sea to sea

701
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,520
 "and wander from north to east,

702
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,560
 "searching for the word of the Lord,

703
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,680
 "but they will not find it."

704
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,880
 I had asked God to speak to me about my preaching gift,

705
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,440
 and he brings me to this passage where he's like,

706
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,480
 "Andrew, you need to understand that in your life,

707
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,160
 "if you don't make some changes, a famine is coming on you,

708
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,480
 "and that famine will be on hearing the word of God.

709
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,200
 "And you need to understand that what makes a preacher

710
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,080
 "is not how they speak the words of God,

711
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,880
 "but how they hear the words of God.

712
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,480
 "I am nothing if I can't hear the words of God.

713
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,400
 "I am the worst pastor ever.

714
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,880
 "I have nothing to say on this stage,

715
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,320
 "week in and week out, if I can't hear the words of God.

716
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,120
 "If I can't receive and hear something

717
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,520
 "and do my best to package it and bring it to you,

718
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,360
 "if I can't do that, then this is absolutely useless."

719
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,120
 And I sat there under this idea that God's saying,

720
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,560
 "You really want me to speak about your preaching gift?

721
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,200
 "Here's what you need to hear.

722
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,240
 "It's not what you want to hear, Andrew,

723
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,360
 "but here's what you need to hear.

724
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,640
 "A famine is coming on your life

725
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,080
 "where you will be completely useless,

726
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,880
 "no matter how much Bible knowledge you have,

727
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,640
 "no matter how much Greek and Hebrew you might know,

728
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,240
 "completely useless unless you change

729
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,520
 "some things in your life.

730
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,840
 "There's some stuff in your heart, Andrew,

731
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,440
 "that you need to deal with.

732
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,600
 "And if those things don't get dealt with,

733
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,880
 "I will block your ears and you won't hear my word."

734
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,960
 And this led me on a difficult six-month journey

735
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,360
 of dealing with some really important things

736
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,320
 in my soul and my heart that needed to be dealt with,

737
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,400
 things like pride,

738
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,320
 things like arrogance in my cool in life,

739
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,360
 things like thinking I'm better

740
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,160
 because I'm in Bible school than in the marketplace,

741
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,960
 things that were ugly in me,

742
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,360
 other things that I don't want to tell you about.

743
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,680
 And I went through a six-month journey

744
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,080
 of having to bring those things to the Lord

745
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,960
 and have Him deal with me in

746
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,320
 so that I could even think about being

747
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,680
 in the place that I'm in right now

748
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,920
 and doing what I'm doing with you right now.

749
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,040
 And every single time that I prepare a sermon

750
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,400
 here at The Vine, God breathes over me and says,

751
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,880
 "Don't forget Amos 8."

752
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,320
 This has been a disruptive word for me

753
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,600
 that has messed me up inside for years and years and years.

754
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,960
 And by God's grace has enabled me

755
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,120
 to hopefully stand in front of you

756
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,120
 and say some things at times that are helpful to you.

757
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:15,440
 Mary, Mary had this future ahead of her that God could see.

758
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,280
 And so he came in the gentleness of this amazing man, Simeon,

759
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,120
 and said some things to her that were not easy to hear,

760
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,280
 some things that messed some things up inside of her.

761
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,560
 God could see what my future was

762
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,800
 as a young 30-year-old wondering what was going on in life.

763
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,120
 He could see what was gonna happen for me.

764
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,200
 And he said, "You will be a disaster

765
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,400
 "for those people in Hong Kong

766
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,200
 "unless you first deal with this."

767
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,200
 He so loved me and you that he was willing to disrupt

768
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,680
 and make a mess of some things in my life.

769
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,960
 And what you need to understand

770
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,600
 is that God doesn't just come into mess,

771
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,560
 sometimes he creates mess.

772
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,840
 And he creates a mess sometimes by bringing a word

773
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,680
 that is designed to disrupt some faulty old ways

774
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,280
 of thinking in you so that you would be brought

775
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,080
 into new and transformative ways of being.

776
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,400
 That's actually the Christmas story,

777
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:21,000
 that Jesus was willing to disrupt this world,

778
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,280
 willing in the incarnation to come and stir some things up

779
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,000
 so that the world would get a vision of a life

780
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,920
 that is so much greater and so much better

781
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,440
 than the one that was currently being experienced.

782
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,160
 The point of Christmas, the point that Jesus has come

783
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,320
 is so that the world would know

784
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,800
 that there is an alternative way and is the Savior,

785
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,440
 one that can set us free, one that forgives sins,

786
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,760
 one that changes us.

787
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,480
 And we need Jesus to come in to our perfect little worlds

788
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,520
 and mess some things up sometimes

789
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,080
 so that we would come to a place

790
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,760
 where we would truly worship him.

791
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,880
 My heart for you is that you would think about it this way,

792
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,880
 and this is perhaps the more positive way to think about it.

793
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,520
 If you really want to grow as a person in 2024,

794
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,680
 the greatest Christmas gift you can give yourself

795
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,200
 is an open and receptive heart

796
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,800
 to the correction and discipline of God in your life.

797
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,880
 And I know that's not the Christmas Eve message

798
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,080
 you were hoping to hear,

799
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,720
 but I do believe it's the Christmas Eve message

800
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,080
 that God wants you to hear.

801
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,320
 If you took that seriously in 2024,

802
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,680
 you will have your greatest maturing growth

803
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,280
 that you have ever experienced.

804
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,680
 And it's not that God is gonna say those kinds of things

805
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
 all the time to us.

806
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,440
 Of course, God so often and normally and usually speaks

807
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,640
 words of life and hope.

808
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,560
 But let's not close our hearts off

809
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,360
 to the truly transformative moments

810
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,760
 where he puts his little finger on something

811
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,840
 and says, "Let's go on a journey here for a little while.

812
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,280
 "And let's actually allow this thing to get healed

813
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,040
 "and renewed and redeemed for you."

814
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,320
 My prayer for us as a church as we head into the new year

815
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,560
 is that we would have a heart like Samuel

816
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,760
 in the Old Testament who walked into the presence of God

817
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,760
 and said this, "Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening."

818
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,160
 Tomorrow, we're going to give you a really positive,

819
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,760
 happy message on Christmas Day.

820
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,480
 Today, my prayer is that you listened.

821
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,960
 Should we pray?

822
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,320
 Let's pray.

823
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,040
 Father, I am so grateful for all these amazing people

824
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,960
 in this room and the overflow around the building right now.

825
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,560
 Father, I'm thankful that they are so hungry

826
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,720
 to come to worship you on Christmas Eve,

827
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,880
 that they're willing to stand and sit in the aisles,

828
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,760
 sit on the stairs.

829
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,640
 Lord, we honor everybody in this room.

830
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,000
 We're so grateful for the community

831
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,760
 that you've built here at the Vine.

832
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,080
 And Father, we thank you for Christmas

833
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,920
 and the real Christmas story,

834
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,400
 the original one 2,000 years ago.

835
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,480
 We thank you that Luke included a story like this,

836
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,920
 a story that perhaps is different

837
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,200
 from some of the other things we see in the Christmas story,

838
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,240
 a story where Mary sits under

839
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,360
 a challenging prophetic word from God.

840
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:29,440
 And Father, you speak so often words of life,

841
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,200
 the hope and truth.

842
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,360
 And sometimes you speak those words in ways

843
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,120
 that is designed to mess up our perfect worlds,

844
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,520
 particularly when we're misaligned to your will.

845
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,200
 (coughing)

846
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,360
 Father, I pray.

847
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,200
 I pray by your Holy Spirit

848
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,800
 that people here would know the love of God

849
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,200
 seen in the beauty and the wonder of a child

850
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,600
 born in Bethlehem,

851
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:06,000
 that people in this room would know the call that's upon them

852
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,720
 that through relationship with Jesus,

853
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,400
 they can experience the greatest flourishing

854
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,960
 that they will ever experience.

855
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,080
 And that everybody in this room would also know

856
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,640
 the openness of their hearts to whatever it is

857
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,120
 that God wants to say to them.

858
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:27,320
 Father, you know our best far better than we do.

859
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,360
 Father, we lay down our perceived perceptions and hopes

860
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,840
 and positive things that we want.

861
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,680
 Father, we ultimately want you.

862
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,160
 We want your leadership.

863
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,520
 We want your love.

864
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,880
 We wanna become the people that you need us to be

865
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,240
 so that the gospel could be heard in Hong Kong

866
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,800
 like it's never been heard before.

867
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,240
 I pray this Christmas Eve, Lord,

868
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,440
 would be a turning point for some of us here.

869
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,160
 And as we go into the new year,

870
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,720
 we would go in with open and receptive hearts.

871
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,880
 And that maybe there's some words

872
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,280
 that you've been saying to us this year

873
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,440
 that we've gently put to one side.

874
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,120
 Perhaps we've been like, I don't wanna deal with that.

875
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,200
 And maybe as we've unpacked this story today,

876
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,400
 the Holy Spirit has reminded you right now

877
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,920
 of some of those words that God has said to you in the past

878
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,920
 that you've either ignored or put to one side.

879
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,240
 And perhaps your Christmas gift this year

880
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,200
 is God just gently saying,

881
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,160
 I wanna bring you back to that word.

882
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,880
 I wanna bring you back to that thing.

883
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,240
 Let's talk about it.

884
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,920
 I wanna heal you and restore you and redeem you.

885
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,600
 The years of the locust have eaten from you,

886
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,640
 as Joel chapter two would say.

887
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,360
 I wanna restore to you, the Lord says.

888
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,280
 Let me speak.

889
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,160
 Father, I pray that you would speak,

890
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,880
 that Lord, your church would hear,

891
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,720
 and that Lord, together we would glorify you,

892
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,560
 just like those shepherds who left behind the sheep

893
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,760
 and saw the child Jesus in the manger

894
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,040
 and went back glorifying and sharing the news of you.

895
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,800
 Lord, I pray that that would be your church

896
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,840
 at Christmas time.

897
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,080
 And Father, we thank you for this, in Jesus' name.

898
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,960
 Everyone says.

899
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,080
 - Amen. - Amen, amen.

900
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,920
 God bless.
