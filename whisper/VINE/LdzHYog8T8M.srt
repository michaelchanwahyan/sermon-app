1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Well, a couple of months ago, we held Alpha.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,440
 And Alpha, as you know, is this incredible course

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,040
 that allows people to come together

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,480
 to really understand what it means

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,000
 and to know more about Jesus

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,120
 and to share the gospel with those around us.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,280
 And so we wanna hear an incredible story

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,840
 out of our last Alpha, where over 150 guests

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,280
 attended online in April.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,560
 So would you put a hand together for Pastor Jeff

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,880
 and Carl.

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,320
 (audience applauding)

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,280
 - Thank you, Carla.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,360
 Yes, I'm Jess, this is Carl.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,680
 So Alpha happened in April, so we had over 150 guests,

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,560
 but we had over 60 volunteers.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,160
 60 of you joined Alpha as well.

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,600
 And so we wanna tell you what that was like.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,080
 And Carl was one of those volunteers.

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,080
 So tell us, what made you decide to serve on Alpha?

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,420
 - Yeah, well, nice to meet you all.

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,680
 So I've been looking for an opportunity

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,600
 to help out at church.

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,680
 So the Vine is my home church in Hong Kong,

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,840
 and it's really been a blessing to me.

26
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,360
 The community, the broader community,

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,840
 and friendships and the staff as well,

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,400
 and of course Sundays.

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,480
 So I've been looking for a way to participate more

30
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,320
 and kind of root myself more deeply and to give back.

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,560
 So I was familiar with Alpha

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,720
 mostly through my church in the UK.

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,920
 And I've met a number of people

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,440
 who came to faith through Alpha.

35
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,680
 And I sort of hear these stories,

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,320
 and it makes me curious.

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
 But I'm also sort of familiar but curious.

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,720
 So I thought, why is Alpha so impactful for people?

39
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,200
 - So was your small group impactful?

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,280
 How was your small group?

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,120
 Tell us.

42
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,960
 - Yeah.

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,680
 My experience there was actually wonderful.

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,200
 So I approached it very open,

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,600
 kind of open to see what would happen,

46
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,760
 and found that Alpha is indeed a fun, casual,

47
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,960
 and low-pressure environment for both guests and hosts.

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,640
 So I really like the idea of being able to share my faith

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,800
 and to not have to have all the answers,

50
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,560
 despite being someone who works very hard to find answers.

51
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,120
 And to not have to hold to a tight script

52
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,800
 or something like that.

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,960
 As a helper and a group leader,

54
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,720
 I feel the best thing is to be open and to be prayerful

55
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,200
 and see what the Holy Spirit does in guests' lives.

56
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,760
 - Yeah, so can you tell us anything

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,320
 that happened in your small group?

58
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,360
 - Sure, sure, of course.

59
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,520
 So I can jump ahead and tell you about Annabelle.

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,320
 And one of our guests in my group, Annabelle,

61
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,960
 gave us permission to share her story.

62
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,760
 So Annabelle was born into a Christian family

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,920
 and was christened as a baby.

64
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,640
 But she said she did not have a relationship with Jesus.

65
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,120
 When she was 18, her father passed away from cancer,

66
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,280
 and before his death, he was in pain.

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,760
 He was depressed, and he was so scared

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
 for his family's future,

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,640
 as Annabelle had an eight-year-old and a 10-year-old brother.

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,360
 So this confirmed basically all her doubts

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,980
 about Christianity.

72
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,140
 She could not believe that a God

73
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,920
 could allow this kind of suffering.

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,640
 Then about a year and a half ago,

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,680
 she was struggling with life in general,

76
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,120
 and a friend invited her to the Vine

77
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,060
 where she heard about Alpha

78
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,920
 and how Alpha is an opportunity

79
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,140
 to explore the meaning of life.

80
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,980
 So she joined.

81
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,560
 So this is how Annabelle described her experience.

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,040
 She says, "I am quite introverted,

83
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,800
 "and sharing my thoughts, struggles,

84
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,880
 "and questions with friends can be a struggle,

85
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,980
 "let alone with strangers.

86
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,460
 "However, my group hosts were so welcoming and friendly,

87
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,760
 "and they made everyone feel at ease quickly.

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,780
 "It was clear from the start that it was a safe space.

89
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,240
 "At first, I expected the host to give me answers

90
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,280
 "to my questions and to correct me

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,400
 "for my misunderstandings.

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,480
 "But I soon realized that this was not the purpose

93
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,080
 "of a group host.

94
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,840
 "They were there to guide our discussion,

95
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,260
 "to ensure everyone was heard,

96
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,380
 "and to keep us focused on the topic.

97
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,760
 "Listening to Nicky Gumbel,"

98
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,840
 we used Alpha videos, and Nicky Gumbel is the main speaker,

99
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,960
 "listening to Nicky Gumbel share his journey

100
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,800
 "was truly inspirational.

101
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,620
 "And it's hard not to have faith in God

102
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,000
 "when you listen to what he and others have experienced."

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
 And personally, too, I was actually very touched

104
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,120
 by a lot of the testimonies that were shared.

105
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,220
 Very powerful.

106
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,580
 Back to Annabelle.

107
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,980
 "I soon began to look forward to the meeting each week

108
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
 "and to hear more from my group members.

109
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,400
 "The Alpha Day was the first time

110
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,480
 "that we all met in person.

111
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,800
 "It was an amazing experience,

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,500
 "which culminated in a time of prayer

113
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,380
 "and asking to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

114
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,920
 "I now have a relationship with God,

115
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,040
 "but if I were to compare my relationship with God

116
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,240
 "to how I would write a child's report at school,"

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,380
 Annabelle is a teacher,

118
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,580
 "I would categorize their demonstration of a skill

119
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,060
 "as not yet developing or consisting,

120
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,020
 "consistently, rather not yet, comma,

121
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,280
 "developing, comma, or consistently."

122
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
 I believe in Oxford commas, by the way.

123
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,340
 [audience laughing]

124
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,180
 "I would say I am developing my relationship with God.

125
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,540
 "I know that God hears me through prayer,

126
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,100
 "and I'm already starting to feel that I've been heard.

127
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
 "Through Alpha, I learned that there was more to life

128
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,380
 "than what I had been living,

129
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,140
 "and that God has a purpose for everyone, including me.

130
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,140
 "I better understand why God allows people to suffer

131
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,880
 "and why bad things happen to good people.

132
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,700
 "Having Jesus in my life has helped me

133
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,800
 "to widen my understanding of myself

134
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,620
 "and be more comfortable in my own skin.

135
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,260
 "It has led me to have a more positive outlook on life

136
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,020
 "and my life path.

137
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,640
 "I find comfort in knowing that God's love is unconditional,

138
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,940
 "and he will forgive my sins

139
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,000
 "and help me to become a better person."

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,060
 - Isn't that amazing?

141
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,500
 Isn't that a great story?

142
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,340
 Yeah.

143
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,160
 [audience applauding]

144
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,360
 Alpha, we're starting Alpha again, 5th of October.

145
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,920
 So we're launching the second Churchwide Alpha this year,

146
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,640
 and we would love you to all be involved.

147
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,000
 And you can be involved in three ways.

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,840
 So we can put on the best Alpha,

149
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,800
 but we need you to invite your friends.

150
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,200
 So Alpha is aimed at people outside of the church.

151
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,400
 So invite those who don't yet know Jesus

152
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,600
 to come and hear the good news about Jesus,

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,800
 just like Annabelle was invited.

154
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,880
 So invite your friends, and here you'll find two QR codes.

155
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,600
 The first one is the course signup.

156
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,400
 That's something that you can send to your guests

157
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,800
 to sign up for Alpha.

158
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,280
 But for you to be part of Alpha, there are three ways.

159
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,680
 You can be like Carl,

160
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,800
 come and be a small group hoster helper.

161
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,640
 There's training.

162
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,500
 The second thing is because this is happening online again,

163
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,800
 if you're familiar with Zoom,

164
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,680
 we would love to borrow your tech capabilities.

165
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,040
 Very important to come and help.

166
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,840
 Or the Alpha Day, we heard about the Alpha Day.

167
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,280
 This is the one day we have in person in here

168
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,880
 where we talk about the Holy Spirit.

169
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,280
 You can volunteer in person on that day as well.

170
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,160
 So yes, come and join,

171
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,920
 and let's share the love of Jesus with our city.

172
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,760
 Does that sound good?

173
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,320
 - Yeah. - Great.

174
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,160
 Thank you.

175
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,000
 Thank you, Carl.

176
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,520
 Let's give Carl a round of applause.

177
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,840
 (audience applauding)

178
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,640
 - Thanks so much, Carl.

179
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,480
 Carl's amazing.

180
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,440
 I've gotten to know Carl quite well over the last few months,

181
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,600
 year or so, two years, three, I don't know, how long.

182
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,000
 Long time, amazing man, get to know him.

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,640
 Hey, everyone, how you doing?

184
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
 Upper house.

185
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,960
 (audience laughing)

186
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,160
 You guys are all asleep, and I woke you up.

187
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,040
 It's so great to be with you.

188
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,800
 I tell you what, I tell you, my name's Andrew, by the way.

189
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,680
 If you're new to the Vine, so great to have you here.

190
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,400
 I'm one of the pastors.

191
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,880
 I could not be more excited about the next number of weeks

192
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,020
 that are ahead of us here at the Vine.

193
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,340
 We're going to be starting a brand new sermon series

194
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,120
 next Sunday on Psalm 23.

195
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,720
 Perhaps the most important, the most famous Psalm,

196
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,920
 the most beloved Psalm that we have in the Scriptures.

197
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,960
 And we're calling this series, "A Restful Presence,

198
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,680
 Psalm 23 for an Anxious World."

199
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,560
 And the reason why we're doing this,

200
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,480
 and I'm gonna be teaching through the whole series.

201
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,420
 We're gonna do about five weeks with each other.

202
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,180
 We're gonna unpack every verse of that Psalm.

203
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,400
 But the reason why we're doing it

204
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,880
 is because we believe that this Psalm

205
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,880
 is not just a personal call to find a place of rest in God,

206
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,720
 a personal call to have God as our shepherd

207
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,880
 and for us to know security,

208
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,600
 but actually Psalm 23 is about a discipleship.

209
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,760
 It's about a way in which we are to live in the world.

210
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,160
 In other words, Psalm 23 is not just a place

211
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,880
 for personal rest.

212
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,920
 Psalm 23 is designed for us to be a restful presence

213
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,280
 planted in a chaotic world.

214
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
 So when the world is freaking out,

215
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,980
 when the world is struggling with all the things

216
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,200
 that it's struggling with right now,

217
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,400
 when the world is trying to find its feet and get settled,

218
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,560
 it looks to the church and it says,

219
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,480
 the church is suffering all the same things

220
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,860
 that we're suffering, but they're not freaking out.

221
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,700
 Why?

222
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,800
 That's what Psalm 23 is about.

223
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,960
 It's about teaching the people of God

224
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,560
 how to find themselves a non-anxious presence

225
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,440
 in an anxious world.

226
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,320
 And I wanna tell you this.

227
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,660
 If you could get your head around that,

228
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,480
 if you could begin to wrestle with the idea

229
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,720
 that God can enable you to be at peace

230
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 despite the craziness of this world,

231
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,040
 you will be incredibly attractive

232
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,480
 to those in your sphere of influence.

233
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,040
 I can't tell you the number of times in my life

234
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,720
 where people have come up to me and said,

235
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
 people that don't know Jesus,

236
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,320
 why are you so at peace when things seem to be so crazy?

237
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,560
 And if you're anything like me,

238
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,780
 there's a lot of times in your life

239
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,940
 where you're also crazy,

240
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,360
 where you're also overwhelmed.

241
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,700
 Hands up if you're feeling a little stressed

242
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,000
 or anxious even right now.

243
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,840
 You're all lying, okay?

244
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,580
 We do, don't we?

245
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,980
 We feel stressed, we feel anxious, we feel overwhelmed,

246
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,960
 but Psalm 23 is an invitation

247
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,000
 not just to find personal peace,

248
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,280
 but to be that peace, to show the world.

249
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,920
 And I can't tell you how more attractive it is

250
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,920
 for people to say, wow, I want to be like that

251
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
 and not like I currently am,

252
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,580
 freaking out all over the place.

253
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,120
 So starting from next Sunday,

254
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,080
 I'm gonna unpack that over five weeks.

255
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,840
 I cannot think of a better sermon series

256
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,200
 for you to invite your friends and family to than this.

257
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,320
 Hands up if you have any stressed people

258
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,360
 in your friend group or family.

259
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,560
 Right, invite them to church next week.

260
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,960
 This will be a great opportunity

261
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,640
 for them to hear about that.

262
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,800
 But today, before we get into Psalm 23 next week,

263
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,780
 I wanna do today a one-off message

264
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,440
 that I'm sort of seeing as a precursor,

265
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,500
 a prequel, if you will, to help prepare you

266
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 as best as possible for Psalm 23 that's coming next week.

267
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,460
 Because as I spent the last couple of months

268
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,140
 studying Psalm 23, and I've gone into quite a bit

269
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,220
 of research in detail about this Psalm,

270
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,620
 something struck me quite powerfully.

271
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,100
 And as I dug deeper into the Psalm,

272
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,580
 I realized that there is some critical spiritual work

273
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,340
 that has to happen for all of us

274
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,800
 before we can begin to appreciate the power

275
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,780
 of what Psalm 23 is actually inviting us into.

276
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,460
 In fact, if we don't do this important spiritual work first,

277
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,060
 we're gonna miss out on everything

278
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,840
 that I think God wants to share to us in that series.

279
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,060
 The idea that before we can begin to think

280
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,340
 about what it is for God to be our shepherd,

281
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,900
 before we can begin to think about what it is

282
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,140
 for us to be led by quiet waters and into green pastures,

283
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,900
 before we can understand the power there is

284
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,820
 in being led through the valley of the shadow of death,

285
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,660
 of having a table laid before our enemies,

286
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,820
 of understanding that goodness and mercy will follow us

287
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,460
 for the rest of our lives, before we do any of that,

288
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,340
 we have to realize that there's an internal spiritual battle

289
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,700
 that is happening in every single one of us

290
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,260
 that is stopping us from receiving

291
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,460
 what Psalm 23 is all about.

292
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,660
 And here's what that internal battle is.

293
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,900
 The opening of Psalm 23 says,

294
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,900
 "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want."

295
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,040
 The internal battle that we are all struggling with

296
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,700
 is that we wanna be the shepherd.

297
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,980
 Think about it.

298
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,120
 That we wanna be the ones in control.

299
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,000
 That we wanna be the ones that has it all worked out.

300
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,640
 And so this is as simply as I could put it for today.

301
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,820
 Before God can be our shepherd, we need to learn to be sheep

302
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,300
 because what is that metaphor?

303
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,140
 If we're declaring that God is our shepherd,

304
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,120
 we are ultimately saying we are his sheep.

305
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,340
 We are his flock and we follow after him.

306
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,340
 The reality is, here's how Psalm 23 starts

307
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,200
 for the most of us.

308
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,320
 I am the shepherd, where are my sheep?

309
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,360
 For I'll make you lay down in quiet orders.

310
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,800
 We have this tendency as humans to take control,

311
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,740
 to take power.

312
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,340
 And I think what we have to wrestle with deeply

313
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,220
 is why is this taking place inside of us

314
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,540
 and how come when it happens,

315
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,100
 although we think we're gonna find peace,

316
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,220
 ultimately all that ever results

317
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,460
 is more stress and anxiety for us.

318
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,860
 Is God really your shepherd?

319
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,780
 Well, if you're anything like me,

320
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,580
 I think your response to that question might be sometimes.

321
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,100
 I'm the pastor of a church.

322
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,300
 So I can imagine for a lot of us sitting here

323
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,980
 for watching online right now,

324
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,740
 you're going, yeah, sometimes for me too.

325
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,880
 There's another passage in scripture in the Psalms

326
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,180
 that's almost as famous as Psalm 23

327
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,200
 that is designed, I think,

328
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,720
 to help us prepare our hearts and our lives

329
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,900
 for all that Psalm 23 has.

330
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,780
 And that Psalm is Psalm 46, verse 10.

331
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,740
 And here's what it says.

332
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,720
 Be still and know that I am God.

333
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,140
 (sighs)

334
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,140
 Isn't that a wonderful word?

335
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,140
 Just be still and know that I am God.

336
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,220
 Oh, we've heard that said so many times.

337
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,740
 Isn't it like just welcoming you into like a fluffy cloud?

338
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,180
 Just chill out and have a vacation with God.

339
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,660
 It's time just to allow him to be God

340
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,920
 and just you to chill out.

341
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,740
 This idea of being still and knowing that God is God

342
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,260
 is constantly spoken to us by fridge magnets

343
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,220
 around the world, by bumper stickers,

344
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
 by Instagram and Facebook posts.

345
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,020
 And here's what you'll see

346
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,900
 kind of accompanying this idea of being still

347
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,220
 and knowing that God is God.

348
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,780
 We will see the cheesiest,

349
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,660
 lowest form of art ever accompany this.

350
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,380
 Like when people are trying to communicate to you

351
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,060
 what it is to be still and know that God is God,

352
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,900
 the Christians amongst us will try to provide

353
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,460
 the My Little Pony moments of art

354
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,700
 to make you try to feel like you're at peace, all right?

355
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,300
 I went on the interwebs this week

356
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,740
 and I pulled out four simple examples

357
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,540
 that I think are quite summative

358
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,420
 of all of the stuff you'll find on the interweb.

359
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,260
 Are you ready?

360
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,100
 Here's the first one.

361
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,060
 This is the first one.

362
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,900
 It's the Scandinavian mountain view, right?

363
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,200
 Like if you wanna be still and know that God is God,

364
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,180
 go to Sweden, right?

365
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,740
 Like everybody in Sweden knows God, right?

366
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,320
 Like 'cause they stare at that all the time, right?

367
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,180
 So you have these kind of Scandinavian mountain view pictures.

368
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,260
 Here's the second one.

369
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,820
 This one I call the butterflies, yes.

370
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,740
 Like if we wanna be still and know that God is God,

371
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,820
 we must be hippies.

372
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,540
 Ah, enjoying the beautiful stillness of blue light

373
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,340
 and shadows and butterflies.

374
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,180
 Or how about this one?

375
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,180
 This one's pretty full on.

376
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,680
 This one is the forest

377
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,260
 that's turned into a psychedelic picture.

378
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,460
 This is like somebody was eating mushrooms in the forest

379
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,820
 and now they think that God is God.

380
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,420
 They're like so freaked out by the colors of the forest.

381
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
 Are you with me?

382
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,180
 That suddenly they think that God is still

383
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,740
 and they know him or something like that.

384
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,000
 Now here's my ultimate, ultimate, I can't stand it.

385
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,840
 We all know it.

386
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,460
 It's the cheesiest Christian symbol

387
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,020
 that there is on the internet.

388
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,960
 It is the man and the woman

389
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,380
 that stand before the sunrise and go like this.

390
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,820
 Yes, be still and know that I am God.

391
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,240
 (sighs)

392
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,880
 Every single one of these horrible works of art,

393
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,540
 I shudder to even say that.

394
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,100
 Every single one of these pieces of stuff

395
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,380
 is designed to try to sugar you into thinking

396
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,460
 what this text is all about.

397
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,900
 That oh, just be still, just chill out,

398
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,140
 just enjoy the sunrise,

399
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,700
 get out there in nature a little bit more,

400
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,380
 see the beauty of the world,

401
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,740
 crawl up onto Jesus' lap

402
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,580
 and place your head on his heartbeat.

403
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,140
 Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

404
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,600
 (audience laughing)

405
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,980
 The reality is this picture that accompanies

406
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,580
 this idea of being still and knowing that God is God

407
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,660
 is about as far away from the original context

408
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,500
 of that passage that there can be.

409
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,380
 In fact, if you read the broader context of Psalm 46,

410
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,140
 you'll be amazed that there aren't any my little ponies

411
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,580
 or butterflies or wonderful ideas of sunsets

412
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,620
 and people standing there like this.

413
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,020
 Instead, the broader context of Psalm 46

414
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,980
 welcomes you into war, to fighting,

415
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,980
 to trauma, to turmoil,

416
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,740
 to the fact that humanity is trying to kill itself.

417
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,020
 It's interesting, the wallpaper

418
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,340
 that should be accompanying this verse

419
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,980
 is people fighting each other.

420
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,860
 Could you imagine throwing that onto your fridge?

421
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,300
 Fighting people, be still and know that I am God.

422
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,220
 Let me actually read to you the fullness

423
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,780
 of this passage in Psalm 46

424
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,100
 'cause I wanna unpack this a little bit together.

425
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,660
 It's 11 verses, it's good to read scripture in church, amen?

426
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,220
 Are you ready?

427
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,180
 It says this, "God is our refuge and strength

428
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,020
 and ever present help in trouble."

429
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,540
 Notice that, trouble.

430
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,620
 "Therefore we will not fear."

431
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,260
 Now notice this, "Though the earth give away,

432
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,500
 though the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,

433
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,060
 though its waters roar and foam comes

434
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,700
 and the mountains quake with their surging."

435
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,220
 But there is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,

436
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,900
 the holy place where the most high dwells.

437
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,340
 God is within her, she will not fall.

438
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,220
 God will help her at the break of day.

439
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,220
 But the reality is nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall.

440
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,660
 He lifts up his voice, the earth melts.

441
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,220
 But the Lord Almighty is with us.

442
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,940
 The God of Jacob is our fortress.

443
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,020
 Come and see the works of the Lord,

444
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,940
 the desolations he has brought on the earth.

445
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,420
 For he makes wars that are happening all the time.

446
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,880
 He is inferring here, he makes wars cease

447
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,940
 to the ends of the earth.

448
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,900
 He breaks the bow and shatters the spear.

449
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,940
 Or in other words, he snaps the missiles

450
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,940
 and breaks down the guns.

451
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,300
 He burns the chariots with fire.

452
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,900
 He crushes the tanks.

453
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,780
 He stops the bitter battle.

454
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,420
 Be still and know that I am God.

455
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,580
 For I will be exalted amongst the nations.

456
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,340
 I will be exalted in the earth.

457
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,940
 The Lord Almighty is with us.

458
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,220
 The God of Jacob, our fortress.

459
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,540
 Can you see that there's not a Scandinavian

460
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,380
 mountain view in sight?

461
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,780
 And what the Psalmist is trying to communicate here

462
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,660
 is the reality of the world in which we live.

463
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,120
 He's not trying to make Christians get away

464
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,460
 from the reality that the world is a hard place.

465
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,060
 And the imagery, let me show you this imagery again.

466
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,380
 This idea of, he uses nature as imagery,

467
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,460
 that the earth give away,

468
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,580
 the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.

469
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,380
 Though its waters roar and foam,

470
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,160
 the mountains quake with surging.

471
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,700
 Later on, he speaks about nations in uproar,

472
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,140
 kingdoms falling.

473
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,660
 This language in ancient Near Eastern poetic language

474
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,780
 and form is not actually speaking about the nature

475
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,620
 of the world.

476
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,900
 It's actually a metaphor to speak about humanity

477
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,020
 by the what we're doing to one another.

478
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,060
 It's a little bit like how the world is fighting each other

479
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,580
 and everything's falling down

480
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,640
 and all the horrible things are happening in nature.

481
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,660
 That's what's happening in us.

482
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,580
 That's what's happening between us.

483
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,700
 We're battling and raging with one another.

484
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,300
 We're trying to fight and be better than the other person.

485
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,660
 Nations are in uproar about nations

486
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,340
 and all of this is taking place.

487
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,980
 And it's not what God has originally intended,

488
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,660
 but it's the reality of this world.

489
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,140
 And I think today, some sort of 3000 years later

490
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,700
 for when this verse was written,

491
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,200
 we come to think that that's still our world today.

492
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,900
 This is not some butterflies and soft lighting.

493
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,100
 This is the reality of what we're sitting in.

494
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,540
 In fact, I think if you were to write Psalm 46 today,

495
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,500
 here's some of the modern imagery and language

496
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,340
 we might use.

497
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,100
 The nations are at war.

498
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,080
 Governments are a mess.

499
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,020
 People are no longer trusting the very people they used to.

500
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,420
 We are posting hatred and hurt, fake news and lies

501
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,420
 and canceling each other left and right.

502
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,540
 Are you with me?

503
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,140
 Do you get the vibe here?

504
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,900
 This is what's happening in our time.

505
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
 It's the same kind of expression

506
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,780
 that the Psalmist is trying to bring in his time.

507
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,200
 And it's all designed to make the reader read the Psalm,

508
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,740
 read the poem and ask a really critical question.

509
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,480
 Why is this happening?

510
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,580
 I wonder if in the last couple of years,

511
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,180
 as you've seen this stuff take place,

512
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,580
 maybe you've asked yourself the same.

513
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,760
 Why is this always happening?

514
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,200
 Well, to answer that, we have to step back

515
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,580
 and look at the broader context of Israel

516
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,300
 in the Old Testament.

517
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,980
 Because the Psalmist is writing this

518
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,860
 to the people of God in the Old Testament times,

519
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,420
 to Israel themselves, challenging them

520
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,760
 on the way in which they're acting.

521
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,800
 And if you trace in biblical theology

522
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,940
 what Israel did in the Old Testament times,

523
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,800
 when they faced a catastrophe,

524
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,860
 when something went wrong for Israel,

525
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,860
 here's what you see throughout the Old Testament journey,

526
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,660
 time in and time again.

527
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,780
 They would find themselves in a place

528
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,220
 of being out of control and in a panic,

529
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,140
 they would do whatever they could to get back into control.

530
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,020
 So how they would do that very often

531
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,620
 in the pages of the Old Testament,

532
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,740
 is that they would think about some schemes

533
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,140
 that would enable them to feel like they're back in control.

534
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,740
 So they would often try to strengthen their army

535
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,480
 in times that they felt insecure.

536
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,920
 They would sometimes reach out to the nations around them

537
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,180
 and create political alliances.

538
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,940
 Sometimes, oftentimes, they would push God to one side

539
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,840
 and begin to worship other gods,

540
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,580
 thinking, well, we're in a place

541
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,300
 where we've been worshipping Yahweh,

542
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,180
 it doesn't seem to be doing any good,

543
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,200
 we're out of control,

544
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,860
 well, let's just jettison what we really believe

545
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,140
 and let's start worshipping all these tribal gods

546
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,380
 in the hopes that someone, somewhere, it would stick

547
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,500
 and we would find peace again.

548
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,020
 It's fascinating to me that human nature,

549
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,380
 when things are difficult,

550
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,480
 even for the people of God, is to do this,

551
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,480
 to push God to one side and put ourselves in His place.

552
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,380
 When we're overwhelmed, when we're anxious,

553
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,700
 when we feel like we're spinning out of control,

554
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,580
 very often what we do is we try to grasp a hold of control

555
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,260
 in our sphere of influence and our lives

556
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,860
 by placing ourselves in the center place,

557
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,580
 but by actually taking on the responsibility of providing

558
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,020
 and making things secure.

559
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,580
 And so we reach out and we grasp a hold

560
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
 of the other things around our lives

561
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,620
 that we think are gonna bring us stability

562
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,820
 and push God out of that picture.

563
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,500
 Are you tracking with this so far?

564
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,860
 Now, here's why this is important to you,

565
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,340
 because if you go right back in biblical theology

566
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,340
 to the beginning of sin in Genesis 3,

567
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,700
 what is it that you see there?

568
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,260
 What is the original temptation that Satan brings humanity?

569
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,300
 He shows up and he says, "You need to eat

570
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,540
 "of that one fruit that God told you not to eat from,

571
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,740
 "the fruit of the knowledge of God and evil.

572
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,460
 "And the reason why you need to eat that

573
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,220
 "is because when you eat it," guess what?

574
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,060
 "You'll become like God.

575
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,220
 "You won't be his image anymore.

576
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,900
 "You'll actually be like him.

577
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,900
 "You'll be your own God."

578
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,900
 That was the original temptation in the garden.

579
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,900
 That is the underlying temptation of all sin,

580
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,900
 that we push God to one side and we become God's ourselves.

581
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,460
 And if you think about the reality of the last three years

582
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,220
 here in Hong Kong, and you think about all the turmoil

583
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,060
 that we've gone through,

584
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,060
 all the things that we've struggled with,

585
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,620
 it's been so easy for us to push God to one side and go,

586
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,780
 "I need to find stability and control.

587
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,340
 "So I'm gonna work harder.

588
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,700
 "I'm gonna earn more money.

589
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,180
 "I'm gonna do the things that I know to do

590
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,420
 "to create some sense of control

591
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,860
 "in my ever spinning out of control life."

592
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,440
 It's very easy for us to become the shepherd.

593
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,100
 Are you with me?

594
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,420
 And we do it because we're trying to find control

595
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,100
 in a life that's quickly spinning out of control.

596
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,420
 Let me just say this to you.

597
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,540
 You cannot control everything.

598
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,180
 You were not designed to be God.

599
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,720
 You were designed to be his image.

600
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,100
 And God's placed his character and his love and his power

601
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,220
 and his mercy and his grace and his wonder in you.

602
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,040
 And it's an amazing thing,

603
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,660
 but you were not created to carry the weight

604
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,700
 that God carries, to carry the struggle

605
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,860
 that he holds in his heart and his hands.

606
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,100
 You were not designed to take all of the struggle

607
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,020
 and the trouble of life on your shoulders.

608
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,860
 You were not designed to be exhausted

609
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,860
 because you're trying to provide for yourself

610
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,220
 and find stability and you push God to one side.

611
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,600
 That was not how you were created to be.

612
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,140
 And we sit here wondering why we're exhausted.

613
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,960
 It's 'cause we're playing God.

614
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,320
 Here's a reality that if you can get your head around this,

615
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,080
 really understand this, this will completely set you free.

616
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,220
 When we drive ourselves constantly to find control

617
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,360
 in an ever-changing world,

618
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,340
 we will only ever be more and more out of control.

619
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,920
 Come on, church.

620
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,660
 If you constantly are striving

621
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,020
 to find control in your life,

622
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,420
 and if you're the one who's putting that pressure

623
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,720
 on yourself to find that control, find the answers,

624
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,480
 find things settling down through your own strength,

625
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,280
 you will only find yourself more and more at war

626
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,420
 to use the imagery of Psalm 46.

627
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,260
 Why?

628
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,640
 Because when you place yourself in the center of your world

629
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
 and you push God to one side,

630
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,900
 when you try to provide for yourself

631
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,800
 where God should be providing for you,

632
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,240
 when you try to find security for yourself,

633
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,200
 when God can only be that security,

634
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,760
 here's what you will do.

635
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,500
 You will provide for yourself at the expense of the other.

636
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,000
 You will do all that you can yourself

637
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
 at the expense of another.

638
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,000
 In other words, you will be at enmity

639
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,280
 with the people around you,

640
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,240
 because if they can't help you, you will pull them down.

641
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,260
 You will do everything you can to protect me, myself, and I.

642
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,920
 And what happens when we do that

643
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,880
 is we actually end up in more stress,

644
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,720
 more anxiousness, more fear.

645
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,640
 We actually feel more overwhelmed,

646
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,040
 which ironically causes us to hold on tighter even more

647
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,440
 to the reality that we are God.

648
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,440
 Now, this is a cycle that Psalm 46

649
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,320
 is trying to communicate to us.

650
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,160
 And let me show you this.

651
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,680
 I call this the being God cycle.

652
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,520
 Here it is.

653
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
 So there's being God.

654
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,960
 Now, how that starts is we try to grasp a hold,

655
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,360
 hold on and grasp a hold of the things in our lives.

656
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,720
 And that grasping together,

657
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,980
 that kind of grasping of control

658
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,740
 is the very thing that we think is gonna set us free,

659
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,960
 but actually all it does is creates more fear,

660
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,200
 more turmoil, more trouble, and more war.

661
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,880
 And because we're now in a place

662
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,480
 where we're actually more overwhelmed

663
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,600
 than we were to start with, guess what we do?

664
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,440
 We try to grasp on control even more,

665
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,360
 which then sets us off in a place of turmoil,

666
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
 war, and strife again.

667
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,000
 And suddenly there's a cycle

668
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,560
 that's taking place in our lives,

669
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,720
 and we're wondering why we're exhausted.

670
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,000
 We're wondering why here in Hong Kong

671
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,080
 we're running on a treadmill.

672
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,600
 We're wondering why it is

673
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,960
 that we're constantly stressed and overwhelmed

674
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,520
 and wondering why we don't have stability in our lives.

675
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,280
 It's because we're being God.

676
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:55,520
 And the question is, is there another way to live?

677
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,120
 Enter Psalm 46, verse 10.

678
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,320
 "Be still and know that I am God."

679
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,280
 There's no Scandinavian mountaintop here.

680
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,040
 There is a command of God.

681
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,720
 This is the only time in the whole Psalm

682
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,640
 where God speaks in the first person.

683
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,440
 This is a command of God to a stressed-out humanity

684
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,960
 that is playing God.

685
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,800
 And he says, "Be still."

686
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,940
 There is another way to live.

687
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:35,220
 The Hebrew word for "be still" here is the word rafa.

688
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,480
 You have to roll your R when you say it, rafa.

689
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,140
 It sounds like, I don't know, the Lion King or something.

690
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,980
 Rafa.

691
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,220
 Rafa means this.

692
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,020
 It means to cease.

693
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,700
 It means to stop.

694
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,380
 It means to stop striving, cease striving.

695
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,860
 It means to release.

696
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,140
 It means to actually become weak.

697
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,140
 It means to basically give up the idea that we are God.

698
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,180
 In fact, in the poetic language of the ancient Near East,

699
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,820
 when rafa is used, it's often referred to in a metaphor

700
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,460
 as the place of the dead.

701
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,760
 When it's used in this scripture in this point,

702
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,760
 it's actually speaking of dying to self, dying to yourself.

703
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,800
 So far from the butterflies, my ponies,

704
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,300
 and the Scandinavian villages,

705
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,500
 what God is doing is coming to a stressed-out humanity

706
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,340
 who are putting themselves as God and has shoved Him aside.

707
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,100
 And He's saying, "Stop it.

708
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,220
 Stop your ridiculous activity.

709
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,020
 Stop the ridiculous propensity that you have

710
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,380
 to try to be God.

711
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,780
 You can't be God.

712
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,420
 And if you try to be God,

713
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,500
 you're just gonna be stressed out, overwhelmed.

714
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,780
 The cycle's gonna continue.

715
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,020
 Just stop it."

716
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,100
 Do you feel it?

717
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,300
 Do you feel His passion for you?

718
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,220
 He's standing over you, not telling you off,

719
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,980
 but inviting you to a different way

720
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,220
 where He becomes central in everything.

721
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,900
 He's saying, "Cease this activity right here, right now.

722
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,780
 Stop being God," which is why when He says, "Be still,"

723
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,300
 rafa in the Hebrew, it's immediately followed by,

724
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,460
 "And know that I am God."

725
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,540
 Notice that.

726
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,580
 Sometimes when we read this verse,

727
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,620
 we think it's, "Be still and know that I am God."

728
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,180
 In the Hebrew, the emphasis is this,

729
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,020
 "Be still and know that I am God."

730
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,700
 Not you, not you.

731
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,620
 I haven't created you to be that way.

732
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,300
 And you've got all this stuff on your shoulders

733
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,820
 and you're trying to carry so much

734
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,860
 and you're trying to be the answer for all your family

735
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,020
 and all your kids and you're trying to work it all out

736
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,900
 and you're trying to have all your eyes dotted

737
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,100
 and all your teeth crossed

738
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,580
 and all you're doing is getting more stressed,

739
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,540
 more overwhelmed, more fed up, more angry, more bitter.

740
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,500
 And you're beginning to not like the people around you

741
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,700
 in your life and there's burnout after burnout.

742
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,700
 Stop and allow me to be what I am.

743
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,380
 I am and you be what you are.

744
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,540
 Let go.

745
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:07,020
 Stop grasping and allow me to be God.

746
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:13,060
 This idea of stopping grasping is quite personal for me.

747
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,380
 Over the last two years of COVID,

748
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,380
 I've been working out as you can tell.

749
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,060
 And you shouldn't laugh that much.

750
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,300
 That's a little offensive.

751
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,420
 But I have a gym at home.

752
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,980
 I set up a home gym because I knew the gyms would close

753
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,500
 and stuff and I wanted to continue to work out.

754
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,580
 So I set up a home gym

755
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,940
 and I've been working with a personal trainer.

756
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,620
 And you know those memes where like,

757
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,420
 you look at the gym mirror and you're like a buff person

758
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
 and then you look at your home mirror

759
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,580
 and you're flabby, right?

760
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,900
 We have this propensity when we're in the gym

761
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,460
 to think we're way bigger and better and greater

762
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,900
 than we actually are in real life.

763
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,700
 And about two months ago,

764
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,500
 I've been pushing my dumbbells a lot

765
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,900
 and really kind of working on that.

766
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,580
 And I was getting a pain happening down my arm.

767
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,780
 And I said to my personal trainer one week,

768
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,420
 I said, "I know why I'm getting this pain.

769
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,460
 I've got this pain in my arm.

770
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,580
 I'm getting it because I'm trying to lift too heavy.

771
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,980
 I pump so well.

772
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,580
 I'm so good at doing dumbbell."

773
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,420
 You know, like I was speaking myself up,

774
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,580
 feeling great about the incredibly heavy weight

775
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,060
 that I was lifting.

776
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,620
 And he was like, "Where's your pain?"

777
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,580
 And I'm like, "Oh, it's like shoots up

778
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,420
 like just right here."

779
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,660
 And he sort of looks at my arm and he sort of stands back.

780
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,700
 He's like, "Hmm."

781
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,140
 He goes, "Andrew, I don't think your problem

782
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,020
 is actually the weight that you're trying to lift.

783
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,980
 Because I think the problem is

784
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,940
 you're gripping the barbell too hard."

785
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,460
 And then he said this to me.

786
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,780
 He said, "You'd be able to lift a lot more

787
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,860
 if you just let go."

788
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:42,500
 God comes to a stressed out humanity in Psalm 46.

789
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,340
 And he says, "Guess what?

790
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,700
 It's counterintuitive, but it's awesome 'cause it's me.

791
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,140
 You would be able to carry a lot more

792
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,620
 if you just let go."

793
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,820
 See, some of you are crushing under a weight

794
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,460
 that actually you can carry.

795
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,820
 But you're crushed under that weight.

796
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,020
 It's a weight that God has given you,

797
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,540
 but you're crushed under it

798
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,020
 because you're trying to be God in it.

799
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,860
 You're trying to make the answers happen.

800
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,820
 You're trying to take control.

801
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,460
 And so the weight's crushing you, but guess what?

802
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,860
 You can lift, you can carry.

803
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,220
 You can carry the very weight

804
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,740
 that God has placed upon your life

805
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,860
 if you simply let grow of the grasping.

806
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,700
 If you let God be God again,

807
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,980
 if you let Him hold the weight for you,

808
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,340
 if you let Him be the one who is in control.

809
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,260
 He says, "Be still and know that I am God,

810
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,220
 that I'm the one at work here.

811
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,900
 I'm the shepherd.

812
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,740
 And when I'm the shepherd, you are not at once."

813
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,980
 But the problem is,

814
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:48,620
 the problem is we are so often in God's place.

815
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,820
 Now, I want you to hear something

816
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,340
 really, really, really carefully here.

817
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,940
 I am not saying let go of your responsibilities.

818
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,100
 I am not saying let go of the God-given gifts

819
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,220
 that God has given you,

820
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,860
 the stewardship of resources

821
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,540
 that He's put around your life,

822
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,380
 the wonderful talents and gifts and inspiration

823
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,580
 you have, He's not saying let go of your dreams.

824
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,300
 He's saying, "Let go of carrying the very things

825
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,020
 that I have not called you to carry.

826
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,420
 Let go of trying to control the things

827
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,980
 that only I can control.

828
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,780
 Let go of trying to control the things

829
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,180
 that you were not designed or created to control."

830
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,100
 Those are the things.

831
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,700
 He's not saying it's time to quit.

832
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,260
 He's not saying it's time to give up.

833
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,820
 He's not saying it's time to just wait on God

834
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,660
 to do everything.

835
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,660
 He's given you gifts, He's given you talents,

836
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,740
 He's given you a mind, He wants you to use it.

837
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,100
 He's just giving you a gift.

838
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,220
 He wants you to use it.

839
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,500
 He's just saying, "Stop being God.

840
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,020
 Stop being in the center of it all

841
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,140
 and recognize that only I can be God.

842
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,340
 And when I'm God, Jesus would say this in the scriptures,

843
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,980
 "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,

844
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,180
 and I will give you rest and peace,

845
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,540
 and I'll carry the load

846
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,820
 because then I'm in the rightful place."

847
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,100
 And some of us are so overwhelmed right now

848
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,940
 'cause we've forgotten to be still.

849
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,420
 It's a big challenge for us

850
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:16,540
 to replace ourselves in relationship with God.

851
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,660
 Like Emma said in the song earlier,

852
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,780
 to really understand God as our friend,

853
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,140
 to really know that He is our Lord and Savior

854
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,820
 and friend to us.

855
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,860
 It's so difficult for us to make that happen.

856
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,340
 But the benefits of putting Him in that place

857
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,580
 are incredible.

858
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,540
 I wanna show you what Psalm 46 shows us here

859
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,020
 as some of the benefits of knowing who God is.

860
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,300
 It says, "God is our refuge and strength

861
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,900
 whenever we're present in trouble.

862
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,020
 We will not fear, though the earth give away.

863
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,380
 He is with us.

864
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,300
 He is for us."

865
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,420
 It says here that He is like a fortress to us.

866
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,980
 It says, "There are rivers that make streams glad

867
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,820
 in the city of God."

868
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,220
 God is, we see Him now as this new river

869
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,460
 that He's with us on.

870
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,780
 There's all this stuff that's at work in the city

871
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,420
 at work in us that says that He is our provider.

872
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,740
 He is the one who looks after us.

873
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,700
 He is the one who...

874
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,220
 And it all happens 'cause we are to let go.

875
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,980
 So the antidote that Psalm 46 is bringing us to,

876
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,540
 opposed from being God,

877
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,980
 there's this other way of living.

878
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,420
 It's being still.

879
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,180
 And being still also creates this incredible cycle

880
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,020
 in our lives.

881
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,860
 Let me show you.

882
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,460
 So being still, it's about letting go.

883
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,980
 And as we let go of those things

884
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,620
 that we're grasping tightly on, guess what happens?

885
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,860
 We get to know who God is.

886
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,860
 We get to encounter Him.

887
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,700
 Why?

888
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,180
 Because we've stepped out of that place.

889
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,860
 We've put God in the place.

890
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,220
 It's really hard to know God when you're God.

891
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,980
 It's really hard to know God

892
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,860
 when you yourself are trying to be God.

893
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,340
 But as you be still, you let go,

894
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,060
 you put God in the right place, He becomes God again.

895
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,900
 And guess what?

896
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,460
 You then get to know His trust, His security, His help.

897
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,780
 And guess what that does?

898
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,780
 That enables you then to let go of even more stuff.

899
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,660
 'Cause you recognize that He's actually at work.

900
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,060
 He is actually holding you up.

901
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,500
 He is fighting battles for you.

902
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,700
 So you continue to let go and continue to let go.

903
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,700
 And a new cycle is recreated.

904
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,540
 And Psalm 46 is inviting us into that way of life.

905
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,900
 Let me put both of them together.

906
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,140
 And you can take a photo of this if you want,

907
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,420
 if that's your jazz and thing.

908
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,540
 Here's the thing on the left.

909
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,220
 That's what we primarily do in life, I think.

910
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,420
 We are God and we're stressed out.

911
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,500
 And there's this horrible cycle of grasping to one,

912
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,340
 fear and turmoil.

913
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,220
 But Psalm 46 10 says, "Let it go, release the grasp,

914
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,220
 live a different way, be still and know that I am God."

915
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,060
 (sighs)

916
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,020
 That's a good thing.

917
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,740
 It's not quite Scandinavian mountaintops.

918
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,060
 It's so, so much better than that.

919
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,060
 It is being released into the fullness of who God is

920
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,420
 and putting him in the rightful place in our lives.

921
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,700
 I think if God was to rewrite Psalm 46 verse 10,

922
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,140
 he would say this.

923
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,300
 He would say, "Your ability to truly know me as God

924
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,060
 is directly related to your ability

925
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,220
 to let go of pretending to be God."

926
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,740
 Make sense?

927
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,740
 Your ability to truly know me as God

928
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,340
 is directly related to your ability

929
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,300
 to let go of pretending to be God.

930
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,060
 And as you let that go, loosen your grasp,

931
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,220
 you'll find yourself lifting more weight.

932
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,740
 There's one and only one other place

933
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,260
 in the whole of the Bible

934
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,220
 where this phrase, "Be still," is actually found.

935
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,300
 And I wanna read this to you as I close.

936
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,620
 This is found in Mark chapter four, verse 35.

937
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,340
 It says this, "That day when even came,

938
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,380
 he said to the disciples,

939
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,740
 'Let us go over to the other side.'

940
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,620
 Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along

941
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,180
 just as he was in the boat.

942
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,220
 There were also other boats with him.

943
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,460
 A furious squall, a great big storm came up,

944
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,260
 and the waves broke over the boat

945
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,100
 so that it was nearly swamped.

946
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,860
 Jesus was in the stern sleeping on a cushion.

947
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,700
 The disciples, though, were frantically panicking

948
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,780
 and running around and trying to sort it all out."

949
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,980
 The disciples were trying to sort out the storm,

950
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,900
 try to stay alive, trying to work out

951
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,040
 how they can harness the wind,

952
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,660
 how they can keep the boat afloat.

953
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,620
 And they're so freaked out that they wake up Jesus

954
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,420
 and they say, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"

955
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,620
 So Jesus got up, he rebukes the wind,

956
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,740
 and says to the waves, "Quiet, be still."

957
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,500
 Rafa.

958
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,220
 It's the same word with the same emphasis

959
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,700
 and the same passion.

960
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,060
 He speaks to the storm and he says, "Storm, be still."

961
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,020
 And it says, "Immediately, the wind died down

962
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,540
 and was completely calm."

963
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,260
 This is a beautiful metaphor of the reality

964
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,580
 of what our human life is like.

965
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,380
 We're in this boat and storms come against us

966
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,340
 and up and around us.

967
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,860
 And we do our best to try to control the storm,

968
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,740
 try to work it out.

969
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,620
 And as the storm overwhelms us,

970
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,960
 the disciples do the right thing.

971
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,660
 They turn to Jesus and they say, "We cannot do this.

972
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,780
 We are not God.

973
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,940
 We are not equipped for it."

974
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,820
 And Jesus stands up and he says to the raging storm,

975
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,020
 "Be still."

976
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,180
 And it dies down and everything changes.

977
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:21,420
 But what we have to understand is that in Psalm 46,

978
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,620
 it's the same word, but slightly different usage.

979
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,820
 In Psalm 46, the storm is not out there

980
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,420
 in the world somewhere.

981
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,900
 And we're asking Jesus to calm that storm.

982
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,220
 In Psalm 46, we're the storm.

983
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,980
 We're the ones out of control.

984
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,260
 We're the wind that's trying to fight

985
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,820
 against the elements of this world.

986
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,260
 We are God.

987
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:51,020
 And Jesus rebukes us.

988
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,460
 Be still.

989
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,900
 Cease your activity.

990
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,900
 You can't grasp on hard enough.

991
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,540
 So have the courage to let go.

992
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,860
 As we start Psalm 23 next week,

993
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,220
 the Lord is my shepherd.

994
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,580
 I have no ones.

995
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,300
 The question you have to ask yourself today is,

996
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,180
 is that true for you?

997
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,740
 Can we pray?

998
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,380
 Let's pray.

999
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:28,020
 Father, we come before you now as your people.

1000
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:32,740
 We come before you knowing this story,

1001
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,700
 the raging storm that is found inside of us.

1002
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,300
 We come to you understanding our propensity

1003
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,980
 to try to control our lives.

1004
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:48,420
 We come to you understanding that we have the tendency

1005
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,340
 to take control of the things that are out of control.

1006
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,260
 That we try to control the things

1007
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,900
 that we weren't actually even designed to control.

1008
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:03,580
 We try to do everything we can to make our future perfect,

1009
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,340
 when in reality we cannot even begin to impact

1010
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,340
 or shape what it is that's gonna happen next.

1011
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:16,420
 Father, I wanna pray today for those

1012
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,380
 where this message is really important.

1013
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,500
 (gentle music)

1014
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,340
 Lord, for those of us who are sitting here today

1015
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,860
 and we know the being God cycle,

1016
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:30,460
 where we know we're at war with ourselves

1017
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,660
 and others around us,

1018
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,620
 where we know that we've been trying to get control

1019
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,900
 of an uncontrollable situation

1020
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,860
 so much that it's stressing us out

1021
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,700
 and we're grasping a hold of it.

1022
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:47,300
 Father, I wanna pray today for those that recognize

1023
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,500
 that Jesus is commanding their storm to be still today.

1024
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,860
 And whether you're online or in this room right now,

1025
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,020
 just whilst our eyes are closed,

1026
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,980
 in a moment I'm gonna invite you if this is for you.

1027
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,180
 It won't be for everybody perhaps,

1028
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,020
 but if this is speaking to you today,

1029
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,660
 if you know that that command of being still

1030
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,180
 is needed in your life today,

1031
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,980
 in a moment I'm gonna invite you to stand

1032
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,860
 whether you're online or in this room,

1033
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,940
 you can stand if you're online.

1034
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,060
 I wanna invite you to stand and to do so,

1035
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:22,380
 it's a prophetic act because this is about the courage

1036
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,300
 to let go,

1037
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,020
 the courage to say, I've had enough,

1038
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,260
 the courage to say, I've tried to be God

1039
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,660
 and I'm exhausted and overwhelmed

1040
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,020
 and I need to be still again.

1041
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:42,380
 And so for us in this room, for those online right now,

1042
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,740
 if you would like me to pray for you

1043
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,380
 about that specific thing,

1044
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,500
 if this is something that's working in your heart right now,

1045
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,420
 I wanna invite you just, we're not gonna look around,

1046
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,700
 I'm just gonna invite you to stand,

1047
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,060
 you're standing in faith right now.

1048
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,620
 And you standing as a way of saying,

1049
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,260
 this is for me right here in this moment,

1050
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,980
 I need to let go.

1051
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,220
 There's a part of my life where I'm holding on

1052
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,900
 and it's too much and it's overwhelming me

1053
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,940
 and I need to let go.

1054
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,980
 Holy Spirit, would you come now

1055
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,420
 for everybody online and in this room in this moment

1056
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,980
 who are standing before you.

1057
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,300
 If you're standing, I just wanna encourage you

1058
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,460
 to open your hands.

1059
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,620
 And there's a storm that's raging around inside of you.

1060
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,980
 You're living in an uncontrollable world.

1061
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,460
 You can't control everything.

1062
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,540
 But the good news is God doesn't expect you

1063
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,900
 to control everything.

1064
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,220
 He doesn't ask you to control everything

1065
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,300
 and letting go of control is freaky for many of us.

1066
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,940
 If you're a control freak like me,

1067
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,260
 this is a word and season.

1068
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,380
 It's hard to let go.

1069
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:53,820
 But as you hold on, you will know God less.

1070
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,980
 And God's heart towards you today is I want you to know me.

1071
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,180
 I want you to know my trust and my security

1072
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,460
 and my provision and my power.

1073
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,820
 I want you to truly understand who I am.

1074
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:11,820
 Would you Rafa, would you cease the striving

1075
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,540
 and know that I am your God?

1076
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:20,900
 Father, I pray for a release right now

1077
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,500
 by the power of your spirit

1078
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,620
 of every person standing before you.

1079
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:30,240
 Father, they're standing with that honesty of saying,

1080
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,740
 I'm sorry, Lord.

1081
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:36,740
 And although there's no condemnation,

1082
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:43,420
 this phrase far from that cheesy picture

1083
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,220
 we put around it is a command.

1084
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,540
 It's a strong word to us.

1085
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,740
 Father, as we learn what it is to put you

1086
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,840
 in the rightful place again in our hearts.

1087
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,020
 Father, I know that all the benefits are coming.

1088
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,100
 Lord, I know the peace and the beauty and the security

1089
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,300
 and the hope and the love

1090
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,700
 and the reconciliation of relationships

1091
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,020
 and the things that the Holy Spirit wants to do.

1092
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:09,940
 It is yours.

1093
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,080
 God has got so much goodness.

1094
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,820
 When you put him as first in your life,

1095
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,900
 there's such an abundance of his care.

1096
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,940
 So Lord, come.

1097
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:28,960
 Take a moment just to receive his glory,

1098
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,300
 to be in awe of his goodness.

1099
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:37,220
 Him in the rightful place is the place of shalom.

1100
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,720
 It's what the scriptures cry out for constantly.

1101
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,060
 (gentle music)

1102
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,260
 And wouldn't it be amazing

1103
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,940
 if we could be a restful presence in an anxious world?

1104
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:53,580
 If we could be the very ones that people turn to

1105
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,060
 and say, "How do you have such peace?"

1106
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:02,900
 And you reply, "It's not 'cause I got all the answers.

1107
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,260
 It's not 'cause my bank account's secure.

1108
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,420
 It's not because everything's perfect in my life.

1109
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,220
 It's because I realize I'm not God."

1110
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,360
 And I have a God.

1111
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,760
 I have a shepherd.

1112
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,260
 And I have this one that I get to follow for my whole life.

1113
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,720
 And it is so good.

1114
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,160
 Would you come on Alpha?

1115
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,560
 Would you come and taste and know that this Lord is good?

1116
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,020
 I just wanna pray for you just to continue to receive.

1117
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,000
 We're gonna go into a time

1118
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,900
 of just receiving from him in worship.

1119
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,700
 I know we've gone a little bit longer,

1120
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,340
 but I don't want you to rush out of this moment.

1121
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,140
 You don't need to rush at the end of this service.

1122
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,040
 Lunch can wait.

1123
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,820
 This is important work.

1124
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,440
 It's important spiritual work for you today.

1125
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,860
 Just allow the Holy Spirit to do that

1126
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,060
 as we worship over you,

1127
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,500
 as you allow the Spirit of God to worship over you.

1128
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,120
 Find him again in that beautiful place of him as your Lord.

1129
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,700
 (gentle music)

1130
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,280
 (gentle music)
