1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
 When she was talking about having passion and all of that,

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,240
 I really admire her passion for workout as well.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,200
 She loves exercise and she would, you know, go on workouts.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,840
 While I struggle to go on workout once every three months,

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,520
 I join the gym next door.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,200
 But I have promised myself that I will go after VBS.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,440
 And then my next statement was,

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,080
 I'll go after I preach this Sunday.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,280
 Hopefully tomorrow I'll bring you good news that I will go.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,120
 Right?

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,920
 I don't have the motivation to get changed into my work

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,320
 workout clothes.

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,600
 And I really need that empowerment,

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,520
 that motivation, as you can say.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,040
 And I think that when I,

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,240
 and reminds me of my younger days,

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,680
 when I was studying in university,

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,800
 I joined a Christian choir and it was one of the wildest

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,680
 thing I've ever done up to that point in my life.

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
 And you go, Christian choir?

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,640
 Wild?

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,000
 How they go together?

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,960
 But if you mix in a bunch of 20 year olds,

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,600
 it's a whole different story.

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,520
 There was this year when I first joined the committee

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,120
 of that Christian choir,

27
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,680
 and I was tasked to do a musical for,

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,240
 not only for that university,

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,400
 I was in Baptist university, right?

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,000
 Not only for the university Baptist choir,

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,200
 we had to join another university's Christian choir

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,920
 to do something together, to put on a musical together.

33
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,280
 Well, doing a musical on its own is really hard

34
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,000
 because all the garments, all the props,

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,680
 look at this, all the choreography, everything.

36
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,320
 You can actually see me there,

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,680
 but I hope that you don't see me

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,200
 'cause I look really different.

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,560
 Everything, you have to do it from scratch.

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,040
 And not only that, I have to work with another university.

41
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,640
 What about the scheduling?

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,000
 What about the cohesion, you know,

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,160
 the communication between the two conductors?

44
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,360
 What are the dynamics like?

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,960
 And if you still think this is still tame, listen,

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,720
 I have to do this without WhatsApp.

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,440
 There's no WhatsApp group, there's no AI, there's nothing.

48
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,200
 Okay, so I often tell my K4C class, I'm really old,

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,360
 I'm like 84, because I remember the first year

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,360
 I was in university, I'm really embarrassed to say this,

51
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,080
 I have to hand in my homework through a floppy disk.

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,400
 For those of you that don't know what a floppy disk is,

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
 it is that little icon on the Word document

54
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,600
 where you wanna push save,

55
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,720
 and you see this weird square, right?

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,360
 That weird square was a floppy disk.

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
 It was from the ancient day, and I have to,

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,800
 you can only save around two to three documents

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,200
 in a floppy disk.

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,560
 So it was really fun.

61
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,400
 It was fun to have, you know,

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,560
 a production using just word of mouth,

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,920
 just call, just trust that person.

64
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,480
 When I schedule something, you will be there.

65
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,200
 I couldn't double confirm you through my WhatsApp, right?

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,520
 If you don't show up, I don't know how to contact you.

67
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,800
 And I so vividly remember how overwhelmed I was

68
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,280
 when in the meeting,

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,160
 when I was tasked with this responsibility.

70
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,120
 How could I possibly handle everything?

71
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,040
 It was my first time being in a committee member,

72
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,360
 and now you're telling me that I need to run

73
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,120
 this whole thing.

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,000
 They have chosen the wrong person.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,280
 They have made a huge mistake.

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,440
 But that's the thing.

77
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,640
 Jesus gives every one of his volunteer a task

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,880
 that can feel just like that daunting sometimes.

79
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,040
 In Acts 1.8, right before Jesus ascended to heaven,

80
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
 Jesus said, "You will receive power

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,480
 "when the Holy Spirit come on you,

82
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,440
 "and you will be my witness in Jerusalem,

83
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,480
 "and in all Judea and Samaria,

84
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,000
 "and to the ends of the world."

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,520
 Can you imagine how overwhelming it is

86
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,480
 for the first disciples?

87
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,640
 The small, ordinary group of men and women

88
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,000
 were told to bring the message of Jesus to the whole world.

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,840
 No social media, no microphones, no Bible app,

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,840
 just their voices, their stories,

91
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,480
 and the promise of God's power.

92
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,640
 And honestly, that could feel overwhelming for us too.

93
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,640
 For many of us, it's not easy or natural

94
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
 to talk about our faith,

95
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,320
 especially with people close to us.

96
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,480
 Maybe you feel nervous to bring up Jesus in your family

97
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,800
 because you don't wanna cause tension

98
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,680
 or to be misunderstood.

99
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,240
 Maybe you feel awkward sharing your faith with friends,

100
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,960
 worrying that what they will think about you,

101
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,400
 maybe they think that you're very pushy, maybe at work.

102
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,040
 You wonder if it's even possible or wise

103
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,680
 to share what you believe.

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,800
 Our series of Uncharted

105
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,520
 led us to examine the unchartedness of our early churches

106
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,200
 and the season our church is in.

107
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,880
 Just like those first believers,

108
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,440
 we are finding ourselves stepping into territory

109
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,400
 we have never been before,

110
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,800
 facing new challenges, new opportunities,

111
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,560
 and sometimes new fears.

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,000
 The early churches didn't have a step-by-step manual

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,040
 for what to do next.

114
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,720
 They were called to trust God

115
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,640
 and they have to follow the Spirit's leading

116
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,080
 and to share the message of Jesus in places and ways

117
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,160
 that was unfamiliar and even risky.

118
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,480
 In the same way as a church family,

119
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,640
 we are navigating our own uncharted waters.

120
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,000
 Maybe we're starting a new ministry,

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,400
 reaching out to new people,

122
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,360
 or simply learning to trust God in our journey.

123
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,160
 In situations where we feel uncertain or overwhelming,

124
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,280
 just like the early disciples,

125
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,840
 we might feel small, unprepared,

126
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,880
 unsure of how to move forward.

127
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,400
 But the good news is we are not alone.

128
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,440
 In the first week, our elder Deborah shared with us

129
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,320
 about what it means to wait in active faith.

130
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,520
 Waiting isn't just about sitting around doing nothing.

131
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,720
 It's a posture of hope and expectation.

132
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,240
 The early believers didn't wait passively.

133
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,800
 They trusted in Jesus' promise and the Holy Spirit

134
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,480
 and their waiting was filled with purpose.

135
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,400
 And then last week,

136
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,680
 Pastor John spoke about what it means to,

137
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
 to remember the word, receive, thank you,

138
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,760
 to what it means to receive.

139
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,080
 The waiting was finally over.

140
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,960
 Through Christ, God sent us the Holy Spirit,

141
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,560
 not just to gather in the upper room,

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,920
 but as a gift for everyone,

143
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,280
 men and women, young and old,

144
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
 people from every nation.

145
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,240
 It's a gift for all.

146
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,240
 And today, we're gonna talk about what it means

147
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,840
 to be empowered by the Holy Spirit.

148
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,560
 As the theologian, Gordon Fee, has said,

149
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,800
 "The gift of the Spirit is not given

150
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,600
 "so that believers may enjoy

151
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,560
 "a private spiritual experience,

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,200
 "but so that they may participate

153
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,600
 "in the life and mission of the church

154
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,200
 "as the new people of God."

155
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,120
 There is a purpose and mission behind this gift.

156
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,720
 There is a purpose and mission behind this gift.

157
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,120
 The Holy Spirit empowers us

158
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,080
 for what God is calling us to do.

159
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,600
 We're not left alone to face this daunting task.

160
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,080
 We are empowered together by the Spirit

161
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,600
 to live out God's mission in the world.

162
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,600
 But what is our mission?

163
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,880
 As Acts 1.8 says, before Jesus ascended to heaven,

164
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,320
 He said, "You will, we will be His witness in Jerusalem

165
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
 "and in all Judea and Samaria,

166
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,640
 "and to the ends of the world."

167
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,080
 It was clear that the mission to the disciples

168
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,400
 was to be Christ's witnesses,

169
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,800
 not just in Jerusalem, but till the end of the world.

170
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,840
 But this mission wasn't just for them back then.

171
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,040
 It was for us too.

172
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,280
 We are called to be Christ's witness today

173
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,600
 in our home, in our workplaces.

174
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,520
 But what is a mission?

175
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,240
 What does being a witness mean?

176
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,400
 When I was younger, I attended a local church

177
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,040
 where every few months, all the community groups,

178
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,080
 everyone would go out to hand out gospel tracts.

179
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,840
 Do you know what are gospel tracts?

180
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,200
 There they are.

181
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,680
 They are small pamphlets that explain what the gospel is,

182
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,520
 usually with a simple story.

183
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,640
 It's very in your face, right?

184
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,920
 They explain what the gospel is,

185
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,520
 usually with a short story or Bible verse.

186
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,440
 We would stand around the parks and bus stops

187
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,240
 and wait for people.

188
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,440
 Imagine that you were given out a bunch of these

189
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,920
 and you have to stand around bus stops.

190
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,720
 And then when the people get off the bus

191
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,320
 from work or whatever, we have to go,

192
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,480
 "Hi, I'm June.

193
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,760
 "I'm one of the Christians around this area.

194
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,880
 "Have you heard of Jesus yet?"

195
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,880
 That, to an introvert, is so cringey

196
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,240
 that every time they made me go,

197
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,720
 I'll be like, "I don't feel well today.

198
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,240
 "I cannot go today.

199
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,680
 "This is going to be so cringey

200
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,840
 "if I have to walk up to someone sitting,

201
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,800
 "enjoying their sunny afternoon."

202
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,040
 And I go, "Hi."

203
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,800
 So creepy.

204
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,640
 But when I told my pastors back then,

205
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,280
 she would say, "Oh, but you should not be ashamed

206
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,160
 "of the gospel.

207
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,240
 "You need to be the witness."

208
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,120
 Is that what being a witness is?

209
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,080
 I wonder at that time.

210
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,360
 Later, during my university years,

211
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,440
 the pressure looked a little different.

212
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,960
 Remember, I was organizing the musical in my second year?

213
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,400
 I was also motivated by my peers,

214
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,040
 not by my parents, by my classmates,

215
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,560
 to have a high GPA.

216
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
 That means like the annual average score

217
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,400
 for that year, right?

218
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,000
 And because that is the way to be a good witness

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 to my friends and family.

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,720
 Do you know what my GPA was

221
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,920
 in the first year, first semester?

222
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,520
 Generally, people get 3.5

223
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,440
 because it is the easiest semester

224
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,400
 and everyone wants to get a high one

225
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,040
 so that by the end of the third year,

226
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,160
 they have something to sit on, right?

227
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,320
 Everyone gets around 3.5 or something.

228
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,760
 I also got a three.

229
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,160
 I got a 2.3.

230
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,200
 That was really, really bad.

231
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,800
 Honestly, and so,

232
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,840
 but the pressure motivates me.

233
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,640
 Not only the pressure motivates me,

234
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880
 I actually have a friend, my classmate,

235
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,800
 who's also my dormitory flatmate.

236
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,680
 She would get up at five o'clock

237
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,280
 in the morning to study.

238
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,200
 As a university student,

239
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,560
 I didn't get up at five.

240
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,960
 I tried to, but that motivate me.

241
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,520
 So actually, I raised my GPA

242
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,960
 from 2.3 to 3.1.

243
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,160
 And over that time,

244
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,360
 I realized that I was reducing

245
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,760
 to being a witness,

246
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,080
 to just having good behaviors

247
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,160
 or impressive achievements.

248
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,320
 That mindset brought a lot of pressure.

249
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,640
 I felt like I constantly had to live up

250
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,840
 to some perfect Christian standards.

251
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,600
 And when I inevitably fall short,

252
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,560
 it left me with a sense of shame and guilt.

253
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,520
 But the most difficult place to be a witness,

254
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,720
 for me, has always been at home.

255
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,880
 My parents, more than anyone, know my flaws.

256
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,560
 My laziness, my procrastination,

257
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,440
 and those rebellious moments.

258
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,240
 Trying to be witness in my own family

259
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,040
 has often felt impossible

260
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,960
 because they see the real me

261
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,880
 and not the church me.

262
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
 If I'm honest,

263
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,080
 sharing my faith at home

264
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,480
 is the most difficult.

265
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,000
 So what is being a witness?

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
 In the ancient world,

267
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,720
 a herald was a messenger

268
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,640
 sent from the battlefield.

269
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,760
 Imagine a city full of anxious people

270
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,560
 waiting to hear who had won the war.

271
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,160
 And then the herald finally arrived

272
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,840
 and shouted the good news,

273
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,280
 the victory, to these people

274
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,600
 and everything changed.

275
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,720
 The whole city rejoiced.

276
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,240
 The future looked different.

277
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,040
 The Greek word for this word,

278
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,200
 this joyful announcement,

279
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,240
 is called euangelion.

280
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
 The same word we use for gospel

281
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
 or the good news.

282
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,640
 This is the picture

283
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,600
 that the first Christian used

284
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,160
 when they talked about Jesus.

285
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,200
 They believed that through his death

286
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,480
 and resurrection,

287
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,320
 Jesus had already won

288
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,640
 the ultimate victory

289
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,360
 over sin, death, and evil.

290
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,600
 The victory is real.

291
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,120
 It has already happened.

292
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,480
 But just like history,

293
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,400
 imagine World War II, right?

294
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,840
 For example,

295
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,920
 even after the enemy

296
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,280
 was defeated in their homeland,

297
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,720
 many places still lived under occupation.

298
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,200
 The news of the victory has arrived,

299
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
 but the effects hadn't reached

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
 every corner yet.

301
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
 People in those places

302
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,320
 lived in the in-betweens.

303
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
 They knew victory was won,

304
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,680
 but the old powers

305
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,040
 were still in the present for a time.

306
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,000
 And that's the world we live in.

307
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,520
 That's the world we live in.

308
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,000
 We've heard the good news

309
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,080
 that Jesus has won,

310
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,120
 but we still live and experience pain,

311
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,280
 suffering, and injustice.

312
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,080
 The effects of his victory

313
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,120
 are not fully here yet.

314
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,920
 We live in this tension,

315
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,480
 this already but not yet tension.

316
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,960
 So what does it mean

317
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,200
 to be a witness in Christ?

318
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
 It means being like the herald

319
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,320
 who brings the news of victory.

320
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,760
 It means living, speaking,

321
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,640
 and making choices in ways

322
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,000
 that show people

323
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,920
 Jesus has already won.

324
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,040
 Even while we wait for the fullness

325
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,920
 of his victory to come,

326
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,680
 our lives become signals to the world

327
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,680
 that a new reality has begun.

328
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,720
 Even in a world that hasn't yet seen

329
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,680
 the final peace,

330
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,240
 we live as a people

331
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,960
 who know that the outcome is secure.

332
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,840
 And how can we do something

333
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,280
 that seems impossible?

334
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,840
 That seems impossible, right?

335
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,640
 We are living in this injustice.

336
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,880
 We're experiencing pain and suffering,

337
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,760
 and we have to show people that,

338
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,080
 no, the victory is done.

339
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,040
 We are set free from our sin.

340
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,880
 We are set free from our pain.

341
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,960
 There can be justice in this place,

342
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,840
 but I don't see it yet.

343
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,560
 Nor my friends have seen it yet,

344
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,440
 but I have to live and speak

345
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,360
 and make decisions and choose

346
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,400
 as if the final victory

347
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,480
 is here already.

348
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,640
 How can we do something

349
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,800
 that seems near impossible?

350
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
 But before the commission,

351
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,080
 there was the promise.

352
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,000
 You will receive power

353
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,280
 when the Holy Spirit comes on you.

354
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,640
 You will receive power.

355
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,080
 We are empowered by the Holy Spirit

356
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,680
 to live out this command.

357
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,800
 We're not doing this

358
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,320
 out of our own strength,

359
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,240
 nor we should be.

360
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,520
 We have access to the Holy Spirit,

361
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,040
 who is our ever-present help.

362
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,000
 We are empowered.

363
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,040
 Peter's life and his sermon

364
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,360
 after Pentecost is a demonstration

365
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,800
 of how the Spirit empowers us

366
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,520
 for this mission.

367
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,800
 Just look at, can you recall

368
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,200
 some of what Peter has gone through

369
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,280
 before the Pentecost,

370
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,960
 before Jesus died?

371
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,480
 He boldly walked on water

372
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,560
 for a moment,

373
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,280
 and then sank in fear.

374
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,360
 He tried to defend Jesus

375
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,320
 by cutting off soldiers' ear,

376
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,160
 acting impulsively.

377
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,800
 Most painfully,

378
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,960
 he denied even knowing Jesus

379
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,800
 three times.

380
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,880
 In all of these moments,

381
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,040
 Peter's action was driven

382
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,160
 by what you called

383
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,800
 self-reliance zeal.

384
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,480
 This means that he was relying

385
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,800
 mostly on his own energy,

386
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,360
 his own ideas of what should be done,

387
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,800
 and his own desire

388
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,640
 to prove his loyalty to Jesus.

389
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,920
 It was courage fueled

390
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,720
 by his own effort,

391
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,080
 by trying harder,

392
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,240
 by pushing forward,

393
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,840
 by reacting in the moment.

394
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,600
 But no matter how sincere he was,

395
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,000
 it wasn't enough.

396
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,240
 His courage kept running out

397
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,640
 when the pressure was on.

398
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,320
 Peter was passionate.

399
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,160
 He wanted to be faithful,

400
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,440
 but over and over again,

401
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,760
 he found himself falling short,

402
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,840
 sinking, falling,

403
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,480
 acting out of fear or confusion.

404
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
 He was just like us,

405
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,320
 full of good intention,

406
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
 but often lacking the strength

407
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,040
 to follow through.

408
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,120
 Don't know if you've ever felt that way.

409
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,880
 We wanted to do something good

410
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,160
 for people, to serve them,

411
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,800
 but accidentally,

412
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,200
 not of our own choosing.

413
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,960
 We hurt them by forcing our thoughts

414
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,440
 and ideas over them,

415
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,640
 by questioning them too hard.

416
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,720
 That was absolutely me.

417
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,880
 When I was younger,

418
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,400
 in my university year,

419
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,040
 I had a friend who is like Eeyore

420
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,880
 in Winnie the Pooh.

421
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,040
 I know, I know.

422
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,000
 I feel so sorry for him too.

423
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,480
 Like, he is a Christian.

424
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,760
 We have been together in the church

425
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,960
 for many years,

426
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,160
 and he would come and say,

427
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,480
 "Hi."

428
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,800
 And I go,

429
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,520
 "What do you like?

430
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,600
 You know, you don't have to."

431
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,520
 Also, he served in church a lot.

432
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,840
 He is in the production team.

433
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,520
 He also lead worship.

434
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,200
 He also do a lot of stuff,

435
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,000
 but he just felt so broken

436
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,960
 and so tired all the time,

437
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,400
 and nothing brings him joy.

438
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,120
 In my heart, I really want him

439
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,520
 to be joyful.

440
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,040
 I believe that as you're a Christian,

441
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,760
 you should be,

442
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,160
 you can be joyful.

443
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,360
 This is the life that Jesus

444
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,280
 has given to us.

445
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,960
 That was my intention.

446
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,560
 But at the end of the day,

447
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,440
 he go, "June, can you not ask me

448
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,680
 any more questions?

449
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,080
 Can you just stay away from me

450
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,760
 for a while?

451
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,440
 You are pushing me too hard."

452
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,880
 And I realized that no matter

453
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,760
 how good my intention is,

454
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,280
 I was hurting him.

455
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,800
 I was pushing my idea

456
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,840
 of what a Christian look like

457
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,760
 onto him.

458
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,160
 It was good intention,

459
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,760
 but falling short.

460
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,000
 But then we see Peter

461
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,400
 after Pentecost.

462
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,640
 In Acts 2.25,

463
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,640
 we see that Peter was not alone.

464
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,320
 He was filled with the Holy Spirit.

465
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,560
 Peter stands in front

466
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,800
 of a huge crowd

467
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,240
 and preached by citing Psalm 16.

468
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,040
 He says,

469
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,600
 "David said about him,

470
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,800
 'I saw the Lord was always

471
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,720
 before me,

472
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,920
 because he is at my right hand.

473
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,680
 I will not be shaken.

474
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,160
 Therefore, my heart is glad

475
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
 and my tongue rejoices.

476
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,560
 My body will also rest in hope,

477
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,200
 because you will not abandon me

478
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,760
 to the realm of the dead.

479
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,640
 You will not let your Holy One

480
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,320
 see decay.'"

481
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,640
 Here is what Peter is doing.

482
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,840
 He's looking back at what

483
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,600
 King David wrote in the Psalms,

484
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,280
 and he realized David

485
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,920
 wasn't just talking about himself.

486
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,160
 David was pointing forward

487
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,080
 to someone greater,

488
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,920
 the true Holy One,

489
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,440
 who would not stay dead,

490
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,280
 who would rise again.

491
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,160
 Peter saw that Jesus

492
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,560
 is the only one that truly fits

493
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,920
 what David describes.

494
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,880
 Jesus is the Holy One

495
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,640
 who died but did not see decay,

496
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,240
 because God raised him

497
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,960
 from the dead.

498
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,600
 Peter's sermon at Pentecost

499
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,240
 wasn't about condemning

500
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,680
 or passing judgment,

501
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
 telling them off that,

502
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,520
 "You should have known

503
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,120
 the Bible said so clearly."

504
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,480
 He wasn't judging them

505
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,960
 for not knowing.

506
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,680
 No, Peter was one of them.

507
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,080
 He was a Jew who had grown up

508
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,240
 with the same hopes

509
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,600
 and same dreams,

510
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,000
 waiting for God's promise

511
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,960
 to be fulfilled.

512
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,520
 Just like everyone who listens

513
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,760
 to him that day,

514
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,320
 Peter had wondered,

515
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,720
 "When will the Messiah come?

516
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,240
 Who is going to fulfill

517
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,640
 all that God promised

518
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,120
 to King David?"

519
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,480
 His heart was full

520
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,240
 of the same longing,

521
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,760
 the same question

522
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,480
 as the people gathered around him.

523
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,680
 But now,

524
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,960
 filled with the Holy Spirit,

525
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,680
 Peter boldly announces

526
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,480
 that the answer to those hopes

527
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,240
 and those dreams is Jesus,

528
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,000
 the Son of God,

529
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,760
 the true descendant of David,

530
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,560
 and the long-awaited Messiah.

531
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,720
 Peter's message

532
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,120
 was deeply personal.

533
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,640
 He wasn't delivering

534
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,560
 cold theology.

535
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,920
 He was sharing

536
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,720
 the fulfillment

537
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,840
 of his people's greatest hope.

538
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,720
 He stood not as an outsider,

539
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,280
 but a fellow seeker

540
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,360
 whose eyes had been opened

541
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,160
 by God's grace.

542
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,960
 This is what it means

543
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,480
 to be a witness.

544
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,600
 To be a witness

545
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,080
 is not simply to declare facts

546
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,360
 or argue people into believing.

547
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,160
 It is much more than that.

548
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,360
 Being a witness,

549
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,680
 as Peter shows us,

550
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,640
 means stepping into the world

551
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,680
 of the people we are speaking to,

552
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,240
 understanding their fears,

553
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,200
 their hopes,

554
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
 and their deepest question.

555
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,640
 It means that allowing

556
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,520
 the Holy Spirit to fill us

557
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,280
 so that our words come out

558
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,200
 not from pride or distance,

559
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,320
 but from genuine compassion

560
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,080
 and shared humanity.

561
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,280
 For us today,

562
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,720
 being witness of Jesus

563
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,680
 is more than just sharing a message.

564
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,120
 It is about living it out.

565
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
 It looks like really listening

566
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,680
 to the people around us,

567
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,840
 our friends, our colleagues,

568
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,040
 our classmates,

569
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
 getting to know their stories

570
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,320
 and looking for ways

571
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,600
 to connect them,

572
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,760
 their questions and struggles

573
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,040
 to the hope we have found in Jesus.

574
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,480
 It is living with humility

575
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,920
 and being real.

576
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,200
 It's not about acting

577
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,120
 as we have got it all together

578
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,680
 or that we're better than others

579
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,920
 so that we can tell you

580
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,200
 about who Jesus is,

581
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,960
 but being honest

582
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,360
 as people who have found hope

583
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,320
 and healing in Jesus

584
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,760
 and want to share that with others.

585
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,520
 Peter was not alone.

586
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,320
 The Holy Spirit empowered Peter

587
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,000
 to see the hearts of the people,

588
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,400
 to see the hearts of what the people need

589
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,920
 so that he could give them

590
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,880
 the hope that they need.

591
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,760
 We are empowered by the Holy Spirit

592
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,240
 to do the same.

593
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,120
 When our colleagues annoyed us,

594
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,480
 you have a colleague in mind,

595
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,200
 when our colleagues annoyed us,

596
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,800
 instead of our usual frustration,

597
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,280
 we're empowered by the Holy Spirit

598
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,960
 to understand.

599
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,680
 It doesn't mean that we have to go suffer

600
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,000
 and go, "Yeah, you annoyed us.

601
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Let me just suffer."

602
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,160
 But we are empowered

603
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,720
 by the Holy Spirit to understand.

604
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,960
 When our friends shared

605
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,400
 about their problems,

606
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,520
 we are empowered by the Holy Spirit

607
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,360
 to direct them to the hope

608
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,040
 that Jesus has for him or her.

609
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,280
 What is really amazing about Peter

610
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,440
 is that he was just

611
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,280
 an ordinary fisherman.

612
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,360
 He wasn't known for being

613
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,480
 a great speaker.

614
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,520
 In fact, before Pentecost,

615
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,640
 Peter was often impulsive.

616
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,920
 He made a lot of mistakes,

617
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
 and sometimes he was even scared

618
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,040
 to admit that he knew Jesus.

619
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,000
 But once the Holy Spirit came,

620
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,640
 everything changed.

621
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
 The same is true for us.

622
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,080
 We may feel inadequate, unqualified,

623
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,200
 or unsure of what to say.

624
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,280
 Yet, this is not in our own strength

625
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,400
 or eloquence that matters.

626
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,560
 Whether we are making

627
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,360
 godly decisions at work,

628
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,760
 befriending someone who feels

629
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,080
 left out at school,

630
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,200
 or choosing to communicate

631
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,680
 with love and patience at home,

632
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,320
 these are all visible expressions

633
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,280
 of our inner conviction

634
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,920
 that Jesus reigns.

635
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,760
 Each act of faith,

636
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,440
 each moment of kindness,

637
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,560
 reflects our trust

638
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,600
 that Jesus has already won

639
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,200
 and victory over sin

640
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,000
 and that by His Spirit,

641
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,480
 we can live differently.

642
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,840
 It is not out of our own strength

643
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,320
 that we can go and force

644
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,560
 ourselves to be kind

645
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,000
 and force ourselves to do more.

646
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 It is the Holy Spirit

647
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,080
 that is with us

648
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,200
 so that we're able to understand

649
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,720
 and we want to choose

650
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,120
 to live differently

651
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,960
 because we are empowered

652
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,120
 by the Holy Spirit.

653
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,720
 Moreover, Peter's courage

654
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,480
 wasn't something he drummed up

655
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,160
 from within himself.

656
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,400
 He didn't suddenly become eloquent

657
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,840
 because he tried harder

658
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,200
 or studied more.

659
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,000
 Instead, the Spirit filled him,

660
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,200
 gave him the words,

661
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,880
 and gave him the insight

662
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,200
 from God's Word.

663
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,360
 So much so that when he spoke,

664
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,360
 his message could cut straight

665
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,040
 to the hearts of the listener.

666
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,160
 The Spirit empowered Peter

667
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,440
 to be bold through his revelation

668
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,560
 in his word.

669
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,280
 Look at Acts 2, 22-23.

670
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,720
 Fellow Israelites, listen to this.

671
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,680
 Jesus of Nazareth

672
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,680
 was a man accredited by God

673
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,960
 to you by miracles,

674
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,600
 wonders, and signs,

675
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,880
 which God did among you through him.

676
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,120
 As you yourself know,

677
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,080
 this man was handed over to you

678
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
 by God's deliberate plan

679
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,480
 and foreknowledge,

680
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,120
 and you, with the help of wicked men,

681
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
 put him to death

682
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,520
 by nailing him to the cross.

683
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,760
 In just a few words,

684
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,840
 Peter brings together two big truths

685
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,240
 about the cross,

686
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,720
 truths that are both comforting

687
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,480
 and challenging.

688
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,560
 First, Peter wants everyone to know

689
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,160
 that Jesus' death was not a plan B.

690
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,120
 It was not an accident.

691
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,160
 The cross, like things,

692
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,640
 it's not like things got out of control

693
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,920
 or maybe it's God's original plan backfired

694
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,640
 so he had to come up with a backup.

695
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,240
 No, it may look that way,

696
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,080
 may look that way,

697
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,120
 especially when you see Jesus being betrayed,

698
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,680
 arrested, and nailed to a cross.

699
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,880
 From the outside,

700
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,560
 it might seem like everything went wrong,

701
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,120
 like evil and chaos won that day.

702
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,880
 But Peter made it clear,

703
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,440
 this was never plan B.

704
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,400
 Jesus' death was not a surprise to God

705
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,760
 or a mistake in the story.

706
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,760
 Peter says Jesus was handed over

707
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,040
 by God's deliberate plan

708
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,560
 and foreknowledge.

709
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,920
 That means God already know exactly

710
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,160
 what he was doing all along.

711
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,800
 The cross wasn't God's scrambling fix to a problem.

712
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,600
 It was always the plan to save us.

713
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,320
 What looked like the defeat

714
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,520
 was actually God working out his greatest victory,

715
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,280
 even in the darkest moment.

716
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,880
 God was in control,

717
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,000
 turning the very thing that would have,

718
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
 turning it into the very thing

719
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
 that would have rescued us.

720
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,760
 But Peter wouldn't let the crowd off the hook.

721
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,040
 He said, "And you,

722
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,960
 "with the help of the wicked man,

723
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,400
 "put him to death."

724
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,680
 So yes, it was God's plan,

725
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,400
 but it was also human sin

726
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,160
 that nailed Jesus to the cross.

727
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,440
 It was jealousy, fear,

728
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,760
 rejection that led to his crucifixion.

729
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,440
 The religious leaders schemed,

730
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,680
 the crowd shouted,

731
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,000
 the Roman soldiers carried it out.

732
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,600
 And yet, even though God used their actions for good,

733
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,120
 they were still responsible for what they did.

734
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,120
 God's plan doesn't excuse our guilt.

735
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,640
 God's sovereignty and our responsibility go hand in hand,

736
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,760
 and we can't always explain how that works,

737
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,560
 but both are true.

738
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,440
 Now, here's where the Holy Spirit comes in.

739
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,080
 As Peter is preaching,

740
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,840
 it is not just a history lesson or theology lecture.

741
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,040
 The Holy Spirit is at work.

742
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,200
 His empowerment is at work,

743
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,560
 taking those words and pressing them

744
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,760
 right into people's hearts.

745
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,960
 In Acts 2, 37, it says,

746
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,840
 "When the people heard this,

747
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,640
 "they were cut to the heart."

748
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,640
 It was not just about knowing it was my responsibility.

749
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,560
 It was something that actually were impressed in their heart,

750
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,240
 and they felt for it, they felt about it.

751
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,760
 They have a feeling to it,

752
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,280
 and that's what the Spirit does.

753
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,560
 He brings clarity into,

754
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,480
 clarity about who Jesus is,

755
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,480
 and conviction about where we stand with God.

756
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,200
 It's like the lights come on,

757
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,360
 and suddenly it's personal.

758
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,760
 The crowd didn't just understand the message,

759
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,880
 they felt it.

760
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,640
 They realized that the need for Jesus,

761
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,480
 and cried out, "Brothers, what shall we do?"

762
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,160
 It was this moment of the Holy Spirit in you

763
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,280
 that brings clarity into our heart.

764
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,880
 And when we sit, and when we are reading the Bible,

765
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,160
 when we are praying, when we are interacting with people,

766
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,960
 when we are listening in the sermon,

767
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,440
 the Holy Spirit is in work, in us,

768
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,520
 bringing us conviction,

769
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,880
 and we shout to God, "Oh no, I've sinned against you.

770
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,400
 "What shall we do?"

771
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,640
 When you think back to the moment

772
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,120
 you first put up your hand to receive Jesus,

773
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,080
 or the time you felt deeply

774
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,240
 that something in your life needed to change,

775
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,800
 that wasn't your reasoning or your emotions at work.

776
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,480
 It was the Holy Spirit inside you,

777
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,120
 moving you, bringing conviction into your heart.

778
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,800
 It's not a conviction to shame you or to guilt you,

779
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,560
 as if you're letting God down if you don't get it right.

780
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,920
 Rather, it is a conviction

781
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,760
 that wakes you up to the reality of God's love

782
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,200
 and beauty of what Jesus has done for you.

783
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,440
 The Spirit doesn't just simply point out what's wrong.

784
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,560
 He draws us towards what is right.

785
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,840
 He opens our eyes to see Jesus more clearly,

786
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,160
 and moves us to turn away from old patterns

787
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,080
 and step into a new way of living.

788
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,680
 This is conviction that comes not from fear or punishment,

789
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,800
 but from hope.

790
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:18,000
 Hope that change is possible, that forgiveness is real,

791
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,960
 and that Jesus welcomes us into this new life.

792
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,880
 So when you feel this gentle nudge to turn from old habits,

793
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,960
 to embrace something new that God is calling you to,

794
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,280
 recognize that it is the Spirit's loving work,

795
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,480
 drawing you closer to Jesus and making you more like Him,

796
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,400
 not by your own strength,

797
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,760
 but by His empowering presence within you.

798
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,600
 We are not left alone.

799
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,480
 We are not left alone.

800
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,240
 The Holy Spirit empowers us to be witnesses,

801
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,320
 not in extraordinary moments,

802
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,840
 but in the ordinary, everyday rhythm of life.

803
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,040
 This is what makes our witness undeniable.

804
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,320
 It is not about having it all together,

805
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,080
 but about letting the reality of Jesus

806
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,640
 shine through our real transformed lives.

807
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,640
 The world can't ignore a life changed by God.

808
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,400
 The world can't ignore you being changed by God.

809
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,640
 The world cannot ignore the fact that in the old you,

810
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,840
 the past you, you will feel agitated,

811
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,040
 you will be angry, you will react in an impulsive way.

812
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,920
 But then in that moment, you chose to quiet down.

813
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,960
 The world cannot ignore that.

814
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,880
 The world cannot ignore the fact that

815
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,360
 I should make this decision at work

816
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,720
 because everyone is doing the same,

817
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,000
 but then you chose differently.

818
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,520
 That decision, that turn,

819
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,800
 your colleagues cannot ignore that.

820
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,880
 Your classmate cannot ignore the fact that

821
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,600
 when you go into the classroom,

822
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,520
 you speak to those that were being ignored.

823
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,080
 Your family members cannot ignore the fact that

824
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,680
 usually when they shouted at you,

825
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,880
 when they talk mean things about you,

826
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,120
 you would slam the door.

827
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,000
 They cannot ignore the fact that you chose to listen.

828
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,920
 We do not need to do anything great,

829
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,280
 but in our every moment, in our every decision,

830
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,840
 we choose Jesus because He has won.

831
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,800
 He has freed us from comparison.

832
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,280
 He has freed us from self-centeredness.

833
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,720
 We can embrace this new life and this new hope.

834
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,320
 And if you have not received it yet,

835
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,400
 you do not need to be guilt-tripped by doing this.

836
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,760
 It is not something that we will judge,

837
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,160
 oh, you're not doing that.

838
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,640
 That was a Christian.

839
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,480
 No.

840
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,760
 Before the commission, there was this promise.

841
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,520
 Before you need to do the action,

842
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,400
 remember you receive this new life first.

843
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,200
 You receive this grace that God has given you first.

844
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,280
 You receive it first, and then you be witness

845
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,200
 of what the grace, the love, the freedom

846
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,560
 that you have received to show people

847
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,760
 in your family, in your workplace, and in your home.

848
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,000
 We may feel ordinary.

849
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,880
 We may feel unprepared.

850
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,160
 But God delights in using ordinary people,

851
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,920
 people just like me and you, maybe,

852
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,320
 to carry out His extraordinary mission.

853
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,680
 He doesn't ask us to do it alone

854
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,760
 or to muster up our own strength

855
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,080
 or to pretend we've had it all together.

856
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,800
 He simply asks us to trust Him,

857
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,120
 to seek His presence in His word

858
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,440
 and in our quiet time with Him,

859
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,680
 to receive His Spirit, to receive His grace,

860
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,440
 and to take the next step as witness right where we are.

861
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,920
 What if we truly believe that the Spirit is with us

862
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,480
 in every conversation?

863
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,920
 What if we believe that the Holy Spirit

864
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,120
 will empower us in every act of kindness,

865
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,520
 every moment when we choose to love,

866
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,440
 to forgive or to speak up for what is right?

867
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,480
 What if, as a church, we lean in together,

868
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,840
 allowing the Holy Spirit to transform our weaknesses

869
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,840
 into testimonies, our failures into stories of God's grace

870
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:34,280
 and our everyday lives into evidence that Jesus is alive?

871
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,280
 Let's be the people where others see more

872
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,480
 than just good intentions or nice program.

873
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,040
 Let's be a people who live so honestly with such hope

874
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,680
 that those around us can't help

875
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,640
 but see the reality of Jesus in us.

876
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,960
 Let our lives be undeniable proof

877
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,040
 that Jesus' victory is real,

878
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,080
 that His Holy Spirit really does change everything.

879
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:10,560
 You are called, you are empowered, and you are sent.

880
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,720
 And I don't know where you are at with Jesus right now.

881
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,760
 Maybe at this moment, if you ask yourself, you go,

882
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,520
 actually, I don't have a relationship with Jesus.

883
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,880
 That was the prayer I prayed at home, in the bathroom,

884
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,040
 a few weeks after my father passed away.

885
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,200
 I was a Christian for most of my life

886
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,160
 because my grandma was a Christian.

887
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,040
 She made every single one of her sons

888
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,080
 and in-laws to go to church.

889
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,200
 I also went to church when I was really young.

890
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,040
 But when my father passed away,

891
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,000
 it forced me to ask this question,

892
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,560
 God, are you there for me?

893
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,680
 And it made me realize that I don't really

894
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,400
 have a relationship with Jesus.

895
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,880
 I know a lot about Him,

896
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,120
 but I don't have a relationship with Him.

897
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,040
 And today, if you have to be honest with yourself,

898
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,280
 do you feel you have a relationship with Jesus?

899
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,680
 So right now, I would like the worship team to come up

900
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,600
 and I would like to give a moment for you

901
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,800
 to reflect on this.

902
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,160
 And just to be honest, God is a loving God.

903
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,160
 He knows it already, but there is power

904
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,120
 when we bring things into the light.

905
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,320
 Maybe at this moment, you do not have

906
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,920
 a relationship with Jesus, but He is calling you.

907
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,320
 So with every eyes closed right now,

908
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,880
 with every head bow,

909
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,520
 I would like you to speak to Jesus.

910
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:08,840
 He loves you.

911
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,120
 And He wants to.

912
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,800
 And He wants you to be honest with Him.

913
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:22,400
 And in this moment, if you know that you may not

914
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,160
 have a relationship with Him, but you want to,

915
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,960
 you want to receive this grace,

916
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,680
 you want to receive this love,

917
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,000
 you want to receive this abundant life that He promised,

918
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,680
 and you want to turn away from the old way of life

919
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,240
 because that has not been working out for you.

920
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,480
 You have tried, you have used your own effort,

921
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,960
 your own way of living, and it did not work.

922
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,440
 You were hurting yourself, you were hurting people

923
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,080
 around you, and you did not have a relationship with Jesus.

924
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,600
 I'd like you, just at your seat,

925
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,320
 that you want to receive this Jesus in your life

926
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,480
 to put up your hand.

927
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,080
 (gentle music)

928
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:15,640
 He loves you, and He waits for you in every single moment.

929
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,880
 I see that hand, thank you.

930
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,680
 Maybe you are a Christian,

931
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,920
 but you have not been relying

932
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,840
 on the Holy Spirit's empowerment.

933
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,200
 You have all the good intentions,

934
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,480
 but when you're trying to show people that Jesus lives,

935
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,400
 you fell short.

936
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,840
 I want to pray for you.

937
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:57,520
 If you are one of those people that you want to be empowered

938
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,520
 by the Holy Spirit today to live out the victorious life,

939
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,640
 the reality that Jesus is alive,

940
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,800
 I would like you to open up your hand

941
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,320
 and to receive this Holy Spirit that empowers you

942
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,440
 to live victoriously, to live differently.

943
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,000
 Jesus, we thank you, because today,

944
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,800
 someone here has made a decision to follow you.

945
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,920
 I pray that by your grace and your power,

946
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,600
 that you are going to fill him up with the Holy Spirit

947
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,160
 to empower him to turn from his old ways and to run to you.

948
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:01,560
 I pray that as he make his decision to receive you,

949
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,560
 that you will give him and honor him

950
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,040
 and know that you will give him an abundant life.

951
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,880
 Thank you for dying for us on the cross.

952
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,800
 Thank you for forgiving our sin.

953
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,320
 Today, we turn away from our past way of life

954
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,840
 and to turn to you, Jesus, and we thank you.

955
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,840
 For this new life that is ahead of the people,

956
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,560
 and we pray in Jesus' name, amen.

957
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,520
 And I pray for the people

958
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,240
 who also wants to be empowered by the Holy Spirit today

959
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,760
 to live a life of victorious life,

960
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,560
 that in every single moment,

961
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,560
 that we are going to know the presence

962
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,560
 of the Holy Spirit with us.

963
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,440
 In our action, in our speech, in our decision,

964
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,120
 your empowerment is real.

965
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,840
 Your presence is undeniable.

966
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,240
 And today, we're going to learn to seek you.

967
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:23,760
 We'll learn to be with you in all that we do.

968
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,840
 And we are thankful for that.

969
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,960
 And in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
