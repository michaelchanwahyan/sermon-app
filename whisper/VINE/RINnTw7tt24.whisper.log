[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   You guys are a little asleep, but that's okay.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Okay, so I have a question for you.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   You know those people, those people with kids,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   those people with kids who can do the smallest, most insignificant thing,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   and they'll freak out about how their kid's a genius.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Like their kid could pick their nose and show it to mom and dad,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   and mom and dad will be like, "Oh my God, he's going to Harvard!"
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   You guys know those people?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Ugh.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   I've become one of those people.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   My son, Elias James Armstrong, is one year, three months.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I want to clarify, he's not 15 months.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   When you hit the one-year mark, we start saying one year in certain months.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   He's not 15 months. He's one year and three months.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And actually, recently, I've become convinced that little Elias is also a genius.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   And I post about it all over my social media,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   so I'm sorry if you feel like I'm spamming you.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   But this is what he's done recently.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I've asked him, I said, "You can literally ask him any question in the world."
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Kind of.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   "You can ask him any question that has to do with animals and what sounds they'll make."
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And he'll give you the right answer.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   So you can go up to Elias and you'll say, "Elias, what sound does a lion make?"
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And Elias will like, kind of curl up a little bit,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   he'll put his arms up and he'll go, "Ahh!"
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And it's pretty cute.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Second one, you can ask him, "Elias, what sound does a puppy make?"
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Now, not a dog, what sound does a puppy make?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And he won't, kind of like, bark, bark.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   He'll put his hands up and go, "Arf, arf!"
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And he literally sounds like a puppy. It's absolutely adorable.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And there's one animal that he just hasn't gotten quite down yet.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   You can ask him, "Elias, what sound does a cow make?"
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Now, we read all these books about cows and cows jumping over the moon,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and we even say the moon word, "moon."
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   He doesn't get it.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   If you ask him, "What sound does a cow make?"
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Elias will look at you and he'll make a sound that I like to describe
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   as a vacuum cleaner crossed over with helium.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And it sounds a little bit like, "Ahh!"
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And the crazy thing is that he does it every single sound.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Like, he's committed to that sound being what sound a cow makes.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Recently, I decided to push my luck a little bit.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I said, "I want to see if Elias knew what Daddy said."
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So I asked him the question, "Elias, what does Dada say?"
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Now, clarification, my wife did carry this baby for nine months,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   and she wakes up in the middle of the night, and she feeds him,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   and she prays for him, and does all the great things.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   But I'm the fun parent at home.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I'm the one doing all the crazy things, breaking all the rules,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   doing the things you shouldn't do, feeding him cake when he shouldn't have cake,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   all the fun things.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So, you know, we dance together, we listen to BTS together,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   we do hand motions together, we do all of it.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   For that reason, I expected him to give a very fun, lively,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   something that reflected me kind of answer.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So we asked Elias, "Elias, what does Dada say?"
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   He looks at me, and he goes, "Ffff, ffff, ffff, ffff, ffff."
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Not really the sound I was going for.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So fun fact, I have the worst allergies in the world.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Every morning when I wake up, I go straight to the bathroom,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   and I blow my nose, and I make that horrible, terrible sound,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   trying to get all the nastiness out.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And my son has somehow attributed that to what sound Daddy makes.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I've somehow become an influencer, y'all.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   My kid gets it. Daddy makes the ffff sound.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I'm pretty frustrated by that. I don't like it. I don't like it at all.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   But it has shown me that in like the small, simple ways,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I've been able to influence him.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I've been able to have some kind of impact on his life.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Not the impact I want. Hopefully I'll have better impact in the future.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   But my silly little nose-blowing moment every single morning
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   has somehow influenced him, and it's taught me a little bit about the power of influence.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   It wasn't something grand that I did. It's something subtle.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It wasn't even for him. It was in the bathroom away from him.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   But somehow he's been influenced.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   He's been impacted by just that little small thing.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I've learned that influence is very similar to that.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   It's not about status in society or even your social media followers.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   We feel a little blue tick.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Does anyone here have a blue tick, by the way?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Influencers? Okay, cool.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Influence is measured differently than the way that we might think.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It's actually about the impact that can take place
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   in the small ways that we engage with one another.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Our little decisions, what we stand for, what we do or perhaps what we don't do.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   It's our little decisions and how we interact.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   That's the kind of stuff that will affect people indirectly and in tangible ways.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Without being forceful, without commanding it,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   we can produce an effect on others all around us.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   This is influence.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   It's something simple.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It happens every single day of your life and we're just not aware of it.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Look at it this way.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Our impact is a direct byproduct of our influence.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'll say that again.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   The impact that you're making is a direct byproduct of our influence.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Let me tell you something else about influence.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   There's more.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Influence is potentially bigger than we might recognize for something so small.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   The word that's most commonly used when you ask the top leadership gurus
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   define leadership, they'll break it down to one word.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   That word is influence.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   See, what we see as small moments of impact is influence.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And influence is leadership.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So in these small moments every day, the things that we do,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   actually it's leadership.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Leadership is not just for chief executives or presidents on some geopolitical level.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Leadership happens here in this room, in our homes, on the grassroot levels.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Leadership is in the little stuff.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Now I do understand, everybody is not a leader.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   As I was writing this I was like, I could think of a few people that came to mind
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   that would say, but everyone's not a leader.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I get it, everyone is not a leader.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   But everyone does impact, does make an impact on others in small ways.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   If me blowing my nose can impact my son, something tells me that in the spaces that you live and work
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   and do what you do, your life probably has an impact that you might be unaware of.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And the thing about great leaders is this, they use their influence,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   they use their impact to better those who are around them for their good.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Leadership, when done wrong or actually we examine it, it affects our relationships with one another.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Think about it this way, in Hong Kong we do live in a society where sometimes our leadership looks like racing to the top.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And it can be a challenge to genuinely, authentically celebrate the success of someone else
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   because we oftentimes view our neighbor as our competition.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   We focus on our growth and on our own progression and we can lose sight that the reality of me first sends a message.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   It feeds a cycle.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It can propagate a culture that's actually incompatible with the faith we hold,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   unless we decide to stick to a deep compartmentalization of our faith in our life.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   There's a broken system in leadership when individual gain is the motivation.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Where leadership can become transactional, our relationships feel like we just use one another,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   what can this person do for me and once they're done doing that for me,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   or once I've gotten whatever advantage I need, I discard or no longer really care about them and their well-being.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   That's not really the model that our scriptures show us about relationships or about leadership.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It's not the Jesus way.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Leadership done according to Jesus' model will allow us to impact those in our world and our lives for their own good.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   So whether you're leading in your schools or in your workplace or in your communities or in your families or wherever,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I believe that as we examine Jesus' model of leadership,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   there's some things we can take away that will impact the way that we impact others.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   So how does it work? How do we position ourselves to follow this Jesus' model of leadership?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And what is Jesus' model of leadership?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   The gospel of Mark is a fun gospel.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Across two chapters, and actually it's also in Luke and Matthew,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   but specifically in Mark, across chapters 9 and 10,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   we have this overall examination of greatness.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   So what's happening, let's look at starting with Mark 9.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   You've got the disciples and you're sitting with Jesus and they're asking the question,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   "Who will be the greatest?"
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And greatness is good. No one really wants to be mediocre. I get that. It's a genuine question.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   How do you define the greatness? Who is the greatest?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And Jesus looks at them and he answers them with one of these answers that isn't really an answer.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   It's one of those Jesus answers that doesn't really clarify anything, but he says it and then moves on.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   So what he says is this, "Whoever wants to be first should be last and the servant of all."
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   No explanation after that.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   He just picks up a kid and starts talking about a completely different topic.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And then you have Mark chapter 10, where a very famous story that we've all heard,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   or most of us have heard if you've been here, about a rich young ruler,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   a guy who's gotten all his affairs in order, comes to Jesus and he says,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   "Jesus, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Now if you were here last week, you would have heard Pastor Ellison talk about this question,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   "What can I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   This guy is asking the exact same question.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And Jesus, he looks at Jesus and he tells him,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   "Alright, so of all the things I can think of, I've done all the commandments.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I know what they are and I've followed them. I've checked them off my list.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   So how do I get eternal life?"
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Jesus looks at him and gives him an answer that probably isn't what he's expecting.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   He goes, "Sell all your possessions, give it to the poor, then come follow me."
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Which, if we think about it practically, that answer doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   This guy is a little frustrated and disheartened.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Like, what does my neighbor's well-being and their progress,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   what does that have to do with my piety, with my faith journey, with my relationship with God?
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   But this is the answer Jesus gives him.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And he ends this entire thing in chapter 10 and says another one of his famous one-liners.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   He says, "Whoever wants to be first must be last."
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   It was the second time in two chapters he's saying this exact same thing.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And when we push further and looking towards verse 35 of the same chapter,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   we have a third example.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Thinking about greatness and examining leadership.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   You have James and John, they come up to Jesus.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And as you look at the slide, we'll read Mark 10, verse 35.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   It reads like this.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   "Then James and John, sons of Zebedee, came to him.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   'Teacher,' they said, 'we want you to do for us whatever we ask.'"
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Pause.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   If anyone ever comes up to you and just asks that question,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   maybe ask them what they want, because that's a bit of a slightly dodgy question.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Whatever we're going to ask you, just say yes.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   It's how they're approaching this.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   So you can kind of infer that something shady is about to go down.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   "So what do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   "They replied, 'Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.'"
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   And I can imagine at this point, Jesus hears this,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   and he does that like face to palm, palm to face emoji thing, hand on the head.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   He's like, "Oh, they don't get it."
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   He goes, "You don't know what you're asking.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   But can you drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism I'm baptized with?"
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   To which, slightly rhetorical question, they say, "Yes, we can.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   We're very confident. Yes, we can."
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Again, Jesus probably puts his palm to his face.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   He's like, "They're not getting it."
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   He goes, "Well, you will drink the cup I drink,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   and you will be baptized with the baptism I'm baptized with.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   But to sit at my right or my left is not for me to grant.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And when the other guys heard about it, the other 10, they became indignant.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Fancy word for pretty mad.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Where James and John.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   So here again, we have James and John, two of Jesus' close disciples
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   who've been walking with him for some time.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   And what they're doing is they're approaching him for some shady business.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   They're probably, I imagine, whispering it to him so that the other 10 can't hear it.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   They're coming to Jesus first, and they're like, "Jesus, when you reign,"
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   because their expectation is that Jesus is going to reign over all the world as king.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   "When that day comes, can we get a place?
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Can we be up top? Can we be some of your chosen people?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Can we have a place of leadership, of influence, of impact?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Can we be in a position that shows others that we are great?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   We want a seat at the table."
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And I think they're operating from the concept of the early bird gets the worm.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   When I was in the US, we played this game.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Well, it wasn't really a game. It was more of a lifestyle,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   where if you're driving in a car or you're going to the car,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   the first person to say, "Shotgun," gets to sit up front,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   and everybody else is cramming the back.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   If you're the first one there, you get the prize.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And I feel like these disciples are operating from the same place.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   They're asking Jesus this early on so that they can be in a position of power.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   And Jesus responds, not answering their question, of course.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   He gives them--he's one of those guys, one of those friends,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   where you ask him a question, and then he gives you another question.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Somebody did that to me this week, and I didn't like it.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   You know who you are.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Anyways, he answers them by asking them a question.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   "Can you drink from the cup that I am going to drink,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   or be baptized with the baptism that I will be baptized with?"
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Which is a very confusing sentence.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   These two things, what do cups and baptism have to do with what Jesus--
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   what leadership is about?
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Well, it's not really anything about leadership.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Jesus is actually using these two things symbolically
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   to talk about the journey he's about to go on to the cross.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   And actually, in this same passage, Jesus has clearly--
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   and given a clear, detailed play-by-play, almost,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   of what's going to happen to him when he reaches Jerusalem.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   He tells him that he will be condemned to death,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   he will be beaten, he will be spit on, he will be flogged,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   and then they'll actually kill him.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   And then he will be raised to life again on the third day.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   So James and John have just heard this, and Jesus says,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   "Can you do all these things?"
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   And they're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're good, we got it. We can do it."
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   These two are, one, either terrible listeners,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   and completely missed what he said,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   or two, they're grossly overconfident in their own ability.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Or three, actually.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   James and John have the wrong expectation of the coming Messiah,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   much like everybody else in that time would have.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   See, they are expecting Jesus to come and rule and reign
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   and be some all-conquering king,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   and they want a seat at that table.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   They don't understand that the kingdom of God
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   is nothing like the culture of the day,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   the Greco-Roman way of power and leadership.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Jesus is literally about to turn their understanding
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   of ruling and leadership and greatness on its head,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   give them a completely different understanding
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   of what that is to look like.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Before he does, I love that Mark writes this gospel.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   He adds a little bit that the other disciples are pretty mad
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   when they hear about what James and John are doing.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   And, you know, I get it.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   To be fair, the other ten were probably just a little frustrated
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   that they weren't the first ones to ask,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   'cause maybe they would have gotten it.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   But that's because they knew that's how relationships work.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   They knew that's how leadership and greatness operated.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Greatness was about getting ahead.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   If you can get the before the other person, even better.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   That was the way of operating.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Does it remind us of anything in our world and in our culture today?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   I love that Jesus turns this into a proper teaching moment.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   He didn't just give them a one-liner.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   He actually expands on this.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   In verse 42, he says this,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   lord it over them," important phrase, "lord it over them,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   and their high officials exercise authority over them."
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   In this statement, Jesus calls his disciples,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   and I think us, to examine our understanding
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   and the norms of leadership and of greatness,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   and the characteristics that we would attribute
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   to greatness and leadership.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   See, the Greco-Roman leaders were the ones who were at the top
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   of a top-down system, a largely militaristic, authoritative system
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   that was drenched in deep prejudice and racial undertones.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   See, these kinds of leaders were the ones who were the wealthiest of the wealthy.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   They were the ones who had the best reach and the best network
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   and had earned the most and had achieved the most.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   These guys had learned everything.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   They had all the achievements for personal success.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   They were the privileged individuals, the ones who would be served.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Funny how things from then to now hasn't necessarily changed all that much.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Greatness can still often today be defined by,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I don't know, how much is in your bank account,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   or a position of power,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   or what tier job do you have in the city,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   your personal income, how big your business is.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   The right people in your specific network somehow gives you worth.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Those are the people, those are the things that we look at
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   to understand leadership today.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   And when we do that, we run the risk of pretending that
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   because someone has accomplished more, because they have studied more,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   because they know more people,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   somehow they have a different and better worth than someone else.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   In that, we end up neglecting the poor and live in a cycle that is driven,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   I heard someone refer to it as like a bit of a rat race,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   by personal progress and self-gain.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Jesus would look at this in the Greco-Roman culture,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   and us today, he would look at the way that we operate,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   the norms of our day, and he would say four very powerful words.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   He would say this, "Not so with you."
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Like, that could be them, but not you guys.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   That's not how you are to live.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Don't carry the same broken system as everyone else.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Don't build yourself after a leadership model
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   that oppresses those who have less.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Don't model yourself after leadership that hurts others.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   That may be the way of the world, but not in my house.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   In other words, my kingdom is different.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I do want to be clear, Jesus,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   I want to talk about what Jesus isn't saying.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Jesus is not saying that because you're excellent,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   and you've achieved a lot, or you've earned a lot,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   or you know the right people, or you have a high degree,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   that all of a sudden you're anti-kingdom of God.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   He's not pointing to that.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   He's actually pointing to something a bit deeper.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Excellent and achievement and all these things aren't bad things.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   He's not condemning it.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Actually, over the years of church history,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   theologians have looked at the idea of sin,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   and this is a really interesting thought, so dial in here.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   They say this, that sin is simply virtue running wild,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   because God has planted in the hearts of every creature
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   an aspiration for significance.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   It's how he's made us.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   But unchecked, we tend to bend that good aspiration
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   into a desire to dominate others.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   We can sometimes get so intoxicated with greatness and succeeding
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   and being the best and being number one,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   that we only see our value through our progress alone,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   absent of how others are doing, absent of our neighbors.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And then so we diminish the value of others.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   We look at it as my value comes from not being at the very bottom.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And in our desire to make sure we get to the top
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   or somewhere of significance,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   we accidentally end up pushing down, neglecting, ignoring
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   those who are in need of us.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And this happens in church too.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   I'll give you a fun example.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I was listening to a podcast.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And in this podcast, the person who's talking
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   is a spoken word kind of rapper artist.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And she and her friend are both spoken word rapper people.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And they rap and they speak words and they do it in really cool ways.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And people really love it.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   And so they are hoping one day that they'll get signed.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   They're doing all these big performances.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   They're performing in church.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   They love Jesus.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   They're good church people.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   And her friend ends up getting a record deal.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   And I love how honest she is
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   because the reality is that if we were as honest,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   we might realize we're in the same boat.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Her friend got the record deal.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   And even though all the things we church people do is for God's glory,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   it made her feel some kind of way.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   She was bothered.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Jealousy and comparison kind of snuck in.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   And what should be something worth celebrating for another
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   because it's all for the kingdom of God
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   ends up being something that divides friendship
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   from neighbor to competition.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Jesus would look at our church and our world today
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   and he would say, "Not so with you."
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And as followers of Jesus,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   we are meant to live in a way that's not even just a little bit different,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   like fully different, like a full 180.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Like contrary, opposite to this method.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   His kingdom is different.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   It's not just different, it's upside down.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   It's a great word people use to describe it.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   So if we look at verse 43, you'll see on the screen,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   he starts off by saying this word, "Instead."
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Just kind of showing us how serious, like unlike this,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   you can substitute,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   unlike what we see in leaders who exercise their authorities over others
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   and lord over them.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Instead of being that way, unlike that,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   And whoever wants to be first must be a slave of all.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   For the son of man, which the king, God himself,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   did not come into the world to be served by people,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   but to serve and not just serve,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   to give his life as a ransom for many.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Greatness means becoming a servant.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   To get ahead means becoming a slave.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Great leaders are those who focus on others.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   They are slaves of all.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   This is again opposite to what we see, what we experience as a norm.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Leadership isn't about running to the front.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   I heard a pastor say this,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   "Leadership is actually a race to the back of the line."
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   I want us to look at the words that Jesus uses in this passage
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   because he used some pretty strong words,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   words that we probably would never want to refer to ourselves as in regular context.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   So the first word he uses here is servant, which is the word diakonos.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And it means a couple of things.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Servant can refer to the house servant that actually brings the meal
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   and prepares the table and sets things up for the other person's benefit
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   with no actual progress of their own.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   That's one definition.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   It's probably an easy definition.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   We all know that.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   You didn't need to see it in Greek to understand what a servant is.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   But a servant, the reason I put this word up there
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   is because there's another word that's somewhat common to the Christian folk.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   We use the word deacon a lot.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And deacon is derivative of this word, diakonos.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   That's the word that Paul would use when he would define leadership in God's kingdom,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   in God's people, in God's eyes.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   What it looks like to lead isn't the people who have achieved the most,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   the people who have separated themselves from the crowd.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   No, it's the people who are racing to the back of the line,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   the people who are bringing the food and making sure that everybody else has what they need,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   whose focus is the other.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   That's what leadership through God's eyes would look like.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Nothing about personal progress or me being elevated.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   It's a display of humility to work towards the needs of another.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Second word that Mark would use here, that Jesus would use, that Mark would write,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   is the word doulos.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   This word speaks of the slave, someone whose entire livelihood and purpose
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   is determined for them by another.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Jesus says, "Whoever wants to be the first must be a slave of all people."
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   That word never has a positive connotation.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   I've never heard anyone like, "Yeah, I'm a slave,"
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   except for Paul later on, but he was very spiritual.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   But that's just not our natural position, is it?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Our posture is not to forget what I need to get accomplished.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   They matter.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Ask yourself when was the last time you genuinely felt--
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I ask myself when was the last time I genuinely felt that.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   But these are the two words Jesus uses.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   To be a slave is about attributing all this worth and attention and value to the other.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   And slave and servant have a very beautiful connection,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   where to be a servant would speak of the work that we do,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   to be a slave would speak of our posture, our status, our position.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And Jesus' model is calling leadership to assume a status
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   and to do a work that involves-- that is primarily focused on the other.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   It's strong language.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And I think Jesus knew that when he said it.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   He was trying to make a strong point.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   He uses slave and servant to communicate the mark of humble relationships.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Keyword, humble relationships.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   He's helping his disciples see that greatness and leadership
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   look a lot more like positioning oneself in a way that serves the good of the other
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   and less like the early bird gets the worm,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   running to the front of the line or calling shotgun.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   And I love that we have this story right after the rich, young ruler.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Pastor Ellison hit on a point last week about how we want to inherit eternal life.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   We want to enter into that greatness that God has waiting for us.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   And Jesus confuses this guy by talking about how eternal life
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   is built off of your relationship with the others.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Somehow that's just as important.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And it makes me think that Jesus' whole idea of us becoming Christian
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   and us getting saved, it doesn't make a lot of sense if it's about us,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   if it's all about us and our personal journey.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   It's actually incompatible.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Why would we get saved and then we're still here?
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Why are we still here if we're already believers?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   If our future is already secure, what's the point of being here?
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   It's not by accident. He didn't forget.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   No, He's left us here with a bunch of other people,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   with a bunch of neighbors, with a bunch of one another's to serve,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   to become the slave of, to elevate, to push forward,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   to work for their well-being.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   He's got a reason for you existing with other people.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   It's not by accident.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   And it makes me wonder, like, we have to get to a place where our eyes are on the other.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Because a lot of times our eyes aren't, they're on us.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   They're on me and my close friends or me and my people or me and my family.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   We really care about the well-being of us and our family.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   I really believe Jesus would look at us and say, "Not so with you."
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   It's not just about you and your family, you and your kingdom.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   In His kingdom, we are wired, we are created to be a people
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   whose posture and work prefers the other,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   whose position and whose work benefit those out there more than me.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   He's called us to be humble leaders, to be in humble relationships.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And humility is that key.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   So when we think about how do we take this concept of being a slave
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   and being a servant and all that stuff and apply it into our worlds,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   all right, two things for us.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   The first thing starts like this, choosing humility.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Just choose to be humble.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Humble is a hard thing to do.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   But the humble leadership is the type of leadership
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   that actually has the deeper life-changing impact.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Jesus knew about that when He called us to the posture,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   that we would have a drive to want to succeed
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and really care about us and our people and really--
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   And it's not even that we're doing it because we're mean people.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Like, I want to clarify something.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   It's not just like, "Oh, we just hate other people."
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   No, we just get so focused on us and us and us.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Jesus is like, "Look out. There's other people around.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Think about them. Consider where they are."
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   That's the kind of leadership He's called us to be,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   and that's Jesus' model.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   And His way can only be done if we're secure in who we are in Christ,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   when we have nothing to prove.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   There's this quote I want to read to us that I found just very beautiful.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   It'll show up again at some other point in the sermon.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   It says this, "Blessed is the man or the woman
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   who can sincerely and gladly rejoice when others are exalted,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   but they themselves is overlooked and passed by."
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I'll read it one more time.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   "Blessed is the man or woman who can sincerely and gladly rejoice
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   when others are exalted,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   though they themselves be overlooked and passed by."
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   That kind of leadership is cross-carrying leadership,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   putting the needs of others as priority.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   That's only possible when you choose the humble path.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And our leadership will have the ability to go down this counter-cultural road
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   of others focused, others first, by choosing humility.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   I think the temptation is that when we end up focusing on ourselves
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   and measuring up to a metric that's ever-changing in our world,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   and I think that's what actually perpetuates the rat race.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Like we're trying to become the best at this,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   but awesome in 2011 is different than awesome in 2015,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   which is different than awesome in 2022.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Like greatness keeps changing.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   It's not in our favor to chase those things.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   It keeps moving.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   It indeed becomes an actual rat race.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And God is calling us out of that mentality,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   out of chasing the ever-changing system.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Instead, by choosing humility,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   He's calling us to look at the other people,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   look at their worth.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   You know, He died for you, but He also died for them.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   His blood being spilled is for the person next to you,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   as well as you.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   That's something we have to remember.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   That gives our neighbor and those around us
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   an inherent, limitless worth and value.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   The image of God is breathed into them
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   as much as it's breathed into us.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   And I think by changing,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   by seeing things through this perspective,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Jesus' model will change the way that we see people.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   It will no longer have that distorted,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   "What can they do for me?
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   "How do they potentially help me progress?
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   "What ways does this benefit me?"
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And it can just be about them.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Just be about their good.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   This is the change that His model takes us through.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   This is where influence has a maximum impact.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Jesus' model is just as much about influence
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   as the world's model.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   But He approaches it from a completely different angle.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   See, true influence is not lording it over others.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   It's not viewing our neighbors as our competitor.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   It's not just looking out for me
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   and my best friends and my family.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   No, true influence is serving others
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   so that they might become more.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   I love that Jesus, in this passage,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   gives us this great theoretical concept,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   and then He ends it really beautifully
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   by giving us a good example.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   He says, "The Son of Man, the King, God,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   "the One who created everything,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   "the One who everything belongs to,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   "the Christ who was preeminent above everything,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   "the firstborn of all creation,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   "that guy came to serve and not to be served."
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   He gives us a beautiful example
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   of what humility in servant leadership looks like.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And Paul would actually echo,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   and not just echo, he would expand this concept
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   in Philippians 2, where he would say
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   that Jesus did not see His godness,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   His divine right.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   He did not look at Himself in this space
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   of I'm equal with God.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   He actually put that stuff to the side.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   He did not take, I think the very words,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   He did not take equality with God
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   as something to be grasped.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   He wasn't looking for advantages for Him.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   He was looking for advantages for you.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   So instead, He emptied Himself.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   He put it to the side
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   and He took on the form of a servant,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   and then Paul pushes it forward.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   He humbled Himself even to the point
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   of death on a cross.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   For what?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   To make a point?
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   But so that we might be reconciled to God.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Like His leadership, His servanthood,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   and His slavery impacts you.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   It's the reason that we can be here
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   and be close and near to God.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   It's the reason that we can have eternal life.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   It's the reason for our whole faith.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   What He did, assuming the lowest position possible,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   is how we were able to make it forward.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   That's His example of leadership.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Counting the neighbor as more important.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Paul would continue in Philippians.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   He would say, He would challenge us
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   to do nothing out of selfish ambition,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   to not just focus on ourselves,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   but to look at the interest of others,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   not just our own,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   to take that mindset that Christ had in His humility.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   And we should use that in how we engage with others
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   in leadership and in serving roles,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   becoming a servant to others.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Jesus is changing.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   He's not changing leadership.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   He's just showing us how to do it the right way.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   And actually the most impactful way
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   that the world's ever seen.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   And in Him, we have a model of humble leadership,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   a posture of humble relationships,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   a leader who serves the growth of others
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   and the betterment of them and chooses humility.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And there's a second way that I want to encourage us.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   So we choose humility as the first thing.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   The second thing is,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   I want us to see how we can embrace
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   this Jesus model in our prayer lives.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Now I pray, a pastor, I pray.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And I would say I'm not like the best prayer.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Like I can't just pray for like five hours straight,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   like the super, super, super spiritual people.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   But I have realized, I have noticed
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   that when life throws everything at me,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   in those moments where, yeah, it's hard,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   where I hurt, where I don't know my way out,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   where I'm at a breaking point,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   I can pray, y'all.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   I can pray real good.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Pray for a long time.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And I can fervently, hands and knees,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   like God, I can call out to God.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   I can cry out to God.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   I can get real serious in my prayer.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   It is passionate.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   It is continuous.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   It is that praying without ceasing that Paul talks about.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   I think we can all find ourselves in that situation as well.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   When the moment is right,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   when something isn't going right,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   when it's dire, when it's life or death,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   man, we can pray that God will heal us,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   that he will help us,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   that he will help our best interest move forward.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   So here's my challenge.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   This week, pray, pray,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   for something that doesn't impact you at all.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Try that.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Pray fervently.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Pray passionately.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Pray without ceasing.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   For someone that's not in your circle.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   I'll push it further.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   Pray for someone that's not in your family.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Pray for something that doesn't actually benefit you at all.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   I mean, imagine what a week of God's people doing that would look like.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Imagine what our perspective would look like.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   I wonder if we challenge ourselves to pray for others,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   we probably would talk to others,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   we'd actually know what's going on in their lives.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   It would domino into us actually being a good neighbor.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Oh, the Bible's connected.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   It's beautiful.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   But challenge yourself.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   It's gonna be a challenge for me too.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   It's not just, I'm not just saying you guys do it.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   I'm gonna be doing this as well.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Pray for something that doesn't directly benefit me,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   that gives me no profit.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Man, then I can begin seeing the value in people
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   with a love that prefers the other.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   And I think this is the way that we actually bring about change in our city.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   After what we experienced over the past few years,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   blue, yellow, COVID and like,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   don't talk to people and being scared of everybody,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   and still just the natural tendency of Hong Kong's rat race to the top
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   and to more and more and more.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   The way we heal is not by looking at individual interests.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   The way we heal is by healing together.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   I am an African American.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   This is not in my notes, I apologize.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   I just wanna give an example because this is really big.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   There's something in black American culture that is pretty dominant.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   You'll hear people talk about the idea that you haven't made it
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   until you brought everybody else with you.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   And it's this idea that maybe you started rags to riches
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   or started in rags and you made it to riches,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   but just 'cause you made it to riches and they aren't also being elevated,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   you've not made it to anything.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Like, could we seek the betterment of Hong Kong as a whole,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   of our neighbors and not just us?
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Can we want them to make it just as far as we make it?
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Like, man, that would be something if the church is full of people
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   who really, really wanna see the better for the others.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   I think the healing that God's gonna bring in our city is gonna look like that.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Again, not by everyone looking at their own interests,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   but looking towards the interests of one another.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   The healing God will bring will come in the humility of God's people.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   And so, church, may we never forget, based off of Mark 9 and 10,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   what greatness looks like.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   It doesn't consist about being an admiral or a general or a statesman
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   or having certain things or an artist.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   It consists of devoting ourselves, body, soul, and spirit,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   to the blessed work of making our fellow men and women more holy and more happy.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   So may we mourn with those who mourn.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   May we celebrate with those who are actually celebrating.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   In humility, may we bear one another's burdens.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   As Galatians says, may we outdo each other in serving one another.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   May the greatness we seek be the progress of our neighbor.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   And may this be how we live, influencing the relationships, impacting one another.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   And I wanna take the next couple of minutes just to reflect a little bit.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   So the band's gonna come up and get up on stage,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   and I know the usual run of things.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   The band comes up, we start getting like, okay, time to go.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Please don't just run out.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Like, they're gonna come up, they're not gonna sing,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   they're just gonna play for a minute,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   but we're gonna have a little reflection time.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And when I finish, I'll pray, and I want you to just stay seated.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Don't get up and sing, don't raise your hand yet, just sit and think and ask God.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   Like, I just wanna go through the motions of, okay, sermon's over, let's sing,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   and let's go home.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   And I think God has much more for us than that.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Maybe you're here today and the Holy Spirit is pointing at something in your life.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   I want us to reflect on that.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Maybe God is calling you to consider your relationships,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   not just the ones with your friends, but with everybody else.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   He's asking you whether or not your relationships are transactional.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Have you positioned yourself in any degree as a servant or a slave?
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   I know those are hard words.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   It's convicting, not just for you, it's convicting for me.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   It's my second time preaching it, it's still convicting to me.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   And conviction really isn't known to feel good,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   but conviction does lead us to growth.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   And that's exactly what I think God wants to do.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   He's putting His finger on these things, and in that,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   He's calling us to bring it to Him.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Bring Him the relationships where you feel you weren't cared for.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   The leadership spaces where you felt like you were just used for your talent
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   and then, meh, discarded.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Or where you felt like the other person's life and success
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   was of more value than yours.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Where you've been personally impacted and hurt by that.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   I wanna create a time where we can actually reflect and bring that to God.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Bring Him the times where you have felt hurt from leaders
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   having their own interests at heart.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   And I believe that as we do that, He will speak life, value,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   limitless worth back into who you are.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   I think there's a second side of this coin.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   There are those of us who, uncomfortably,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   but if we were to be even more honest with ourselves,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   we'd say maybe we were the ones that made another feel that way.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Maybe our leadership has done that to people.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   Maybe we've lorded it over those that we lead,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   those that we're just in relationship with.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   We somehow see ourselves because of what we've accomplished as,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   we never say it out loud, but a bit more important, more special, more valuable.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Our management styles only benefit ourselves.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   And we're only working for our own progress.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   The way we lead our families might be for our own interest.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   God doesn't come to condemn us.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   There's still no shame in this house.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   That wasn't just true before the sermon.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   It's still now.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   There is no shame in this.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Probably a lot of us that can identify in certain ways with that.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   But this is the thing about God.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   He points his finger there and he draws you close if you'll let him.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   He's not drawing to condemn you.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   God's gentle.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   God's forgiving.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Just ask.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   This is easy.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   How great is that?
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Just ask.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   And in his gentleness, as he draws you,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   his spirit will start to speak, will start to reveal,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   will start to clean out some of the things that we need to get removed from us
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   in order to live like he's called us to live.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   God is loving, guys.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   He's gentle.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   And in this response, I just challenge you to focus on that.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Let him do what he wants to do.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Let his spirit speak where it wants to speak.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   And so I'm going to pray, but stay seated.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Don't get up.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Don't leave.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Don't start worshiping.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Reflect.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Give yourself some time.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   Sit with this.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Jesus, you are, as Carla said, you are the best shepherd.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   You are the perfect example.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   And we're grateful for who you are.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   We're also grateful that you are gentle, that you love us, that you're not--
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   that you don't condemn us, God, that there's no shame in you,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   but there is reconciliation to be found in you.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   There is restoration and wholeness and a making of us becoming new.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   And so, God, we come before you this morning acknowledging where we have
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   fallen short as your people, where our focus has been on us so much more
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   than it's been on those around us, where our lives and direction is all
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   based on our success and our progress.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   God, we ask you to remove from us the things that make us self-centered,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   that make us seek our own greatness, God, and replace it.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Give us a pure heart, a heart that sees value in our neighbor,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   a heart that will allow us to look towards the interest of the other,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   that will care for the other, the way that you did through the example
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   of Jesus on the cross.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   And Holy Spirit, we invite you to come and speak in this moment
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   while we make space for you.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   Amen.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   [MUSIC]
