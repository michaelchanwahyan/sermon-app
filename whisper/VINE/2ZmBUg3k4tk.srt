1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,940
 Well, when I entered university, I was on academic probation.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,040
 So right from the start, that's how I started off.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,960
 Now, you might wonder why.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,000
 Well, the reason was because I got a very bad score on my SAT exam.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,560
 Now, so if you don't know, SAT exams, you know, they're part of the admission requirements

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,920
 and I had to take it.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,280
 But I have to say in all fairness, I did take the exam after being three months in the US.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,560
 I didn't speak English that well, especially when it comes to math.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,780
 So I didn't understand anything math related on the exam, what they were asking me.

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,600
 And so I just had a hard time.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,000
 But hey, I made it into college.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,600
 So you know, exactly a reason to celebrate.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,320
 But one of the survival skills that I learned in uni, when I was in uni was that I needed

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,040
 to read the course syllabus very carefully.

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,920
 So I understand what's going on, right?

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,000
 So because usually in the course syllabus, you have the exam dates, very important.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,080
 You have the assignments that are due, like your papers and when they're due.

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,280
 And then you also have the information when or how your final grade is calculated.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,000
 You know, what assignment counts, what percentage towards your final grade.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,640
 Now, I didn't pay that close attention my first semester.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,280
 And then you really quickly realize you need to pay attention to that.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,680
 So then I started to look and read.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,640
 And that's amazing how different things are graded by different teachers.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
 You know, for some, it's all about the exam.

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,720
 Every single thing is about the exam.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,360
 For others, it's mainly about the papers.

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,400
 For some, it's about verbal participation, like 30% of your grade or 40% of your grade

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,040
 about how you verbally participate.

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,440
 And then for others, it's group projects.

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:59,040
 So I learned this mantra or I developed this mantra for myself, which was know what matters.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,040
 You need to know what matters so you can then do what matters.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,280
 And so that's something that I learned early on, that these small things and paying attention

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,320
 to these small details can actually make a very big difference in your own personal life.

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,840
 And the smallest of details can have the biggest of impact on you.

35
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,920
 And we can actually see this truth in the Gospel of John, in one of the accounts where

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,040
 we're told about the resurrection of Jesus.

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,680
 And in that, it's this little, in this account from John, there's this little detail that

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,560
 a lot of times we just brush over.

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,760
 But actually, this detail really provides insights and helping us understand the meaning

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,520
 of Easter, the meaning of the resurrection of Jesus.

41
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,320
 And so let me take you to John chapter 20, we're starting in verse one.

42
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
 Let's pick it up there.

43
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
 It says this.

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,840
 Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early while it was still

45
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,980
 dark and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.

46
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:16,080
 So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved,

47
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,760
 and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb and we do not know where they

48
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,600
 have laid him."

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,720
 So Peter went out with the other disciple and they were going towards the tomb.

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,200
 Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,040
 tomb first.

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,960
 Then stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.

53
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,720
 Then Simon Peter came following him and went into the tomb.

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,800
 He saw the linen cloth lying there and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus's head,

55
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,720
 not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a place by itself.

56
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:04,360
 Then the other disciples who had reached the tomb first also went in and he saw and believed.

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,840
 So John here, he is giving us a personal account of what he found on that very Sunday, that

58
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,500
 first Easter Sunday morning.

59
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:21,960
 We could also say it's an eyewitness testimony to what he experienced.

60
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,200
 He reports that Mary Magdalene went early in the morning while it was still dark.

61
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,760
 So basically after the Sabbath was finished and then people were allowed to be mobile

62
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,120
 again, so she goes to the grave.

63
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:43,200
 Apparently he wanted to maybe finish some of the ceremony to put Jesus into the grave.

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,800
 And lo and behold, the stone is rolled away.

65
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,200
 And so she runs back to the disciples and she tells them that somebody has taken the

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,180
 body of Jesus, that they have put it somewhere else.

67
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,360
 Now one thing I want you to notice here that's interesting is that a lot of times we treat

68
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,760
 ancient people as very naive, like that they were kind of stupid and they didn't really

69
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
 get it.

70
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,600
 They so easily believed in the resurrection.

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,680
 But I want you to notice with Mary Magdalene, her first thought is not Jesus' body is gone,

72
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,960
 he must have risen.

73
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,880
 Her first thought is that somebody must have stolen the body of Jesus.

74
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,360
 Because ancient people also didn't easily believe in the resurrection.

75
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,960
 It was not their first thought, just like it's not our first thought.

76
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,300
 Now who might have stolen the body?

77
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
 Why did she think that?

78
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,040
 Maybe it was some of the Roman soldiers, maybe it was some of the religious leaders, maybe

79
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,000
 it was just grave robbers.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,980
 That was a thing during that time because there was valuable things in the graves.

81
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,960
 And so she assumes that and she tells Peter and John, and this is my favorite part, or

82
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:01,360
 one of my favorite parts, they run to the tomb and were told that John, who's the disciple

83
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,080
 whom Jesus loved, that he ran faster, he got there first.

84
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,520
 And I actually was searching for a meme, there was a ton of memes on this.

85
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,480
 I couldn't find the one I was looking for but I saw this comment and I was like, you

86
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,800
 know, it just sums this up perfectly.

87
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,880
 It says, "This was the most unnecessary flex of all time."

88
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
 Right?

89
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
 Where somebody's like showing off.

90
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,680
 It's like, "Hey, I was faster than Peter."

91
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,440
 And by the way, Peter was also an older man so he like outran the old man, right?

92
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,560
 So but why is that in there?

93
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
 Why is that in there?

94
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,240
 Well, because it's the account of what actually happened.

95
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,840
 So Peter did outrun, not Peter, John did outrun Peter.

96
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,560
 So he's just reporting what happened even though we like making little jokes about that.

97
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,280
 And so when John gets there, he stoops down, he looks into the tomb and he sees linen strips

98
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
 lying there.

99
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,560
 And he doesn't go inside, perhaps because Peter had more seniority among the disciples,

100
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,360
 you know, was a leader among the disciples.

101
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,120
 But it might also be because who knows what would await him in that tomb.

102
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,240
 You know, this beloved Jesus, this leader, and what might he find, especially if the

103
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,280
 tomb had been raided.

104
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,120
 You know, so I mean, there are grievings though.

105
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,760
 This, you know, this was not something you easily, I don't know if you would easily run

106
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
 into a grave.

107
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,320
 You know, so but then Peter comes, totally different personality.

108
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,040
 He just rushes right in.

109
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
 That's Peter.

110
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,080
 He just rushes into situations.

111
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,440
 And he says right away what he thinks.

112
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:46,600
 And so, and this is where we find that little detail that so often is overlooked that I

113
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,080
 want to highlight to you.

114
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,160
 So in kind of towards the end of verse six and verse seven, he says, he saw the linen

115
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,600
 cloths lying there and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus's head.

116
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,440
 So that detail that is not mentioned anywhere else besides the gospel of John is the face

117
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
 cloth.

118
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,800
 So that's the only place where that's mentioned.

119
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,240
 Now there's also a different way of calling that you can call it a burial shroud.

120
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,560
 So that's the first thing I want to highlight.

121
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,240
 But the second thing, they kind of go together is that face cloth that, you know, had been

122
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,440
 on Jesus's head was not lying with the linen cloth, but folded up and placed by itself.

123
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,760
 So I have an image here, you know, for you to look at of the linen cloth being folded

124
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
 up.

125
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,040
 Kind of get an idea of what that might have looked like.

126
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,640
 And this burial shroud right there.

127
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:51,200
 And now the question we have to ask ourselves is why does John include these details?

128
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,360
 Such a little detail, but why does he decide to record this?

129
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,760
 Well, I think the first thing we need to do is we need to understand what a burial shroud

130
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
 is.

131
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,400
 Well, a burial shroud for one was, well, first they wrapped the body with linen cloths.

132
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,040
 It was not mummification, not like Egyptians, but they still wrapped the whole body.

133
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:19,200
 And then at the end, they placed the burial shroud around the head, like tightly wrapped.

134
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,680
 And that burial shroud symbolizes three things.

135
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,720
 First it's to hide the face from other observers and to give the person who has passed away

136
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
 dignity.

137
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,800
 Secondly, it was placed around the head if there was wounds or anything else to cover

138
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
 that up.

139
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,000
 And then finally, and that's the most important reason or what the symbolizes is that the

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,720
 person actually had truly died.

141
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,960
 They had passed from life to death.

142
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,760
 And so that's what that shroud symbolizes.

143
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:59,760
 So John, he draws our attention to the seemingly small detail.

144
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,000
 And what he's saying with that is Jesus truly died.

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,120
 The execution from the Romans on the cross, it was successful.

146
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,920
 He was not unconscious and then later on woke up.

147
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,720
 He was not just falling asleep.

148
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,440
 You know, Jesus had truly died.

149
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,520
 You would not wrap this burial cloth around a person's head, you know, if they're still

150
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,400
 breathing.

151
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,020
 So death had fully taken its course.

152
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,300
 And so what might seem like a small detail of a much larger narrative of the resurrection

153
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:48,540
 of Jesus, it's actually the central point of this whole resurrection story.

154
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,600
 But to understand that we actually need to take a step back and we need to take a further

155
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:01,280
 step back in the biblical story and we need to look at this larger, broader story of humanity.

156
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,500
 So let me do that with you.

157
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:11,960
 About 700 years before, you know, the empty tomb where Peter and John are standing, Israel

158
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:19,480
 experienced the most traumatic, painful thing they had gone through.

159
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,040
 And what happened was that Babylon had attacked Israel.

160
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,680
 They had attacked Israel and they had conquered Jerusalem.

161
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,360
 They had destroyed the temple.

162
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,760
 They had killed many people and then they took people captive and they deported them

163
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,880
 to Babylon.

164
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:49,300
 Now all of this was a consequence of Israel's ongoing sin.

165
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:56,080
 There was just these cycles of sin and rebellion against God and it didn't stop.

166
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,640
 But I actually want to take us even further back to the beginning of the Bible, to Genesis

167
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:08,120
 3 in the story of humanity, where humanity, you know, they're not supposed to eat the

168
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,400
 fruit.

169
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,600
 God tells them not to.

170
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
 They rebel against God.

171
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
 They do it anyhow.

172
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:22,180
 And the relationship between God and people is impacted by sin.

173
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:28,420
 So the relationship between God and us and God, us and each other, us and ourselves,

174
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,760
 us and creation, sin runs now right through all of it.

175
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,100
 And there's brokenness in all of those relationships.

176
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,600
 And so the result is clear, right?

177
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,820
 Before the fall, before sin entered the world, these relationships, they flourished, they

178
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,820
 thrived.

179
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,620
 There was wholeness, shalom.

180
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,180
 There was peace.

181
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,340
 And in all those relations between us and God, us and other people, even with ourselves,

182
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,860
 we have peace with ourselves and us and creation.

183
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,940
 But now that sin had entered the world, you know, all those relationships are ruptured

184
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:12,780
 and we just experience just this brokenness, this pain, this heaviness, and in all of those

185
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,140
 relationships.

186
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,880
 And so then if you keep reading in the Bible from Genesis 4 onwards, it's just the story

187
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,140
 of the sin and this brokenness and this pain unfolding and moving forward.

188
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:30,860
 Now there's still good things, but there is a lot of pain and there is a lot of brokenness.

189
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,200
 And so we all find ourselves entangled in the story of humanity, every one of us, every

190
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,320
 single person.

191
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,660
 We all have sat in the consequences of sin.

192
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,720
 You know, we all have sat on it.

193
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,200
 You know, whether it's somebody did something to us, a word that was spoken that was hurtful

194
00:13:52,200 --> 00:14:00,960
 and painful, whether it was an action done to us and we just felt the brokenness of that.

195
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,040
 I feel like a lot of times it's also what we did, right?

196
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,680
 That we sit in our own brokenness where we did something, where we said something, a

197
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:15,100
 word we cannot take back, and that just has ruptured relationship.

198
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
 And so we all have felt that.

199
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,480
 And to take that even a little bit further, because sometimes we feel like, you know,

200
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,320
 sin is like just these big things like murdering somebody, you know, and it's not really my

201
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,880
 issue or sin doesn't really run through me in these relationships.

202
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:40,160
 But just imagine your life on a video displayed right here in front of everyone, every detail

203
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,080
 of your life.

204
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:49,600
 You know, everything that you said, everything that you thought, like with subtitles.

205
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,760
 And I'm convinced every one of us would be embarrassed by that video.

206
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,880
 Let's never do this, okay?

207
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
 Let's never do this.

208
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,600
 I know I would be.

209
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,080
 I would be deeply embarrassed if you would see my video.

210
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,160
 I know.

211
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,960
 And we're not even needing to talk about going back our whole lives.

212
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,480
 We can just go back a month.

213
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,760
 That's probably already enough to deeply embarrass us.

214
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,920
 You know, so what this means is that sin really runs through all of our lives.

215
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,160
 It's just that there's a brokenness, there's a fallenness, there's a pain where we are

216
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:26,240
 just stuck in the cycle of just, you know, hurting others, being hurt, doing things we

217
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,720
 actually don't want to do, but we do them nonetheless.

218
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:41,720
 Now going back to the biblical story in the Old Testament, it's a story of people longing

219
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,280
 to be restored with God, longing for that, that what has been disconnected, be reconnected

220
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,120
 with God.

221
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:56,640
 And it's also the story of God desiring to reconnect with people, to redeem his people,

222
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,060
 to reverse this brokenness.

223
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:10,040
 And all of this brings us back to this climax, to the story of where Babylon, Egypt, oh my

224
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,640
 gosh, naming all the nations here, where Israel, there you go, I found it.

225
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:27,200
 Where Israel is sitting just in the trauma of their sin having taken full course and

226
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,040
 they're just sitting in their brokenness, you know, in Babylon.

227
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,140
 And there's reflection and there's just darkness, there's hopelessness.

228
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:45,920
 And into that moment, God begins to speak about the work that he's going to do, about

229
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,880
 the transformation that he is going to bring.

230
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,420
 And he does that through the prophets.

231
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,920
 And one of the prophets he does that through is the prophet Isaiah.

232
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,120
 And he gives Isaiah this vision.

233
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:09,280
 And in this vision, Isaiah goes back to Jerusalem, to this hill, this mountain in Jerusalem.

234
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,160
 And it's the mountain where the temple used to stand on, but it was destroyed.

235
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,120
 And Isaiah doesn't just go back to the ruins of the past in this vision, but it is also

236
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:26,680
 a vision of a future where God is doing something new, where God is doing something powerful,

237
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,780
 where God is doing something beautiful on that very mountain.

238
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,840
 And so I want to show you this picture that God gives Isaiah.

239
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,000
 So we're in Isaiah 25, starting in verse six, and it says this.

240
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 On this mountain, the Lord Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet

241
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,180
 of aged wine, the best of meats and the finest of wines.

242
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,320
 On this mountain, he will destroy the shroud that unfolds all people, the sheet that covers

243
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,000
 all nations.

244
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,160
 He will swallow up death forever.

245
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,140
 The sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from all faces.

246
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,160
 He will remove his people's disgrace from all the earth.

247
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,920
 The Lord has spoken in that day.

248
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,920
 They will say, "Surely this is our God.

249
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,740
 We trusted in him and he saved us.

250
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,740
 This is the Lord.

251
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,560
 We trusted in him.

252
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,440
 Let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation."

253
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,520
 Now, do you catch that?

254
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,640
 Do you see what is happening here?

255
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:44,860
 So 700 years later, Jesus is on this very mountain.

256
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,220
 He has died and then he has risen.

257
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,740
 And Isaiah has this vision of that very same mountain.

258
00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:00,540
 And he sees it as a place where God is going to destroy this burial shroud that wraps up

259
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,220
 everyone, the sheet that covers all nations.

260
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,620
 Isn't that amazing?

261
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,460
 I find that amazing.

262
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,700
 Now what a powerful picture Isaiah paints here of humanity and where it finds itself,

263
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
 right?

264
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:25,980
 He talks about that the shroud that unfolds all peoples and covers all nations.

265
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,340
 It's as if like humanity has these linen strips just wrapped all around them.

266
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:37,020
 It's as if this burial shroud is around our faces and we're just not free to move.

267
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:43,720
 We can't break free from these grave clothes that we're wearing.

268
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,660
 And we're not able to be the person that we want to be.

269
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,660
 We can sense it.

270
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,540
 We know it in our hearts.

271
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,660
 We're not fully who we want to be.

272
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:59,060
 And we're also not the person that God created us to be.

273
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,940
 And in the New Testament in Romans 6, 23, it kind of explains this condition.

274
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:10,040
 It says, "The wages of sin is death."

275
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,480
 And really that's before there was sin, there was no death.

276
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,340
 When sin has entered the world, death has entered the world.

277
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,460
 And death's purpose is to destroy.

278
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,940
 Sin's purpose wants to bring death to relationships, death through our relationship with God, death

279
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,860
 in all aspects of life.

280
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,460
 And that's as if, you know, Isaiah gives us this picture of we are wrapped up, we are

281
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:42,820
 entangled and we are just captive, you know, by these clothes and by these shroud.

282
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,140
 And sin enfolds us.

283
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,140
 It's heavy on us.

284
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,400
 It weighs on us.

285
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,060
 And its only goal is to bring us down.

286
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,140
 But this is why this prophetic vision from Isaiah is so important.

287
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:04,260
 Despite the darkness of humanity's sin that has taken place ever since the fall, Isaiah

288
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,540
 pictures a divine intervention.

289
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:13,380
 You know, God does not leave us in this darkness, but he has come to liberate us, to set us

290
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,300
 free from this darkness, to break us free.

291
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:25,020
 God who has the power to step in, and as it says in verse 7 in Isaiah 25, to destroy the

292
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:31,980
 shroud that unfolds all people, the sheet that covers all nations.

293
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,980
 And note what it says here.

294
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,100
 It says all people, all nations.

295
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,600
 It doesn't just say Israel.

296
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,720
 So this is a greater work of liberation that God will do.

297
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,700
 So God's rescue is for all people in all nations, for anyone who trusts, who believes in him.

298
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,980
 That is the powerful message of Easter.

299
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,060
 And Isaiah shows us in this passage this great reversal.

300
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:09,000
 You know, there is a turning point in the story of humanity and of our world where sin

301
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,860
 and death are no longer the end of the story.

302
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:20,360
 You know that he will remove the shroud that unfolds his people, the burial shroud that

303
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,940
 has been weighing us down.

304
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,700
 And it's this picture of that he will wipe away every tear.

305
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,420
 He will remove our shame.

306
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,660
 Isn't that beautiful?

307
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:39,900
 He will remove our disgrace and our shame, and he will provide for us salvation to all

308
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,000
 who believe in him.

309
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,640
 And so now this brings us back to John and John and Peter standing in the tomb.

310
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,180
 And John tells us that the, in verse seven, that the burial shroud was not lying with

311
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:03,700
 the linen cloth, but was folded up in a place by itself.

312
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
 So did you catch that?

313
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,780
 It was folded up, the burial shroud.

314
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,100
 It was no longer wrapped around Jesus.

315
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:19,960
 What John is declaring in a small detail is this very prophecy from Isaiah has been fulfilled.

316
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:26,180
 The shroud that has unfolded all people has been removed through the death and resurrection

317
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,460
 of Jesus.

318
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,260
 The power of sin and death has been broken over our lives.

319
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,820
 Wow, that's amazing.

320
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,780
 That is absolutely amazing.

321
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:46,540
 So Jesus' resurrection means that sin is defeated, that the power of death is no longer the final

322
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,740
 story.

323
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,080
 It doesn't have to be your final story.

324
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,460
 So as Jesus said on the cross, it is finished.

325
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:06,540
 You notice this, all this brokenness and separation and hurt and pain, you know, it has come to

326
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:15,660
 an end when Jesus died and rose and he removes the burial shroud and he creates a path for

327
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:21,340
 all who place their faith in him, for all who believe in him, you know, to have new

328
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,500
 life in Jesus.

329
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
 Can I get an amen?

330
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
 Amen.

331
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 Amen.

332
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
 Thank you.

333
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:35,140
 So Jesus has won the decisive victory to liberate us from our sin and to break us free from

334
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,040
 the shroud that has unfolded us.

335
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:47,180
 And you know, it's in the small details that we can so easily overlook, you know, that

336
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:53,180
 we actually find a beautiful picture of the meaning of Easter.

337
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,060
 Isn't that beautiful?

338
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:00,700
 That this burial shroud has been removed, these clothes, they could not contain Jesus.

339
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,380
 He bursts out of them.

340
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,020
 He has broken free.

341
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,060
 He folds it up neatly, sets it aside.

342
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,220
 I'm done with this.

343
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,300
 And you know, it's also like there's all this chaos.

344
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,300
 I love that.

345
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,500
 So Jesus apparently is neat, right?

346
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,680
 He's a neat, neat guy.

347
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,700
 So he brings out in chaos, he brings order.

348
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,220
 You know, in chaos, he brings order.

349
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,380
 So he wants to bring order into your chaotic life.

350
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:38,020
 He also wants to remove this shroud from your face for anyone who places their trust in

351
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,420
 him, for anyone who believes in him.

352
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:45,300
 And he wants to remove it and set it aside so that you can be free, that you can live

353
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:52,580
 the life that God has created for you and that sin and death is no longer the end of

354
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,200
 your story.

355
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,080
 So I want to invite the worship team to come up.

356
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,280
 And Jesus's resurrection, the burial shroud of death is lifted off the faces of all those

357
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,760
 who believe in him.

358
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:20,040
 Jesus's resurrection is a joyful declaration that a new age, a new time has begun.

359
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:27,820
 It's a time where death is replaced with life, where mourning and pain, they're replaced

360
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:37,260
 with dancing and with joy, where tears are replaced with praise.

361
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:43,700
 Now we still know the impact of sin in our lives.

362
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:50,640
 We still know that even when we know Jesus, but it is no longer the end of our story.

363
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:59,040
 And so I want to actually extend an invitation to anyone who would like to place their faith

364
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:06,340
 in Jesus, you know, who would like to experience this being set free from these grave clothes

365
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,460
 that entangle us and experience this new life that Jesus gave.

366
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,340
 John, at the beginning of his gospel, he says, he's talking about Jesus, "To all who did

367
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:26,420
 receive him, to those who believed in him, he gave the right to become children of God."

368
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:35,860
 So I just want to give this opportunity to receive and to believe in Jesus and to experience

369
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,900
 what it means to be a child of God.

370
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,580
 That's why we're celebrating Easter today, and I want you to join in on the celebration

371
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,780
 with us.

372
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:49,160
 So the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to lead you in a prayer.

373
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,780
 And if you want to become a Christian, if you want to receive this new life that Jesus

374
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,900
 gives, and the way you can make this your own is basically you repeat it in your heart

375
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,540
 quietly.

376
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,820
 And you know, you just talk yourself to Jesus, but I'll give you some guidance on how to

377
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,860
 do that.

378
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,700
 And so I'll do that right now.

379
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,700
 I'll lead us in a prayer.

380
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,340
 Let's pray.

381
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:23,660
 Jesus, thank you so much that you love us so much.

382
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:31,420
 I now want to turn away from all the bad stuff in my life.

383
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:37,220
 And if there's any sins that you need to ask for forgiveness for right now, actually take

384
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,940
 a moment to do that.

385
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:56,860
 Just tell Jesus, "I'm sorry for these things."

386
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,580
 And let me continue with a prayer.

387
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:11,740
 Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me so that I can be set free and forgiven.

388
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:21,340
 I now receive your forgiveness and I place my trust in you.

389
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:31,820
 Jesus, will you come into my heart by your Holy Spirit and will you make me your child

390
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,580
 forever?

391
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,580
 Thank you, Jesus.

392
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,020
 Amen.

393
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,460
 Amen.

394
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:46,220
 Now, I want to ask if anyone has prayed this prayer, if you can give me a little wave.

395
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,900
 I can't really see much anyhow, but yeah.

396
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:57,740
 So if you've prayed this prayer, if you made us your own, this really is a turning point.

397
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:03,540
 Sometimes you feel immediately, this is just changing you, this weight lifted off you.

398
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,780
 Other times it comes over time.

399
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,660
 We would love to encourage you in that step that you've taken and encourage you in that

400
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,720
 journey.

401
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,000
 So if you would share with us, we can do that.

402
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,300
 But I want to invite right now everyone to stand and we'd love to pray over all of us.

403
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:38,120
 Jesus, we thank you so much that you came to this earth to rescue, to redeem us, that

404
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,580
 you love us so much.

405
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,580
 We thank you that you laid down your life, though you were innocent, you didn't do anything

406
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:52,140
 wrong, but you took, you bore our sin on the cross so that we can be forgiven, that we

407
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:57,260
 can have new life in you, that we can have resurrection life in you.

408
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:02,060
 And Jesus, I pray that today on this Easter where we celebrate that you died and rose,

409
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,860
 where we celebrate that you removed that burial shroud that has been weighing us down for

410
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,420
 anyone who believes in you.

411
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:15,260
 Lord, I pray that you fill us up again with your joy, with this joy of the Holy Spirit

412
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:20,340
 of this work that you have done, that you have overcome sin and that you have overcome

413
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,340
 death.

414
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,580
 Lord, I also want to pray for anyone who is struggling.

415
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,600
 Just because we're Jesus followers, just because we're Christian doesn't mean that we don't

416
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,100
 still struggle with things, that we don't struggle with sin and brokenness, though.

417
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,780
 But I just pray for your grace right now.

418
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,900
 Thank you that your forgiveness is always available.

419
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,680
 And I pray that you would just flood our lives, that you would flood us with your grace.

420
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,300
 And so we give you all the praise, all the glory, and we thank you for this beautiful

421
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
 day.

422
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,140
 We remember that you have risen, Jesus.

423
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,580
 I pray this in your name.

424
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,100
 Amen.

425
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,940
 Amen.
