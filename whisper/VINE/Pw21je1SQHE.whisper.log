[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   It's good to see you guys.
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.040]   How is everyone?
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.200]   How are you at home?
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.700]   You know, I wonder whether you know
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.000]   that what we're doing right here in this moment
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   is the most audacious, provocative, transformative,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.880]   powerful, creative thing that we could ever do.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.560]   That right now in this moment,
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.920]   there is a power amongst us.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.400]   That there is an authority that's here
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.800]   that has been God created and that is God sustained.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.320]   That there is a movement in this room
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.080]   of God's purposes and his promises
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.360]   that no force, no demonic entity,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720]   that nothing could ever come against
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.920]   to hold it back or to contain it.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.880]   I wonder if you realize that in this moment right now,
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.000]   as we gather together in this physical room
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.400]   and online with all the people that are watching,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.480]   that we're doing something that has been purchased
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.720]   through the shedding of blood for almost 2000 years.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680]   That the privilege of gathering in this moment
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.680]   has been forged in the fire of martyrdom and sacrifice.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.800]   That this moment of our gathering together
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.400]   has come through two millennium
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.400]   of the worst political, social, and economic history
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.880]   that you could ever imagine.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.680]   That what we're doing right now
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.280]   has with it such power and authority
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.000]   that God had decided it would happen
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.640]   right before the beginning of creation.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.120]   That it's the reason why Jesus actually came to earth
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.720]   to die on the cross.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.520]   That it's the reason why the Holy Spirit
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.580]   is at work in the world right now.
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.840]   So that when God's people gather together,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.600]   something shifts and takes place in the world around it.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.960]   I mean, I wonder if you've ever thought
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.320]   that what we can do together is far greater
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.460]   than what we would ever be able to achieve on our own.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.160]   That the Bible would say, "When two or more are gathered,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.580]   "Jesus is with them."
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.520]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.000]   Not when you're on your own.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.400]   Now we know that when we're on our own,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.740]   Jesus is with us too, amen?
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.320]   But the Bible has this force,
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.680]   has this suggestion that is audacious
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.520]   that when we gather together,
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.760]   we should come to expect the kingdom of earth
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.240]   on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.000]   You know, Jesus spoke of what we're doing
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.480]   in this moment as this.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   He said, "This will be my body on earth."
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.000]   I want you to think about that for a second.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.400]   My body on earth.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.440]   What that means is if anybody in the world
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.320]   wants to know what Jesus is like,
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.560]   wants to see Jesus,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.920]   wants to understand what Jesus said and did,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.480]   wants to know how to act like Jesus,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.600]   wants to experience something of the power
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.480]   and the authority of Jesus,
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.740]   they should go to their local church.
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.280]   Like the local church should be the manifestation
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.280]   of the risen Jesus so that when anybody comes
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   into a gathering like this,
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.560]   they should leave with nothing less
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.720]   than a profound encounter with the risen Jesus.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.120]   That what we get to do here is not just come together
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.380]   and sing some pretty nice songs,
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.440]   but we get to model a new humanity to the world.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.720]   That we get to show people what the risen Jesus
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.000]   has done for them.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.760]   And in showing them that,
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.440]   they might have a new and fresh vision for life.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.080]   I'm the only one who's excited about this.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.920]   Are you with me?
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.920]   That this moment is literally world changing.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.640]   So let me ask you again,
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.520]   do you realize that what we're doing right now
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.180]   is the most audacious, provocative, transformative,
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.220]   powerful, creative thing that we could ever do?
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.440]   That my friends is the church.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.960]   It may not always feel like that's the church,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.360]   but that's what Jesus died for.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.920]   And the little bit of passion that I've just tried
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.160]   to describe the church to you this morning
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.120]   is just a fraction of the passion that sat on Paul's heart
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.200]   as he penned the letter to the church in Philippi
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   that we've come to call Philippians.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.960]   Because Paul was so passionate that a church like it was
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.160]   in this city of Philippi could come to understand
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.820]   that their public witness of faith
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.920]   could have such a profound impact on their society
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.760]   that he writes this letter specifically to inspire them
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.040]   that the way in which they live together
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.580]   will model a fresh and new vision for life
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.780]   for everybody else.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.160]   Philippians is Paul's most personal and intimate letter
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.720]   'cause he loved the church in that city.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.160]   But it was a church that was perhaps
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.100]   out of the whole Greco-Roman empire,
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.340]   the one that was under more persecution
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.680]   than any other church in the whole of that empire.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.720]   Out of every single church that Paul ever planted,
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.840]   the one in Philippi had the hardest yards to walk
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.960]   when it came to their relationship
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.200]   with the authorities around them.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.920]   And Paul writes this letter to them in prison himself.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.520]   I want you to follow this.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.520]   Paul's in prison for preaching the gospel,
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.740]   writing a letter to a church that is deeply suffering
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.880]   for their faith through the oppression
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.520]   of the authorities around them.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.720]   And he's writing to them knowing the pain of that.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.680]   And he writes them and says,
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   "I want you to shine like stars in the universe.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.720]   I want you, despite the suffering
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.420]   that you're experiencing right now,
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.880]   to know the deep abiding wonder of living a life
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.920]   that's worthy of the gospel."
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.560]   See, Paul understood that salvation,
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.760]   yes, of course, had an individual impact.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.000]   He wrote and taught a theology of salvation
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.960]   for the individual coming to Christ,
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.480]   having this change in our relationship with God individually
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.680]   and that change creating for us an ability
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.920]   for us to know eternal life and hope.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.680]   Paul understood that,
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.520]   but in that he always taught beyond just the individual.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.680]   He always taught that if you came to Christ
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.120]   as an individual, yes, you might be reconciled to God.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.320]   Yes, you might have this eternal life with you,
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.440]   but you need to understand that you're saved
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.640]   in order to have a different spirit in you.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.920]   Paul would call it a new creation.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.080]   And as a different spirit,
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.960]   you need to then come and work
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.180]   and live in a different community.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.040]   See, we've been talking here at the Vine this whole year
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.720]   about what it is to have a different spirit.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.880]   And the reason why we're now shifting our focus
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.680]   to a seven-week study on the book of Philippians
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.440]   is 'cause in this book, we see Paul theologically go,
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.920]   if you've got a different spirit,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.200]   then you need to live in a different community,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.320]   that there needs to be a way for you to now live in a way
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.240]   where together you do something that's more powerful
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.400]   than you would ever do on your own.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.520]   So in April to May, I preached to you
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.360]   about what it is to have a different spirit for yourself,
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.360]   what it is for you to live with a different spirit
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.240]   in this time of Hong Kong's important history.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.560]   From here until November, I wanna now teach you,
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.440]   yes, we've got a different spirit in us,
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.280]   but we also need to have a different community.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.720]   We also need to be a different church
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.080]   for the hour that we're in, because when we get saved,
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.200]   we don't just get saved
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.120]   into a personal relationship with Jesus,
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.520]   we get saved into a community called the church.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.760]   And we get saved into this wonderful gift
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.440]   of now being able to walk together
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.320]   in the profound and provocative and audacious reality
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.380]   that we get to show the world what Jesus looks like.
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.120]   Are you with me?
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:35.040]   In other words, we're saved to be a part
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.500]   of what I like to call an alternative society.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.600]   Not something that's up on a hill
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.000]   removed from everything else,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.800]   but something planted right in the midst
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.960]   of all the other societies of this world
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.760]   that gets to model a different way of life.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.400]   Jesus spoke of this alternative society
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.280]   as the kingdom of God.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.160]   Paul writes of it in Philippians as the ecclesia.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.600]   We've come to commonly call it the church.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.400]   What I wanna do over the next seven weeks
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.280]   is recapture for us the beautiful, profound vision
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.080]   that Paul had for the local church.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.400]   But by focusing in on the book of Philippians,
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.240]   as we look at one particular church
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.520]   in oppressive Greco-Roman empire,
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.840]   I want us to understand that the original vision
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.200]   that the New Testament has
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.880]   for what the gathering of God's people is and all about
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.560]   might have something important to say
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.720]   to what the gathering might look like
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.480]   or need to look like for us in our city of Hong Kong today.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.320]   Are you with me?
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.720]   So let me tell you a little bit today about Philippi
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.520]   and then about the church that was planted there.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:51.480]   Philippi as a city was located in the northeast of Greece.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.640]   The map here will show you.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.560]   It's the little city that's at the top of the map there,
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.520]   kind of adjacent to a city called Necropolis
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.160]   that was a city that eventually got consumed
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.360]   within Philippi itself.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   It was founded in 350 BC by the Thassos.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.320]   And soon after they founded the city,
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.680]   they called on the leader of Macedon at the time,
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.880]   his name was Philip II,
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.200]   to come and help them to defend their city
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.960]   against foreign invaders.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.600]   Soon afterwards, Philip renamed the city after himself,
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.440]   and that city became one of the wealthiest
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.880]   that there was in the land at the time,
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.320]   largely because it had gold mines in its region,
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.320]   and Philip mined the gold and then sold it around the world.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.120]   In 186 BC, the Romans took over the city,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.680]   just like Romans did in those days.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.040]   And they came in, they took that city
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.360]   because they saw it as a strategic port
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.280]   for trade amongst themselves.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.480]   And from 186 onwards, that city was predominantly Roman
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.880]   in its understanding and the way it lived its life.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.520]   In fact, in 43 BC, an important moment happened
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.440]   in the Roman Civil War.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.880]   An important battle takes place right in Philippi
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.320]   between Octavian on the one side, representing the empire,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.960]   and a bunch of other people on the other side
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.120]   who were representing the rebellion against that empire.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.440]   And Octavian has a famous and successful victory over them,
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.680]   drives the rebels out of Philippi,
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.080]   and Octavian takes his personal kind of authority
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.920]   over the city at that time.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.280]   By 31 BC, Octavian does something really important.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.080]   He realizes that he needs to attract wealth
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.920]   to come down from Italy to be in Philippi.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.960]   He wants to fill Philippi with a whole bunch of Italians
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.800]   who are now living as expats there, essentially.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.040]   And so what Octavian does is something very clever.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.880]   He calls Philippi, he re-names, well, not names it,
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.080]   but he reestablishes it as what's known as eis italium.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.760]   What that meant was in Italy.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.800]   So anyone now living in Philippi would have the same rights,
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.320]   the same citizenship, would pay the same taxes
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.880]   as if they were actually living in Italy.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.480]   What this meant was if you're a wealthy person in Italy,
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.760]   Philippi was a great place for you to come and settle
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.840]   to grow your wealth,
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.400]   because it would be exactly the same tax district,
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.160]   exactly the same laws, exactly the same citizenship status
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.720]   as if you'd never left Italy at all.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.640]   And this brilliant move by Octavian
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.440]   actually doubled Philippi in its size over the 100 years
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.920]   between when he decreed the city to be like that
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.840]   to when Paul eventually visits it about 100 years later.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   What's central to Philippi is that move.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.920]   It was a place of Roman citizenship.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.920]   And living in Philippi came with a great sense of pride
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.640]   that you were exactly like you were living in Italy itself.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.920]   So the same laws, the same powers, the same tax district,
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.400]   not only that, but the same religious fervor.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.600]   And in the Greek Roman empire,
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.160]   that religion was towards all the Greek or Roman gods,
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.100]   but at the top of that was worship of Caesar.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.640]   This is really important.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.080]   That by the time that Paul arrives in the city,
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.560]   emperor worship is the central religion of that city.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.480]   And they're worshiping Octavian,
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.360]   who eventually became known as Caesar Augustus.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.080]   And although he had long died by the time of Paul's presence,
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.080]   the city still revolved around him.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.520]   You can find inscriptions in Philippi that say this,
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.320]   "To the worship of Caesar Augustus, our Lord and savior.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.840]   "To Augustus, who is the creator
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.280]   "and sustainer of all things.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.280]   "To Augustus, who has and holds all eternal life."
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.720]   So I wonder if you could imagine
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.120]   what it would have been like for Paul
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.240]   to arrive in this city with the gospel in his heart.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.480]   He arrives into a place where the people are worshiping Caesar
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.760]   with titles like Lord and savior, sustainer and creator,
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.480]   the one who holds eternal life.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.560]   And there's Paul saying, "Hang on a second."
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.080]   That this is the very antithesis
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.440]   of what the gospel was all about.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.120]   And Paul arrives in the city with this dangerous new idea
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.600]   that it's not actually Caesar who is Lord and savior,
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.800]   but actually a carpenter from a city called Nazareth.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.920]   That actually the one who is the creator
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.160]   and sustainer of all is Jesus, not Caesar Augustus.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.240]   That actually the place where you find your citizenship,
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.680]   listen to this, is not Italy, it is heaven.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:33.240]   And Paul begins to formulate the gospel in his heart
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.800]   and he stands dangerously against all of the philosophy
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.080]   and the social structures of Philippi at that time.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.160]   Can you get a sense of the courage
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.120]   Paul must've had to go there?
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.760]   Are you with me still?
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.280]   This is all important that you carry with you
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.880]   because I wanna talk to you now
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   about the church that he founded there.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:58.040]   Paul received a vision to go to Philippi
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.840]   from the Holy Spirit whilst he was asleep one night.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.840]   It's called the Macedonian call.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.640]   You can read about it in Acts 15 and 16.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.360]   And he shows up there in about 49 AD.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.960]   And he goes there and the first person
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.280]   he leads to Jesus is a woman.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.960]   Her name is Lydia and he meets her
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.240]   just outside the gates of the city by a stream.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.120]   And she's washing and preparing the cloths that she has made.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.040]   She is a merchant in purple cloths.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.920]   And purple cloths in those days were incredibly expensive
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.240]   because of the dye that was used to make them.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.200]   So they were only ever purchased by wealthy people,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.320]   likely the people that ruled
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.480]   and were over the higher elite classes of the city.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.640]   This was her job.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.440]   She would have been wealthy herself,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.520]   making wealthy clothes for wealthy people.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.040]   Essentially, she was the Gucci of Philippi.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.880]   Are you with me?
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.400]   And he brings her to Jesus.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.920]   He tells her that it's not Augustus who is Lord and Savior,
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.440]   that it is this person, Jesus,
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.680]   who's died and risen for her
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   so that she could have reconciliation with God
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.720]   and know what it is to have the fullness of life.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.080]   And she comes to faith, her whole family,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.200]   and the church starts in her home.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.480]   Now, this church is an amazing thing.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.960]   It's filled with all different kinds of people.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.200]   There's wealthy and then there's the poor.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.840]   There are free people and there are slaves.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.520]   There are the old and they are the young.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.520]   And by the time that Paul writes his letter
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.800]   to the church in Philippi,
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.100]   that church has grown to a tremendous 30 people.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.200]   I know you thought I was gonna say more than that,
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.480]   didn't you?
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.680]   Isn't it funny how we, when we think about church,
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.680]   especially if you come to the Vine,
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.760]   you think of church something like this, you know?
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.920]   I don't know, we're 2,000 people over the whole Sunday,
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.600]   something like that in normal times.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.680]   At the moment, we're 1,000 people over the Sunday at 50%.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.320]   It's large, it's big.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.080]   The church that Paul was passionate about,
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.320]   the one he was writing to,
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.320]   the one that was struggling under great oppression,
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.640]   that church, 30 people in a house,
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.920]   slaves and frees, wealthy and poor, young and old together.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.880]   There was no other society or gathering of people
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.960]   that looked like this in any other part
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.680]   of the Greek or Roman empire.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.840]   It was only in a church where you would get the slave
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.240]   and the free to be equal together.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.160]   This is an alternative society planted in the midst.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.640]   And Paul's writing to them with such passion on his heart
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.480]   'cause he's saying,
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.020]   "You need to have a witness for Jesus in this time."
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.160]   You see, there were two things
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.440]   that were happening for the church.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.920]   You guys all tracking with me?
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.720]   Okay, two things were happening with the church.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.380]   Here's the first one, I've already mentioned it,
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.760]   extreme persecution.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.680]   Paul understood this persecution
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.240]   'cause he had been persecuted himself in Philippi.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.520]   In fact, he had been sent to prison in Philippi.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.360]   It's an amazing story.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.080]   You can read it later in Acts 16.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.480]   But there's Paul and Silas.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.440]   They're walking through the town one day
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.880]   and a slave girl behind them starts to cry out,
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.560]   "These are servants of the most high God."
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.100]   Now, we're told in scripture
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.280]   that she had a demonic spirit in her
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.180]   and that men were abusing her with that demonic spirit
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.480]   so that she could be a fortune teller and make them money.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.400]   And after two or three days of Paul and Silas walking around
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.220]   and having this woman following behind them going,
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.040]   "These are the servants of the most high."
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.760]   Paul is so annoyed that he turns around
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.800]   and he says, "In Jesus' name, be gone."
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.240]   And the demon leaves her straight away.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.280]   And because the demon leaves her,
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.240]   she's no longer a use to the men
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.640]   who are making money out of her,
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.240]   which is the complaint that ends up putting Paul
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.500]   and Silas in prison.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.600]   Now, I haven't got time for this,
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.680]   but can I tell you a story?
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.920]   I'm just gonna tell it anyway.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.280]   I've done this myself.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.980]   Yeah, so here's the story.
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.260]   I was on the bus once.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.760]   The 962.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.160]   I got on from Central and I was going all the way to Tuen Mun.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.320]   Anyone taking that bus ride?
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.360]   It's a long bus ride.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.800]   It's like an hour and 40 minutes.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.920]   Everybody falls asleep, right?
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.160]   Like everybody's there kind of trying
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.040]   to mind their own business.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.080]   You know what it's like awkwardly on a public bus.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.360]   We've all got our headphones on.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.720]   We're trying to kind of keep things on our own and whatever.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.000]   Anyway, about 20 minutes into the journey,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.520]   there's this man about three rows in front of me
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.400]   who suddenly starts freaking out
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.160]   and shouting and screaming.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.920]   And he's really aggressive.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.980]   And he's talking about how everybody on the bus
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.500]   is gonna be taken over by zombies.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.340]   I kid you not.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.660]   And he's really freaking people out.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.900]   And I've had enough experience with demonic manifestations
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.860]   in my pastoral life over 20 years
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.280]   that I can discern the difference
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.940]   between what is maybe a mental health episode
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.100]   and what is a demonic thing.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.940]   And I knew straight away this was a demonic manifestation.
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.900]   And so as this man is shouting at everybody
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.660]   at the top of his lungs about zombies,
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.740]   I shout, "In the name of Jesus, be gone."
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.220]   And immediately he falls asleep.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.560]   Like straight away.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.620]   It was the most amazing thing.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.420]   And I was like, "Whoa, that was cool."
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.620]   The woman next to me was like, "What just happened?"
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.980]   And I was like, "Yes, I have no idea."
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.380]   Anyway, I told her a little bit about what just happened
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.500]   and Jesus and everything.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.460]   And I'd like to say she came to faith.
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.420]   I think she left the bus freaked out even more,
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.460]   but it was an amazing experience
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.980]   of how God breaks in the here and now.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.020]   That our citizenship is in heaven and not here on earth.
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.420]   And so here's Paul and Silas.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.300]   They've just done this.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.660]   They get thrown in jail.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.780]   They're in this jail.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:22.960]   It's an oppressive place,
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.420]   but they're singing their hearts out with worship.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.300]   They're rejoicing Jesus so much that they're in chains,
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.780]   that an earthquake happens, breaks their chains,
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.940]   and they're set free.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.340]   The jailer is so freaked out about it
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.460]   that he runs into the room and says,
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.700]   "Hang on a sec, if you escape,
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.820]   I'm gonna be killed, me and my whole family."
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.940]   They lead the jailer to Jesus.
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.840]   They take him to the river,
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.940]   the same place where they've met Lydia, and baptize him.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.100]   His whole family comes into the church and adds the church,
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.580]   and now they're 34.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:54.220]   This is Paul's work in Philippi.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.420]   It's transformative and miraculous,
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.820]   and it's happening small,
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.580]   but he still writes to this church.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.060]   And he says, "Don't you realize
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.300]   that what you're doing right now
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.540]   is the most audacious, provocative, transformative,
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.340]   powerful, and creative thing you could ever do?"
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.940]   This is the church, and it's alive.
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.260]   So there's persecution happening in this church,
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.340]   deep persecution,
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.220]   because if people believe Jesus in this environment,
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.420]   and they worship Jesus over Caesar,
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.140]   that's gonna bring them into trouble.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.580]   The second thing that's happening is this.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.160]   This is fascinating to me.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.900]   Divisions are happening in the church.
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.620]   Anytime that you find the church
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.340]   under pressure from society around it,
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.740]   you're always gonna find that church
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.740]   become more and more divided.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.180]   Always seems to be the way that disunity grows
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.100]   when there seems to be pressure from without.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.020]   And in Philippi,
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.540]   just a small little church of 30-plus people,
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.100]   division starts to happen.
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:47.940]   And in Philippians,
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.580]   Paul writes to the different leaders
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.060]   of these different factions,
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.620]   and he says to them, "What are you doing?
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.620]   Why are you going like this?
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.700]   You are part of the body of Christ,
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.900]   and you might have different opinions
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.300]   about stuff that's happening in the world around you,
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.220]   but you are united by one spirit,
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.020]   that no matter what differences of opinion you might have,
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.380]   there is the Spirit of God at work in you,
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.860]   and that draws you together."
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.860]   So you've got a church that is suffering
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.940]   under an increasing amount of persecution,
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.660]   and you've got a church, because of that,
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.300]   that is finding itself divided politically.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.540]   I wonder if Philippi reminds you of something.
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.220]   Are you with me?
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.300]   - Yes.
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.500]   - This is why I wanna take seven weeks to say,
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.100]   well, what did Paul say to this group of people?
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.100]   Because perhaps what Paul said to them
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.940]   might have something important to say to us
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.660]   in this hour of Hong Kong that we find ourselves in.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.540]   I think we need to recapture the vision
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.620]   of the provocative, audacious, powerful, transformative,
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.300]   comforting, healing, renewing thing that is the church.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.580]   So here's how Paul does it.
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.940]   Is this interesting, by the way, so far?
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.060]   We got seven weeks of this,
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.540]   so it better be interesting for you,
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.420]   otherwise I'm gonna have to tell
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.020]   more public transport stories to keep you awake.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.660]   But let me break down Philippians.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.540]   The letter was written as one letter by Paul.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.500]   We broke it into four chapters
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.260]   when we put it together for the Bible,
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.380]   but those chapters help the flow of Paul's argument.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.620]   So let me show you what Paul's argument is.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.340]   Chapter one, he basically says this,
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.420]   "The gospel, despite our assumptions and fears,
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.340]   "is unstoppable.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.420]   "It is like a rushing river,
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.820]   "unimpeded by persecution chains or human leaders."
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.140]   Can I have an amen?
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.340]   Here's the second chapter.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.700]   The story of Jesus Christ guides the way
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.820]   to what it means to live a victorious life,
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.300]   a life that we can be empowered to live
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.020]   before a watching world.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.100]   You see, for Paul,
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.860]   the church was never supposed to be a private thing.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.620]   It was always a public thing that shows the world
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.220]   something about Jesus.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.060]   Chapter three, "The gospel demands a complete transformation
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.980]   "towards a crucified life in Jesus.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.500]   "The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.700]   "is our model and path."
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.100]   In other words, if we wanna be a public expression,
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.540]   it can't be of our politics.
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.300]   It can't be of just what we think we believe.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.300]   It can't be of our whatever it might be.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.060]   It has to be the cruciform life in Jesus.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.260]   In other words, it's about Jesus.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.100]   It's about Jesus.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.660]   It's about Jesus.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.300]   And the more that we come to understand
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.060]   the death and resurrection of Jesus,
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.260]   the better we are representatives of his body on earth.
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.540]   And then in chapter four, he says,
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.860]   "The God of the gospel is a God of peace and glory.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.340]   "While we may face many trials,
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.340]   "we live in joy, thanksgiving, and hope."
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.340]   Like if you truly believe that he is the one
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.260]   who brings a gospel that's unstoppable,
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.380]   I mean, if you truly believe
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.020]   that that gospel is centered on Jesus Christ,
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.180]   that we can live in a way before the watching world
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.660]   that says something about Jesus,
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.940]   if we center ourselves in his death and resurrection,
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.380]   then despite what might be happening around us,
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.900]   we can know joy.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.940]   Paul's in prison as he writes to a church
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.060]   that feel like they're in prison.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.140]   And he's saying to them,
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.380]   "Even in your midst of what you're going through right now,
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.540]   "you can know joy."
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.100]   Because joy is not based on circumstance.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.180]   Joy is based on a person, and his name is Jesus.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.620]   So let me show you, as I draw to a close,
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.140]   I'm sure you're happy to hear.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.260]   Let me read to you the central passage of Philippians.
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.540]   It's found in Philippians 1, verses 27 to 29.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.100]   But it's the central thesis that he has for the whole book.
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.460]   Let me read this to us.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.540]   "Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.500]   "worthy of the gospel of Christ.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.540]   "Then, whether I come to see you
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.180]   "or only hear about you in my absence,
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.980]   "I will know that you stand firm in one spirit,
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:46.420]   "contending together for the faith of the gospel,
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.260]   "without being frightened in any way
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.780]   "by those who oppose you.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.500]   "This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed,
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.980]   "but that you will be saved, and that by God.
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.660]   "For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ,
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:06.660]   "not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him."
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.180]   This is Paul in his most gracious and loving,
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.780]   and in his most sobering and challenging.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.220]   I wanna break this down for you real quick.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.140]   Notice how he starts.
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.020]   It's the gospel of Jesus.
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.740]   It's all about Jesus, the good news of his life,
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.100]   death, and resurrection.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.780]   And in the gospel, we can stand firm.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.900]   He wants the church to stand firm.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.180]   He doesn't want the church to wilter under the pressure.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.660]   He doesn't want the church to believe every wind of teaching.
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.860]   It's the gospel, and only the gospel,
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.580]   and we stand rooted on that.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.740]   Jesus would say, "That's like building your house on a rock."
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.660]   Building your house on a rock,
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.620]   not building your house on sand.
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:47.140]   So we as a church are to stand firm together on the gospel.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.020]   He says this, "So you strive together as one."
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.740]   I don't want divisions amongst you,
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.660]   Paul's writing to the church.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.280]   Like if you're divided, you will fall.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.980]   Like you've gotta be united together,
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.500]   and the way you get united together,
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.060]   know that there's one spirit.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.820]   One spirit that you worship,
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.420]   not a bunch of different spirits.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.580]   There's one gospel, one Jesus, one spirit.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.020]   And the oneness of God is the entry place
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.820]   to your oneness together.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.340]   And in your oneness together,
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.820]   you're then able not to be frightened in any way
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.420]   by those who will oppose you.
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.200]   Paul is honest with the church.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.680]   There are going to be people that will oppose you
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.540]   if you stand for Jesus over and above everything else.
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.460]   'Cause it will jar up at some point
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.100]   against the rest of the philosophies
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.220]   and ideas of the world.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.840]   And because of that, that opposition is gonna come,
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.980]   but you don't need to fear the opposition.
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.820]   Why?
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.440]   Because you're not alone, you're together.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.500]   Because you're united with one spirit.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.700]   And with one spirit,
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.820]   you can walk forward with courage in this time.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.260]   He then says this,
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:56.260]   "So that you may have to be prepared to suffer for him."
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:02.140]   This is strong, personal, real.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.900]   Because Paul is in chains writing this
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.880]   to a church that knows what it is to suffer.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.680]   But he says, "You don't do it alone.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.880]   You do it on the gospel.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.240]   You do it united together by one spirit.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.680]   So you don't have to fear whatever happens to you.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.640]   I'm in chains, but I am rejoicing
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.740]   because we're living a life that's worthy of the gospel."
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.880]   And that's what he says right here at the start.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.520]   He uses this word, "Conduct yourself."
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.380]   Very quickly, in the Greek,
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.520]   this word is the word, "Politiomi."
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.040]   "Politiomi" is a Greek word
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.160]   by which we get our common English words,
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.480]   political and politics.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.320]   That also comes from the Latin word of "polis,"
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.880]   which means for the people.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.240]   "Politiomi" is only used by Paul in two occurrences
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.080]   in the whole of the New Testament.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.400]   And both of those occurrences are in the book of Philippians
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.160]   here and in chapter three.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.880]   Essentially, what the word means is this,
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.360]   to be a citizen
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.800]   or to administer the civil affairs of something.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.760]   Now, I wonder why Paul uses a political word
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.440]   about citizenship and puts it into the letter
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.240]   to a church based in Philippi.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.840]   Based on everything that I've said so far,
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.920]   do you understand why he's doing that?
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.400]   'Cause remember what I said right at the start.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.280]   Philippi was a city proud about its citizenship,
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.600]   that it worshiped Caesar Augustus as Lord and Savior,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.960]   and it enjoyed the same citizenship
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.000]   as everything in Italy.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.680]   Paul writes to them and says,
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.160]   "The way you are to live as a church
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.280]   is to politiomi around Jesus Christ,
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.520]   to have Him as the main force of your life
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.160]   so that your citizenship is on behalf of the gospel,
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.280]   not on behalf of some world system.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.960]   Your citizenship is heaven,
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.600]   and it's not something that you would discover
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   or find on earth."
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.640]   He's writing to a bunch of people
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.160]   that are being persecuted,
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.040]   and he's saying to them,
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.840]   "The ultimate place that you find your freedom
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.720]   and your allegiance and your citizenship is not Italy,
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.480]   it's not Rome, it's Jesus."
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.680]   This is dangerous stuff.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.880]   But Paul is doing this,
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.280]   not because he's trying to stir up some rebellion
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.560]   amongst his people.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.280]   It's really important you hear me say this.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.480]   Paul is not trying to stir up anarchy
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.640]   amongst the church in the society.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.280]   He's not trying to get his church to rebel against society.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.000]   What he's doing is saying this,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.120]   "When it ultimately comes down to it, you have a choice.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.000]   Is your allegiance primarily gonna be to Jesus,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.400]   or is it gonna be to Caesar?
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.440]   There will be a time that if you believe
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.640]   in the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.600]   then that gospel will at some point
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.680]   bring you into opposition with the other philosophies
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.200]   and ideologies of your age.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.320]   And when it does, you're likely to suffer for it.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.520]   And in that suffering, you have a choice.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.440]   Will you be a citizen of heaven,
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.280]   or will you be a citizen of earth?"
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.800]   He's saying to them
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:57.120]   that you are to administer your civil affairs today
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.120]   in society as if you were actually already living in heaven.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.360]   That like you're on a bus and someone's manifesting a demon,
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.840]   you cast that demon out.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.560]   Another way of writing Philippians 1:27 would be this.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.360]   Go back one.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.680]   "Whatever happens in life,
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.360]   you are to administer together your civic affairs
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.360]   in a manny worthy of the good news of Jesus."
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.560]   Could you imagine that?
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.120]   That we would administer our civil affairs.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.240]   In other words, the things that we do as a church in public
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:38.080]   in a way that brings honor and glory to the gospel,
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.760]   in a way that enables us as a church
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.280]   to stand strong and stand firm, not in rebellion.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.800]   This is the same Paul that writes to the church in Rome
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.960]   and says that governments are instructed
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.680]   and put there by God's spirit,
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.720]   that we are to give, as Jesus would say,
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.720]   to Caesar what is Caesar.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.760]   This is the same Paul.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.280]   He's not calling for rebellion,
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.440]   but he is calling for an allegiance to Jesus.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.040]   And he is saying that in that allegiance,
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.200]   you have to be prepared that it might bring you up
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.720]   against things that oppose it.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:14.200]   Will we stand firm?
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.600]   I think that's a great challenge for the church in Hong Kong
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.560]   in the years ahead.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.680]   And I think alone, I'm freaking out.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.000]   Together, we stand united.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.920]   We stand with one spirit, an alternative society,
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.800]   the kingdom of God, the ecclesia, the church,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.160]   believing that with the gospel held forth,
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.440]   we could shine like stars in the universe.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.120]   With the gospel held forth,
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.400]   we could see many people come
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.800]   into the saving knowledge of Jesus.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.440]   With the gospel held forth,
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.500]   we could together begin to model something of what it is
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.640]   to see the glory of God on earth.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.480]   Why?
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.400]   So that we get some great holy huddle on a Sunday?
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.680]   No, so that many who are lost
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.000]   would find their Lord and savior.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.440]   Not Caesar, Jesus Christ.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.680]   Can we stand together?
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.680]   I wanna pray for us.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:13.700]   As we pray, I want to read that passage in Philippians,
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.960]   but from the message version,
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.160]   as I think it says something critical for us as we pray.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:25.080]   So stand united, Vine Church, singular in vision,
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.520]   contending for people's trust in the message, the good news,
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.240]   not flinching or dodging in the slightest before opposition.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.800]   For your courage and unity, Vine Church,
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.720]   will show them what they're up against.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.720]   Defeat for them, victory for you, and both because of God.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.320]   For there is far more to this life than trusting in Christ.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.960]   There's also suffering for him.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.740]   And the suffering is as much a gift as the trusting.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.960]   As we lean into that thought over the next seven weeks,
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.580]   can we pray?
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.900]   Father, we stand now together.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:05.080]   We stand, Lord, as a church, like the church in Philippi,
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.800]   broken at times, bruised.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:12.740]   A church where we know in the last couple of years,
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:15.640]   there've been divisions and factions,
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.280]   differences of opinion that have driven wedges
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.280]   between people and relationships,
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.760]   between leaders and congregations
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.320]   and congregations and leaders.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.080]   Father, we know that we're standing in a time
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   and in an hour that much like the church in Philippi,
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.580]   was a challenge to the gospel.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.000]   But Lord, just as we see Paul write
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.780]   to the church in Philippi, that the gospel is unstoppable.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.400]   I pray that as we open up this book
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.400]   over the next seven weeks,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.120]   we as a church would recapture that grand vision,
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.280]   that the church is able to show the world
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.120]   a new and fresh vision for life.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.560]   One where those who are divided
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.680]   can come together in unity again.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:03.060]   One where those that have their own challenges
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.340]   can find in unity with others,
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.680]   the grace to see those challenges overcome.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.160]   A church that is the most audacious,
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.920]   provocative, transformative, powerful,
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.160]   creative thing that there is on earth.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:21.140]   Because together we are the body of Christ.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.840]   Lord, I pray for the body of Christ here at the Vine.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.000]   I pray Lord that this would be a shifting time
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.040]   for us in this season of this particular series.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.460]   I pray that over the next seven weeks,
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.880]   you would install into us a fresh passion
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.680]   for one another again.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.280]   That we would look across the aisles and across the rows
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.440]   and have a desire to be in community with one another.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.680]   That we would do all that we can to contend for the gospel.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.840]   That we would do what we can in this hour of our city
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.080]   to live a life that's worthy of the gospel.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.920]   That we would do so not to be rebellious,
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.560]   we would do so because we are citizens of heaven,
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.840]   given this great gift, this peace and this joy
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.640]   that comes upon us in the lightness of your gospel.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.120]   And that in that we can walk forward
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.360]   with courage and hope.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:15.800]   That even in moments of struggle and strife and suffering,
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.700]   we can sing praises of joy.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.600]   Lord, I pray that your vision for church
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.860]   would come and capture our hearts again.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.360]   And that Lord, you would strengthen us
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.820]   and strengthen your church across this city
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.680]   to bring the gospel more and more
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.820]   to a city that so desperately needs it.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.880]   Lord, would you do that amongst us in these seven weeks,
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.340]   we pray in Jesus' name.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.560]   Everyone says, amen.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.000]   Can we just close in a little bit of worship now together?
