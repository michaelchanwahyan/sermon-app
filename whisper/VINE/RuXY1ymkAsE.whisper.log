[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   A while back, actually it's a long time ago,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.760]   I was in a conflict.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.240]   And it wasn't one of those conflicts where one time something happens,
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.480]   but it was a conflict that just kind of kept meandering along.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.520]   Like, one thing happens, another thing happens,
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.200]   and another thing happens that make you upset.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.360]   And I got to the point where I was just fed up.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.560]   I had it. I had enough.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.800]   So this person was so rude, so inconsiderate,
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.400]   you know, how dare they.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.080]   And I don't know, I can't remember exactly what happened,
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.000]   but I was challenged, either by a friend or through a book
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.160]   or something I was doing, I was challenged
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.520]   to pray a prayer of blessing over this person.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.680]   And I was like, that is the last person
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.080]   that I want to pray a prayer of blessing over.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.320]   I didn't want to do it.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.440]   But eventually I did it anyhow.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.000]   So I prayed for this person, and I was having problems with
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.320]   a blessing over them.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.640]   And I don't remember how many times I prayed this,
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.440]   but at one time, while I was praying,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.280]   the Holy Spirit suddenly highlighted to me
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.880]   and gave me insights into a lot of pain and difficulties
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.880]   that this person had gone through.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.360]   And that really allowed me to have a different level
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.720]   of compassion and care,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.480]   because it provided context for how they were acting towards me.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.720]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.640]   I still believe that as adults, we're responsible for how we act,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.400]   and we need to own our actions and everything.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.160]   But it still was helpful to understand the context,
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.640]   and it gave me a lot of compassion and care.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.000]   And eventually it really changed my outlook on the person.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.520]   I started looking at the person in a different way.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.880]   Now, what had happened?
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.600]   Well, instead of looking at the person through my human wisdom
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.960]   and my human understanding,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   when I prayed, God gave me spiritual sight.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.680]   He let me see this other person through his eyes
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.000]   instead of just seeing them through my eyes.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.120]   And that was so powerful because it allowed me to suddenly
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.240]   be more patient, to show more grace,
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.920]   to be more understanding,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.520]   but then also eventually to be able to forgive
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.240]   and to really just move forward.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.320]   You know, it's amazing, right?
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.080]   When God gives us spiritual sight,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.960]   when he gives us a faith perspective,
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.440]   how we suddenly can navigate,
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.760]   you know, something where we only had one way of looking at it,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.720]   we're suddenly able to navigate it differently,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.200]   and it can make all the difference.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.840]   Now, we all in our lives, in big ways and in small ways,
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.920]   we have situations, circumstances
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.200]   where we're looking right now at them
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.160]   from a human perspective with human wisdom.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.600]   And that's okay because we're human
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.080]   and we should use our human perspective.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.840]   We should use our human wisdom.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.480]   But I really have the sense,
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.720]   as I was writing this sermon series and preparing this for us,
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.480]   that God wants to give us spiritual sight this year,
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.000]   that he wants to give us a deeper faith perspective
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.720]   of what he's doing, of what is going on,
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.400]   so that instead of just seeing the things
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.840]   through our limited lens,
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.000]   that we can have a fuller perspective,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.640]   that we can understand what God is doing,
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.560]   that we can face, if it's a challenge,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.560]   that we can face the challenge with hope,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.680]   with courage, with perspective and trust in him,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.000]   or if it's an opportunity
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.680]   because it can also be positive things, right?
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.480]   That we also know how to walk,
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.560]   how God is leading and what he wants us to do.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.120]   And so I want to explore with you
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.640]   the following question that's this.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.200]   How can I cultivate spiritual sight
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.800]   in approaching and understanding my life?
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.320]   How can I gain a greater faith perspective?
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.600]   How can I more consistently see things
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   through the eyes of faith?
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.040]   And how in the world do you do that?
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.960]   What does that look like?
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   And how might God invite you
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.640]   to have deeper spiritual sight this year?
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.440]   So I'm excited about this.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.080]   We're continuing in our sermon series, Bold in Prayer.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.480]   Last week, we looked at Matthew 9,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.520]   where we talked about that Jesus,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.760]   as he was seeing the crowds and was seeing their needs,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.560]   and they were helpless and they were rest,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.280]   he invited the disciples to pray
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.520]   for the Lord of the harvest to send out,
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.000]   to cast out, to thrust out workers into the harvest field.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.120]   And I really believe that part of that is,
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.720]   part of that thrusting out is that actually
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.040]   God also gives us different spiritual sight
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.720]   so that we start looking at our days,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   at our routines, at the people around us in different ways.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.800]   And we can understand where he's at work
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.040]   and where he's inviting us to partner with him
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.440]   in the work that he is doing.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.400]   So that's what we looked at last week.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.680]   Today, we are in 2 Kings.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.240]   I want to provide a little bit of context for you.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.280]   And I'm going to start by looking at a map
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.360]   that I stole from Pastor Ivan that he used this morning.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.800]   I was like, "Oh, this makes it a lot easier
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.760]   to explain what I want to explain."
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.080]   So let me use the same map.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.040]   So 2 Kings to give a little bit context
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.840]   since we are not consistently right now
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.200]   walking through the book of 2 Kings.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.040]   So first there's a reign of King Solomon
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.160]   and also the demise of that.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.400]   There's a separation of Israel being one nation
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.280]   to being two kingdoms, Judah and Israel.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.520]   So the Southern kingdom, the Northern kingdom.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.720]   We're going to pick things up
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.040]   around the ninth century before Christ,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.040]   where the prophet Elisha, he is in Dothan.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.880]   I want to say Gotham, but it's Dothan.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.720]   You know, Germans have problems with T-H.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.560]   Dothan.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.480]   And we're also going to be looking at Samaria,
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.120]   which was the capital of the Northern kingdom.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.720]   And its King Jehoram is Israel's king.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.120]   He's actually not even mentioned in the passage
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.040]   that we're going to look at by name.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.440]   Let me go to the other side.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.520]   All right.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.000]   And then we're going to look at King from Aram
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.440]   who was raiding, attacking, warring with Israel.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.440]   So this is the broad context.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.880]   There's a lot more going on,
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.160]   but I think that gives you a little bit of an idea
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.520]   of what's going on.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.960]   So let me take you to 2 Kings 6.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.120]   We're starting in verse eight.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.520]   It says this.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.240]   Now the King of Aram was at war with Israel.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.720]   After conferring with his officers, he said,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.320]   "I will set up my camp in such and such a place."
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.280]   I think it's very cool that the Bible uses the word
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.240]   such and such.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.560]   Verse nine.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.800]   The man of God sent word to the King of Israel,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.640]   "Beware of passing that place
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.520]   "because the Arameans are going down there."
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.800]   So the King of Israel checked on the place
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.600]   indicated by the man of God.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.640]   Time and time again, Elisha warned the king
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.520]   so that he was on his guard in such places.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.960]   Now it's enraged the King of Aram.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.440]   He summoned his officers and demanded of them,
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.320]   "Tell me which of us is on the side of the King of Israel."
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.000]   "None of us, my lord," said one of his officers.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.120]   "But Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel,
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.840]   "tells the King of Israel the very words he speak
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.040]   "in your bedroom."
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.000]   "Go find out where he is," the king ordered.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.040]   "So I can send men and capture him."
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.560]   The report came back.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.280]   He is in Dothan.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.280]   Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.200]   and they went by night and surrounded the city.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.160]   So we're told King of Aram, he's picking a fight.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.760]   He's warring against Israel.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.840]   He makes all these amazing plans
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.920]   with his officers in the war room.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   But for whatever reason, his plans are always thwarted.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.480]   The King of Israel is always able to avoid him.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.760]   So they're not able to catch him.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.520]   They're just always able to escape.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:10.000]   And so the king realizes this,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.760]   I mean, this is beyond coincidence.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.760]   One time, okay, two times, okay, three times, okay,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.160]   four times, come on.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.000]   Who's the leak?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.720]   Who's the mole?
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.680]   And so then he's told that it's not any of his officers,
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.520]   but it's a prophet, Elijah,
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.160]   and that he knows the very words
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.480]   that are spoken in the bedroom of the king,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.880]   which is very creepy.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.880]   But what that means is if Elijah, the prophet,
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.280]   knows what is spoken in the bedroom,
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.960]   that means he knows everything.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.880]   He can hear everything.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.120]   He can perceive everything.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.080]   God has given him supernatural sight, supernatural insight
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.560]   into what's going on.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.600]   And so the King of Aram decides we're gonna go after him,
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.280]   but I just wanna highlight a contrast here.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.600]   The King of Aram has no idea where Elijah is,
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.200]   while Elijah knows everything about the King of Aram.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.000]   So he even needs to send out a spy to figure out
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.640]   where he is to send someone there.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.560]   And so then he sends the troops, horses, chariots,
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.800]   that would be the equivalent
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.720]   of the most modern military equipment there is.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.600]   I have no idea what the most modern military equipment is.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.480]   I assume it's like drones and helicopters
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.360]   and things, but they're sending like
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.560]   their special forces there.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.240]   And that's a bit of overkill for catching one person,
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.640]   but the King is so frustrated
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.680]   that he's like fully going for it.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.040]   Let's continue in verse 15.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:39.320]   "And when a servant of the man of God got up
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.840]   "and went out early in the morning,
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.800]   "an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.000]   "Oh no, my Lord, what shall we do?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.160]   "The servant asked, don't be afraid.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.600]   "The prophet answered, those who are with us
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.200]   "are more than those who are with them.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.000]   "And Elisha prayed, open his eyes, Lord,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.840]   "so that he may see.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.280]   "Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes and he looked
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.560]   "and he saw his hills full of horses
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.600]   "and chariots of fire around Elisha.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   "So now instead of seeing things
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.960]   "from the Arameans perspective,
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.800]   "now the narrative shifts and we get to see things
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.320]   "from Elisha and his servant's perspective.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.960]   "We get to see things from their point of view.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.840]   "And so Elisha's servant gets up, he steps outside
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.880]   "and oh my gosh, oh no.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.880]   "That's what he says, oh no.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.520]   "They are surrounded by enemy forces.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.760]   "Like I said, it's the most modern military equipment.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.680]   "So this is intimidating, this is scary.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.960]   "He is freaked out.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   "And so he calls out, oh no, my Lord, what shall we do?
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.400]   "So he calls out to the man of God,
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.360]   "who also of course indirectly represents God, Elisha.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.600]   "Like, oh no, what shall we do?
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   "Now it would be easy to just pass over this really quickly,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.920]   "this oh no moment.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.880]   "But when you and I go through an oh no moment,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.840]   "it doesn't usually just pass quickly.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.080]   "It actually really occupies us,
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.280]   "we're really challenged with this.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.640]   "And so I don't want us just to pass over it quickly.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.400]   "Because the truth is that there is something
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.840]   "that every one of us at one point or another,
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.960]   "we feel surrounded, we feel fenced in.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.240]   "We are overwhelmed by the challenges
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.840]   "that are going on in our lives,
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.520]   "where we also, like the servant Elijah,
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.920]   "have an oh no moment.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.560]   "Where there are things we see
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.680]   "and we do not know the way out.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.440]   "We do not know what to do.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.080]   "We have no answer, we have no way forward.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.200]   "So that is what the servant Elijah is seeing.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.800]   "He's seeing enemy forces on the hills,
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.640]   "they're surrounded and they're about to get them.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.880]   "And so then he calls out to Elijah.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.360]   "And Elisha responds, don't be afraid.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.720]   "Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.320]   "Now I have a question for you.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.920]   "If you're overwhelmed, if you are freaked out
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.800]   "about the challenges in your life
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.160]   "and somebody just tells you, don't be afraid,
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.480]   "how do you feel about that?"
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.920]   Might be annoying, right?
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.120]   Let's be honest.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.440]   And we do that a lot in church, right?
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.800]   We tell each other things are true,
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.920]   but sometimes we just don't wanna hear them.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.880]   "Don't be afraid."
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.440]   He's like, "How can you tell me not to be afraid?
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.800]   "There's like horses and chariots all around us
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.120]   "and we're about to be in enemy's arms
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.680]   "and we're about to be taken captive.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.880]   "Like what in the world are you talking about?
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.600]   "Elisha, are you crazy?
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.640]   "And by the way, what do you mean
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.960]   "that those who are with us
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.200]   "are more than those who are with them?
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.040]   "What do you mean by that?
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:14.880]   "What does it even mean?
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.640]   "Who are you talking about?"
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.680]   That's probably how I would have reacted.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:25.080]   And so what Elijah's servant doesn't know
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.400]   is that Elisha has spiritual sight.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.320]   He's able to see what is going on around him,
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.480]   not just from a human perspective,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.440]   but from a supernatural perspective.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.640]   He understands how God is at work in the moment
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.640]   and that makes all the difference.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.760]   And so he prays for his servant's eyes to be open.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.840]   So in verse 17, it says,
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.320]   "And Elisha prayed, 'Open his eyes, Lord,
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.720]   "so that he may see.'
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.560]   "Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes,
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.920]   "and he looked and he saw the hills full of horses
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.040]   "and chariots of fire all around Elisha."
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:14.920]   So Elisha prayed for spiritual sight for his servant,
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.040]   and God opened his servant's eyes,
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.920]   and he suddenly was able to see the circumstances,
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.840]   the situation that he's in, that he's facing,
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.120]   from a completely different perspective.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.760]   While just a moment ago he's crying, "Oh, no,"
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.200]   and he's overwhelmed and there seems to be no way out,
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.440]   now his eyes are opened and he sees those who are with us
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.400]   are more than those who are with them.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.000]   And he sees the chariots of fire,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.840]   he sees the heavenly hosts, the heavenly army
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.960]   outnumbering the enemy that is there to get him.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   Wow, what a perspective, what a change in perspective.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:10.200]   And you know the words, "Do not be afraid that he spoke,
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.400]   "that at first might seem annoying."
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.720]   Now that his eyes are open,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.600]   ooh, I do not have to be afraid,
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.480]   'cause these words of do not be afraid,
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.280]   they're not just wishful thinking,
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.640]   they're actually based in the reality
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.920]   of who God is and what God is doing.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.400]   Can I get an amen, come on?
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.920]   Amen, yes.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:41.240]   And so, so he does not have to be afraid,
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.760]   and you know this is true for us as Christians,
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:51.160]   because what we see is not everything that is going on,
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.400]   there is a spiritual reality, Psalm 34 verse seven says,
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.280]   you know that the angel of the Lord
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.120]   encamps around those who fear him.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.240]   So if you're walking with God,
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.600]   the angel of the Lord surrounds you and encamps you.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   God is with us, you know, we are not alone, he is for us.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.120]   And that's another thing in a situation,
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.920]   it's not just that he gets to see,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.360]   but it also means that God is with Elisha and his servant,
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.520]   they are not alone, and neither are you and I,
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.280]   we are not alone, God is with us,
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:35.160]   and he is for us, even more than we can imagine or think.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.960]   So God is for you, and he's greater and more powerful
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.360]   than you can think or imagine.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.320]   I mean, I don't know about you,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.600]   when you walk around through your day,
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.440]   if you have in mind who God is constantly
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.960]   in all his fullness and all his glory and all his power
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.720]   and all his majesty and all his love, I don't,
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.360]   I want to, but truth be told, I don't.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.600]   So God is more powerful, more loving, more caring
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.960]   than you and I can imagine,
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.560]   and he is at work in our lives,
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.440]   just as he is at work in the life of Elisha
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.200]   and his servant in this moment.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.520]   But let's continue and see what happens.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.720]   Verse 18, "As the enemy came down toward him,
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.400]   "Elisha prayed to the Lord,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.100]   "strike this army with blindness.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.980]   "So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.120]   "Elisha told him, this is not the road,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.960]   "and this is not the city, follow me,
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.240]   "and I will lead you to the man you are looking for.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.760]   "And he led them to Samaria.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.000]   "So after they entered the city,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.660]   "Elisha said, Lord, open the eyes of these men
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.960]   "so that you can see.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.440]   "And the Lord opened their eyes and they looked,
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.320]   "and they were inside Samaria."
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.800]   Now remember, Samaria was the capital
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.480]   of the northern kingdom.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.600]   They're inside the capital of the enemy.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.360]   And Elisha had led them there.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.960]   So we're told that Elisha prayed a second time,
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.600]   so they do attack.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.560]   So just because we know who God is,
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.440]   that he's powerful and great,
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.040]   doesn't mean that we still go through
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.000]   whatever challenge we're facing,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.520]   but we can walk through it differently
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.760]   because we know the power of God,
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.280]   we know who God is, and so we can face it differently.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.440]   And so as they are coming at him,
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.040]   he prays and God answers his prayer,
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.740]   and he strikes them with blindness.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.180]   Now what's interesting is,
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.060]   and I didn't catch this on multiple readings,
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.620]   only after I read some commentaries and things,
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.100]   is that actually the blindness that is talking about here
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.500]   is not physical blindness.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.340]   You're like, what do you mean not physical blindness?
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:01.340]   Well, the Hebrew word that is used here,
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:08.180]   sanverim, it's a very rare word.
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.140]   It's not the normal word that is used for blindness.
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.500]   It's actually only used three times,
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.800]   twice in this passage, once in Genesis.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:19.900]   And it means blindness, dazzling, and deception.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:26.540]   And so in NIV, it's translated as blindness,
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.180]   but if we look at the context,
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.940]   I think we can see that something else is going on.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.620]   Elisha asks them to follow him,
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.260]   that he's gonna lead them to who they're looking for.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.360]   How can they follow him if they can't see?
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:48.140]   And this is still, I think it's like 11 miles or something,
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.040]   so it's still quite a stretch.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.540]   Secondly, he's telling them,
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.740]   oh, this is not the road and this is not the city.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.380]   They were just looking at the city.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.300]   They were just on the road.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.140]   Just because you're physically blind suddenly
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.460]   doesn't mean that somebody can tell you
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.560]   this is not the road, this is not the city.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:12.460]   So something has changed in the perception.
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.980]   They have distorted perception.
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.680]   God has blinded them from the reality
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.500]   of the situation that they're in.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.980]   And so then Elisha is able to lead them
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.140]   into the city, into Samaria,
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.380]   which is the hub of Israel,
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.220]   into the enemy from the Arameans' perspective,
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.420]   the enemy's territory.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:41.340]   And then he prays for them again and their eyes are open.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.060]   And now they can see where they're at.
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.500]   And that's for them an oh no moment.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:51.140]   So earlier we had the oh no moment for Elijah's servant,
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.260]   now we have the oh no moment for the Aramean soldiers.
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.180]   Let's continue in verse 21, see what happens.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.740]   So when the king of Israel saw them,
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.660]   he asked Elijah, shall we kill them?
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.180]   My father, shall I kill them?
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.700]   He's like very eager.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.100]   Do not kill them, he answered.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.180]   Would you kill those you have captured
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.140]   with your own sword or bow?
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.060]   Set food and water before them
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.180]   so that they may eat and drink,
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:19.100]   then go back to their master.
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.700]   So he prayed a great feast for them,
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.100]   and after they had finished eating and drinking,
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.280]   he sent them away and they returned to their master
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.760]   so the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel's territory.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.000]   I mean I can only imagine what it must have been like
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.960]   as these soldiers, as their eyes are opened
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.480]   and they're like oh my goodness,
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.600]   no we're in enemy territory, we're surrounded.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.440]   And there's a king who's like drooling
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.400]   over the opportunity to kill them.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.920]   But since they were not the king's prisoners,
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   they were Elijah's prisoners,
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.800]   he actually, I believe also through spiritual sight,
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.280]   through what God had revealed to him,
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.360]   he shows them mercy and grace,
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.920]   and that then allows them that this conflict,
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.080]   at least for a while, actually does continue eventually,
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.120]   but for a while this conflict ends between Israel and Aram.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.680]   Now this whole passage is,
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.080]   there's two dynamics that I wanna highlight.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.720]   The first one is that it's all about sight.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.880]   You know Elijah sees and knows the plans
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.320]   and knows what's going on and what they wanna do.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.480]   And the king of Aram, he doesn't know,
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.800]   he doesn't have sight.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   Then the military, they surround Elijah and a servant
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.840]   and the servant doesn't have sight
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.760]   and then God gives him sight and then they take away,
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.200]   so as you see it's all about vision
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.240]   and seeing and not seeing.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.560]   And this brings me to a second point is,
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:00.520]   all of this also shows that God is sovereignly
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.720]   over the situation.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.760]   There are politics going on,
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.160]   there are world powers or regional powers here
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.640]   in this case fighting,
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:13.520]   but God is sovereign in the midst of this conflict
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.560]   and is working out his purposes and what he desires,
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.080]   what he wants comes to pass.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.120]   And there's a third thing I actually wanna highlight to you
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.400]   and that is that is a relationship between Elijah and God
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.200]   because we see Elijah pray three times,
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.880]   open his eyes, blind them, open their eyes.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.800]   And Elijah is walking in this relationship with God
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.440]   and that's why he has spiritual sight
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.520]   about what's going on.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.720]   Now, of course, this leaves us at the point
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.120]   of asking question, what does all of this mean for us?
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.240]   This brings us also back to the earlier question
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.640]   that I asked, how can we cultivate spiritual sight
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.720]   in approaching and understanding our lives?
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:04.320]   How can we start not just looking at our circumstances,
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.040]   our challenges from a human perspective,
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.480]   which we again still should because God has made us
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.600]   and given us that, we should use our human reason
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.920]   and wisdom and all of those things,
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.920]   but how can we also look at things with spiritual sight?
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.360]   With eyes of faith or see things through the eyes of God?
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.160]   Now, how do you do that?
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.200]   Well, there's three things I wanna highlight.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.920]   The first one is this really happens
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.880]   through a relationship with Jesus.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.600]   Now, if you wanna have spiritual sight,
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.480]   if you wanna understand what God is doing,
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.400]   if you wanna see beyond just the physical reality,
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.920]   you need to know Jesus
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.680]   'cause when you become a Christian,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.520]   actually even talks about it,
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.360]   it'd be move from darkness to light
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.840]   or from spiritual blindness to sight,
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.960]   it's part of how the Bible describes even conversion
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   or coming to faith, you gain a different perception,
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.040]   a different perspective of reality
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.400]   because now you can see things through eyes of faith.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.200]   You can see that Jesus really is the Savior,
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.640]   that he is God's son, that he did die, that he did rise,
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.400]   that he is powerful over death, over sin,
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.600]   that he is able to forgive us
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.160]   and you can all see this because you are a Christian.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.960]   But then just because we're a Christian
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.200]   doesn't mean that we always have spiritual sight.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.400]   I mean, earlier I was telling a story of me,
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.400]   I was in this conflict and I was not having spiritual sight.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.720]   I was having just my human perspective of what was going on.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.680]   And so we need to nurture our relationship with God
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.880]   to develop the sight.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.200]   And so as our relationship and intimacy with God grows,
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.640]   so does your spiritual sight grow.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.800]   So if you wanna have spiritual sight,
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.120]   we did invest time in our relationship with God,
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.400]   which we're doing right now through his fasting season.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.280]   Now coming before God with our fasting, with prayer,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.560]   with reading of scripture, with worship
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.080]   or whatever else you're doing.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:26.280]   But then the second thing is that the way we gain more sight
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.760]   is through God's word,
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.920]   'cause God's word is God's revelation to us.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.600]   It's how he has shown us who he is,
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.560]   how powerful, how mighty.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.080]   He has shown us his love.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.640]   He shows us his purposes that he has for us
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.640]   through his word.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.880]   And so if we don't know his word, we have limited sight.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.640]   But as we get to know God's word,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.560]   he wants to give us more of a faith perspective
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.240]   'cause we know God's revelation more
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.520]   and we can see things differently.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.680]   We can see things through a lens of faith.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:06.080]   Now, as I was thinking this through,
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.280]   I was reminded of Psalm 119, 105.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.480]   "Your word is a lamp for my feet and a light on my path."
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.720]   It's like we're walking around in darkness
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.600]   because we're not seeing everything.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.480]   But as we go into God's word
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.440]   and the Holy Spirit illuminates God's word to us,
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.000]   we can start seeing who God is.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.240]   He speaks to us even directly about things that are going on
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.920]   and gives us an understanding.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.200]   And it's like light on a path.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.560]   Like before you're working in darkness,
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.640]   now as you're gaining sight,
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.480]   you're working in darkness,
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.720]   now as you're getting to know God more through his word,
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.920]   it's like your path lights up,
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.800]   you're more clear on where to walk and what to do.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.920]   And so if you wanna grow in sight,
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.680]   you need to spend time in God's word.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.800]   And he wants to light up your path
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.520]   in the way that he has for you,
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.120]   whether it's in challenges, whether it's an opportunity,
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.080]   whether that's with your dreams.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.720]   But he will light up your path
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.200]   and he will show you a way.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.240]   So for some of us here,
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.560]   this might be one thing that God is inviting you this year
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.600]   is to go deeper into his word.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.840]   And when we read God's word,
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.040]   we can ask the Holy Spirit to illuminate it,
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.400]   to help us understand his word,
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.640]   to show us what it means for us.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.440]   And he does that, he loves doing that.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.440]   So that is the second important thing.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.680]   That's one way that we live out that relationship
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.840]   is through his word, as we come to his word
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.480]   and ask God to help us understand and spend time.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.720]   So we gain spiritual sight by getting to know God's word
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.120]   and the Holy Spirit illumining God's word to us.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.960]   And finally, we cultivate spiritual sight
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.720]   and approaching and understanding our life through prayer.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.160]   And that's really what the passage really focuses on.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.600]   Right, it's this praying relationship with Elisha
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.400]   and between Elisha and God.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.560]   And where he's able to see things because he prays.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.160]   Prayer is how God gives us spiritual eyes
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.800]   to see what we otherwise would not see.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.440]   So if we're not praying,
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.520]   there's things you're not going to see.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.600]   God only opens those up when we pray,
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.840]   when we come to him and ask him,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.000]   just like Elijah asked for his servants eyes to be open
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.200]   so that he could perceive that he was not alone
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.000]   in the challenge that he was facing.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.960]   But without prayer and without praying for each other,
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.440]   so I also love that it's Elisha praying for Elisha's servant
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.080]   without praying for each other and without prayer,
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.600]   we're not gonna have spiritual sight.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.400]   We're gonna not be able to see things as clearly
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.840]   as they are.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.080]   We're not gonna be able to perceive all of the reality,
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.120]   all of what God is doing in circumstance.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.120]   But when we pray, God gives us a vision.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.000]   He gives us sight and helps us to see things
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.400]   we're otherwise not seeing.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.240]   And so invited to pray.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.520]   Now, I wanted to share,
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.880]   I already shared earlier the story about praying
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.480]   and God giving me eyes to see this conflict differently
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.120]   and to in the end to be able to resolve it, right?
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.240]   So it was the first thing,
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.480]   but I wanna share something actually
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.720]   that's just church plant.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:26.520]   Now in 2022, that's when we announced in one try
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.040]   and the church that sent us here, the Vine,
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.040]   we announced that we're gonna be planting this church.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.240]   And then we started meeting as a church plant team
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.280]   with like 30 people twice a month.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.440]   And so we're gathering together,
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.360]   but we're in one try,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.800]   but we're talking about planting in New Long.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.560]   How in the heck is that going to work?
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   And so we decide that we're gonna have a one-off barbecue
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:53.760]   and Sunday service at EIS International Preschool,
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.840]   which is close to Fairview Park, I think,
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.400]   I can't remember the exact little town.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.000]   And the day before,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.280]   where we actually were running an alpha at the same school,
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:13.000]   I was praying and while I was praying,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.840]   God gave me this overwhelming sense that the next day,
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.480]   God was gonna give us a foretaste
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.120]   of what this church will be like.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.160]   That he will sort of speaks, pull away the curtain
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.520]   and give us a vision of what the Vine in Long will be like.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.280]   And that he was giving us this vision
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.560]   to encourage the team, the church plant team.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.080]   Now you have to imagine, we're not a church yet.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.440]   We're just preparing ourselves, but nothing has happened yet.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.600]   We're in one try.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.720]   And I really had the sense that we needed encouragement.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.840]   We needed to be able to see.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.040]   And so God gave us through this service,
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.280]   a picture of what this church could be like.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.480]   And then another thing happens.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.720]   We had problems with this venue.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.320]   So even though we were already paying rent for it,
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.520]   we couldn't do anything
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.680]   because we were waiting for some permits.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.000]   And so then suddenly this one off barbecue
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.960]   and this one off service, suddenly we knew a way forward.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.720]   'Cause God gave us a way forward.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.680]   We didn't know how to walk.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.560]   This was not part of our plan.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.000]   But now, because God had spoken,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.680]   because he had given us this picture and this experience,
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.800]   now we knew what to do.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   So in January, 2023, we started meeting every week at EIS
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.720]   in that preschool.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.160]   And guess what?
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.480]   The church started looking like that barbecue
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.040]   when we had that Sunday barbecue.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:48.480]   So it's amazing that when we pray,
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.840]   that God speaks to us, that reveals things to us,
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.840]   that he gives us guidance.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.680]   Now this was not part of our plan.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.960]   I did have a plan on how to plant this church,
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.120]   but you have to have a plan,
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.360]   but you also have to be ready for your plan
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.000]   to completely change.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.360]   And this was not our plan and it changed.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.000]   But through prayer, God gave us vision
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.200]   and he gave us a way forward that we did not have,
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.360]   that I did not have, where I did not know what to do,
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.680]   but God showed us what to do.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.120]   And it's the same way that God wants to work in your
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.200]   and in my life.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.400]   And when we pray, he will give us sight about things
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.440]   that we otherwise will not see.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.560]   So we know how to walk, we know what to do.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.760]   We gain encouragement, we gain perspective.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.720]   And so God wants to meet you when you pray.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.360]   So we pray, so when we pray, God helps us to see things
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.400]   that we otherwise would not see.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.720]   Now I wanna invite the worship team to come up.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.400]   So the prophet, Elisha, he prays over the servant
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.600]   and then that he can see, and then he says,
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.160]   or before he does it, he tells him,
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.320]   "Those who are with us are more than those
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.400]   "who are with them."
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.660]   Elisha's servant, he could not see it.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.000]   And I think there's many of us right now
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   we're in situations where we cannot see what God is doing.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.520]   We cannot see how that God is mighty,
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.560]   that he is powerful, that he is at work.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.960]   We cannot see that God is for us, that he's not against us.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.020]   And so we need to come with prayer
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.480]   'cause we need a word from the Lord.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.580]   We're struggling.
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:44.160]   We're overwhelmed, some of us.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.760]   And God wants to give us a word,
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.620]   he wants to give us a perspective
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:52.680]   so that we can move forward, that we are not hopeless,
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.800]   that we're not living just in anxiousness and anxiety,
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.240]   but that we can have faith that God will move with us,
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.700]   that he will provide with us,
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.500]   that we can have faith that he's with us,
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.140]   that we are not alone,
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:10.420]   that we can have assurance that he loves you.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:15.240]   He loves you, he loves you.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.620]   He has not given up on you, he is not finished with you.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.200]   There is more ahead.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.740]   And he has a power and the ability to provide.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:32.220]   And just like Elisha's servant,
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.600]   as I was preparing his message,
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:42.580]   I really believe that God wants to meet us here right now
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.100]   in our oh no moments.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.660]   (soft music)
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:53.640]   Some of us are surrounded
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:59.400]   by these heavy military forces
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.740]   and we don't know what to do.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.080]   And we've been carrying,
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.800]   some of us have been carrying these oh no moments
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.240]   from our 2024 into our 2025.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.100]   And for some of us, these oh no moments have come in 2025.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.000]   We're like, that's not how we wanted to start this year.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.040]   But I believe that God wants to meet you right now.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.180]   He's inviting us to come to him in prayer and to ask him,
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.960]   Lord, give me sight, give me spiritual sight.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.060]   I'm just, I'm drowning here.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.900]   I need a word from you.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.580]   I need you to meet me.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.020]   I need you to give me faith.
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.460]   I need you to give me a hope.
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.860]   I'm struggling to hold on.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:55.500]   I do not know what to do.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:03.700]   And then as we come to him in prayer,
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:08.520]   he is going to release sight.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.540]   He's going to give us words.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.740]   He's going to give us images.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.540]   He's gonna put people around us.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:21.300]   And he's gonna show us that we are not alone,
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.300]   that he is with us, that we can make it through,
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:28.100]   whatever it is, whatever's going on, that he can lead us.
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.300]   And I also have the sense
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:35.660]   that he really wants us to know his power.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.620]   God's power is greater
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.600]   than the impossible situation you are facing.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:50.180]   He is more mighty, more powerful
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.780]   than whatever it is that you are going through.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.340]   And he has the power and the ability
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.700]   to get you through it, to lead you through it.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:03.260]   But not only is he powerful, he also is loving.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.960]   He loves you, he is for you, he is not against you.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.540]   (gentle music)
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:15.960]   The apostle Paul knew this.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:21.240]   He experienced it himself in his own life.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.320]   He didn't have an easy life if you read the New Testament.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.840]   He went through many hardships, trials,
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.800]   unimaginably difficult things.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.000]   And he encouraged the Roman Christians.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.160]   In chapter eight, he says, "If God is for us,
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.760]   "who can be against us?"
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:46.760]   If God is for you, who can be against you?
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.700]   Come on, people.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:53.560]   So part of seeing with spiritual side
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.160]   is seeing how big God is.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.080]   God is bigger than everything.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.160]   He's bigger than the things that appear.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.680]   It's overwhelming to us right now.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.280]   He's bigger than your worry
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.600]   that you hold and that you carry.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.800]   He is bigger than your success.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.440]   He's bigger than your failure.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:18.120]   He's bigger than the temptation that you are facing.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.560]   God is bigger, he is more powerful.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.580]   And if he is for you, who can be against you?
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:29.960]   So I have a question or questions for us to reflect on.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:36.140]   So what is threatening and surrounding you right now?
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:41.720]   What is your oh no moment that you are carrying with you?
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:48.380]   Where do you need spiritual side right now?
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:04.880]   So church, I wanna encourage you right now.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.460]   If you need spiritual side,
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.880]   actually I wanna invite everyone to stand.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:18.120]   If you need spiritual side,
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.800]   whether it's for an opportunity,
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.300]   whether it's for a challenge,
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.640]   wanna encourage you to stretch out your hands
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.720]   right now before you.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   And I wanna ask the Lord for you and pray over you.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.900]   Let me pray.
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:40.740]   Jesus, I thank you that you are mighty and powerful.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:47.220]   I thank you that you are greater than any of the challenges,
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:51.020]   any of the circumstances that we are facing right now.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.620]   Lord, you see the Austrian hands.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.540]   There is struggle, there is difficulty,
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.580]   there is challenge.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.440]   But Lord, I pray right now by your Holy Spirit,
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.160]   will you come, Holy Spirit come.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.820]   Will you move?
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.420]   Will you provide?
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.500]   Will you raise faith where there hasn't been faith
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.820]   in a long time?
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.000]   Will you pour out your love?
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.020]   Where we feel like you have not loved us,
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.220]   you have forgotten us.
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.140]   Lord, will you make your love known right now?
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.660]   Will you make that a lived reality?
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.060]   Where there's fear, will you speak the words of us?
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.780]   Do not be afraid,
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.280]   because I am with you, you are not alone.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.000]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.740]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.860]   Give us eyes to see.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.700]   Lord, we need you.
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:39.800]   Give us vision.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.060]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.560]   Amen, amen.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.100]   Let's worship church.
