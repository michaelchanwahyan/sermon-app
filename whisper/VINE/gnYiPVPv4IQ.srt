1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
 So last week we had Vision Sunday here at The Vine, so if this is your first Sunday

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,200
 with us or if you weren't able to be with us last week, we know that a lot of people

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,400
 travel and things like that.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,540
 So welcome back.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,440
 We did Vision Sunday last week where we released really to you as a church a sense of what

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,080
 we are kind of feeling that God is saying about us as a church community here in Hong

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,640
 Kong in this time and really a word that we believe is going to sit over us as a church

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,440
 over the rest of this year and probably into the year to come in 2026.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,680
 And it's a word for us as a community together because if this is your home church, you're

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,640
 not here just as yourself.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,440
 You're here a part of a community, but it is also, as I said last week, a word for you

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,680
 individually, for you personally in what is happening in your life.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,960
 And it is this word that we're in uncharted territory, that the Lord is wanting to move

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,880
 us into uncharted waters.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,520
 And I shared a picture last week that I had a few months ago about us as a church community

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,480
 like this, one of those early pioneer ships where they would be in safe harbour, but then

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,600
 they would set out from safe harbour out into the ocean and they would literally be sailing

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,200
 out to where there was no maps.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,440
 And they had this early kind of unreasonable hope that they believed that if they just

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,160
 sailed beyond what they had currently mapped out, that there might be lands beyond what

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,960
 they could realise or what they thought.

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,540
 And this idea of the uncharted is exactly that, that there is no map, there is no ability

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,540
 for us to know what's ahead because we've never been there before.

24
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,320
 And the great encouragement that the Holy Spirit is saying to us as the Bind Church

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,320
 is I desire to take you to a place corporately and individually where you've never been before,

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,760
 where you've never experienced me like that before, where you've never seen my kingdom

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,060
 and my spirit at work like it's going to work ever before.

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,840
 And therefore there is no strategy, there's no current resource, there are no current

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,320
 gifts that are going to be appropriate for what is to come, that this is a completely

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,520
 different time, different season.

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,280
 And what God is saying is are we ready to prepare ourselves for what that is that is

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,960
 to come?

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,680
 And it's interesting because he's pulling us out of our comfort zones.

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,680
 He's put us in a place where we're going to be not with the things that normally would

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,080
 tether us and give us stability, we're going to be a little bit out of what's comfortable

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
 for us.

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,680
 But I want you to know that the greatest moments of growth in your life will always occur with

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,940
 Christ Jesus when you're out of your comfort zone, where you're in a place where you're

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,200
 going to have to rely on him.

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,280
 Last week I shared a few things that I felt would shape this season.

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,460
 It's going to be a season of discovery and adventure focused on the unknown but anticipated.

42
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,020
 This is really important, the unknown but anticipated.

43
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,920
 It's unknown because this is an uncharted season.

44
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,760
 So by its very definition, we don't know what's ahead.

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,280
 But because it's unknown doesn't mean that our posture at this time as a community should

46
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
 be passive.

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,400
 It doesn't mean that, "Oh, okay, we don't know what God's going to do, so we're just

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,680
 going to sit back and kind of just wait for it."

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,160
 In the picture I had last week of that sailing ship that's heading out into the unknown,

50
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,140
 the captain's there at the bow at the front leaning forward with his telescope looking

51
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,140
 for what's to come.

52
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,480
 The intentionality within his spirit to look forward with hope for what is to come.

53
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,180
 So it's unknown, but we need to have a posture of heart, a focus within us of anticipation

54
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,180
 for what's about to come.

55
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,560
 Does that make sense?

56
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,840
 The second thing we shared is that it's going to be a season of wholehearted reliance and

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,220
 trust in Jesus above everything else.

58
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,260
 Because we don't currently have the map and the strategy to hold us where God's taking

59
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,780
 us.

60
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,420
 And we shared last week that it is this purging season.

61
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,180
 That perhaps as a church community and perhaps as you as an individual, there have been some

62
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,260
 things that you've gotten comfortable with to rely on, that you've been trusting and

63
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,020
 putting your hope and your faith and your reliance on that are not Jesus.

64
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,100
 One of the primary reasons why God brings his church into a season of the uncharted

65
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,980
 is to shake off some of the things that we've begun to rely on that are not him.

66
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,180
 And so as we go through this year, we're going to be challenging ourselves, challenging you.

67
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,060
 Have we gone over reliant on something?

68
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,860
 Are we trusting in our own strength?

69
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,660
 Are we trusting in the things that we've trusted in the past?

70
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,940
 And maybe they were great for us in the past, but these are not the things that we should

71
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,940
 be trusting on now.

72
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:40,500
 No, this is a season where Jesus gets the wholehearted reliance and trust in our lives.

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,740
 The third thing we shared is that it's going to be a season where God's people, and this

74
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:51,100
 is really important, a season of intentional readiness where God's people rely and prepare

75
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,580
 not with a plan of action, but a purpose of their hearts.

76
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,100
 In other words, because this is uncharted, we don't have the map or the strategy that

77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,780
 will help us to plan the action steps we need to take in order to benefit from the season.

78
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,740
 No, instead, it's not about an action plan, it's about the posture of my heart.

79
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,260
 It's about what's going on inside of me.

80
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:19,180
 It's about the values that I hold to, because when God acts, I want to be one who responds.

81
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,340
 And so you need to understand that in a season of uncharted, the spotlight that the Holy

82
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,300
 Spirit is shining is on our character over our competencies.

83
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,020
 I'm going to say that again.

84
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,220
 It's shining on our character over our competencies.

85
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,500
 Not that we can't have gifts, not that we can't be good at things, not that God hasn't

86
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,300
 blessed us with things that we're good at, of course, but in this season, the focus becomes

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,780
 more the character than the competencies.

88
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,260
 Because here's the thing, we don't know what competencies we're going to need for the future.

89
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,340
 It's uncharted.

90
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,780
 No one's ever been there before.

91
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,020
 We've not been there before.

92
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
 We've not experienced it.

93
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,820
 We don't know what strategies or ministries or responses we're going to need when God

94
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,820
 acts.

95
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,620
 So it's not about trying to come up with the competencies that are going to hold us

96
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,820
 when God moves.

97
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:09,060
 It's about the character we need today so that when God does move, when the treasure

98
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,560
 is discovered in the field, when we see that pearl of great price, we give everything.

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,100
 We're ready to give it all.

100
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,540
 We're ready to respond straight away.

101
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,980
 It's a little bit like the people that work in the fire service, who are trained to respond

102
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,220
 without fear immediately when the fire takes place.

103
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,580
 Could you imagine a church that was trained to respond without fear when the kingdom of

104
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,420
 God is at work?

105
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,060
 When God begins to do something in our workplace and we don't have the fear of going, "Oh my

106
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,940
 gosh, I'm not going to pray for this person in front of everybody because if I did that,

107
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,140
 I'm going to be judged."

108
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,620
 But instead, we're over our fear and we've got the character that says that when God's

109
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,140
 presence is here, I will respond and here's somebody who desperately needs prayer.

110
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,020
 I'm going to ask them if I can pray for them.

111
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,940
 Or perhaps we're at that family dinner and we're sitting next to the uncle or the aunt

112
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,220
 that's twice removed, who we know is really abrasive against the Christian faith and they're

113
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,900
 beginning to ask us how things are going in our lives and what's happening in their lives.

114
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,580
 And we're thinking, "Well, I better not share anything about church because it's going to

115
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,340
 upset them."

116
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,660
 And we sense that the Holy Spirit is saying, "This might be a moment where you can begin

117
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,060
 to testify about what God's doing in your life and you've been trained and equipped

118
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,540
 to respond to the kingdom without fear."

119
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,020
 Can you imagine a church like that?

120
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,780
 This is not the first time in history that God has called his church to focus on their

121
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,980
 character over their competencies because he's moving them into the uncharted.

122
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,740
 In fact, perhaps the most important moment that this has happened in church history is

123
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,480
 the early church in the first century.

124
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,540
 Those first disciples as they're wrestling with the profundity that Jesus has risen from

125
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
 the dead.

126
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,340
 I mean, imagine the experience they went through believing that Jesus was the Messiah and then

127
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,060
 seeing him killed on a cross and then walking away from that going like, "Well, maybe we

128
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,060
 got that wrong.

129
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,820
 I guess he was just a prophet."

130
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,540
 But then Jesus raised from the dead, shows himself to them and suddenly they realize

131
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,900
 he is the Messiah.

132
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,460
 He is the one that we've been longing for.

133
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,020
 He has come.

134
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,740
 And then Jesus says to them, "Hey, here's the great commission.

135
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,780
 Go into the Greco-Roman empire, sharing the faith of the gospel, teaching people to obey

136
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,380
 my commands and I'll be with you forever.

137
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,380
 And then stay here in Jerusalem and I'm going to send the Holy Spirit to empower you to

138
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,380
 go."

139
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,540
 And then suddenly the disciples are thrust into uncharted territory, uncharted waters.

140
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,380
 They had no idea that Jesus was going to expect them to do what he expects them to do.

141
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,380
 And he doesn't give them a roadmap or a strategy or a plan.

142
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,380
 He sends them out in the power of the Holy Spirit to experience the kingdom, to find

143
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,540
 the treasure, to see the pearls.

144
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,220
 The beautiful thing about the gospel of Acts is that it's this wonderful idea of what happens

145
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,860
 when God shows up when you're least expecting it.

146
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,900
 Throughout the whole book, you have these moments where the writer, Luke, is writing

147
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,540
 these things and he uses this Greek word for suddenly.

148
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,300
 He uses it a lot because he's trying to express the suddenness of God's kingdom.

149
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,940
 He's like, "Suddenly the person is there," and the disciples try to pray for him.

150
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,620
 "Suddenly the chains break off and they're free from prison.

151
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,620
 Suddenly this happens.

152
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,620
 Suddenly that happens."

153
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,100
 And it's amazing because you see time and time again, the disciples just going about

154
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,000
 their normal average day, not expecting anything, and suddenly the kingdom of God appears.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,980
 And here's the question, will the disciples respond when they see a suddenly of God?

156
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,460
 And one of the things that you almost see all the time in the book of Acts is that when

157
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:40,220
 there's a suddenly of God, there's an immediate response from the church.

158
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,820
 There's an immediate respond in faith to what the kingdom and what the spirit is doing in

159
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,820
 that moment.

160
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,780
 And this teaches us something so important about uncharted seasons.

161
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:56,780
 Look, we cannot predict the suddenlies, but we can prepare for the immediatelies.

162
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,060
 Come on church.

163
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,860
 We can't predict the suddenlies.

164
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,980
 This is uncharted season.

165
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,300
 So by its very definition, we can't predict when or how or what God is going to do.

166
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,860
 God's not asking you to predict the suddenlies.

167
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,060
 That's his domain, not yours.

168
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,140
 You can't do that.

169
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,340
 What you can do though is prepare yourself for the immediatelies.

170
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,340
 That when God does show up, when you discover the treasure, when you see the pearl, you

171
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,100
 respond because you put character over competency.

172
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,740
 You put your values over anything else.

173
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,260
 And your value is to say, "God, when you act, I want to be one of the workers in the work

174
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,260
 field.

175
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,500
 I want to be one of the ones that's reaching out with the gospel of hope.

176
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,300
 Lord, would you choose me?

177
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,460
 If you act, I'm going to respond."

178
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,460
 Are you with me?

179
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,180
 So what we're going to do with you over the next six weeks, we're actually going to walk

180
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,300
 through the story of Acts.

181
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,740
 We're not going to look at it as like a book study.

182
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,900
 We're going to pull out actually a study on the character of the disciples, the early

183
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,060
 church.

184
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,020
 And we're going to look at what are some of the key values that they hold in them that

185
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,140
 enables them to be positioned for the immediatelies when God does it suddenly.

186
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,820
 And we're going to teach you six of these things.

187
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,180
 And the reason why we're focusing on this is because these are the things that we feel

188
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,460
 like the Holy Spirit is wanting to teach in us.

189
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,460
 Let me show you what the six values are going to be.

190
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:20,160
 Stepping out, the obedience to respond to the way that the Holy Spirit is, even when

191
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
 it's uncomfortable to do so.

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,100
 The openness to changing our thinking and our traditions when God challenges them.

193
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,620
 The willingness to be persecuted for our faith.

194
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,620
 Come on church.

195
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,340
 Yeah, this is going to be a great series.

196
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,740
 Do come back next week, by the way.

197
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,740
 It's going to be...

198
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,180
 The sacrifice of trusting in Jesus, even when it might cost us dearly.

199
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,940
 The ability to commit to hardship when we know it has redemptive purpose.

200
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,140
 The call to sharing our faith radically, honestly, and hopefully.

201
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:57,780
 My friends, these are the core character values that the early church held inside of them,

202
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,980
 which enabled them to do the things that God wanted to do through them.

203
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,220
 Not that they had a monopoly on what God was going to do, but when God acted, these things

204
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,540
 enabled them out of obedience, out of trust, out of the willingness to be persecuted, out

205
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,300
 of the openness to walking through hard times and hardships.

206
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,900
 They positioned themselves time and time again for the glory of God in the place that he

207
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
 had placed them.

208
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:30,660
 Could you imagine a church in Hong Kong that was willing to be persecuted for its faith?

209
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,100
 Could you imagine a church that's willing to go through hardship knowing it has redemptive

210
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,340
 purpose?

211
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,740
 Could you imagine a church full of courageous and bold people sharing their faith because

212
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,940
 they've been liberated from the fear of man?

213
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,540
 I think this is not just something that God wants the Hong Kong church to hold.

214
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,300
 I think it's something the global church needs at this time.

215
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,900
 We're going to go through this series together step by step, and we're going to bring some

216
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,100
 pretty challenging messages to you over the next six weeks.

217
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:07,340
 My prayer is that God would do something within us, preparing us for the immediate lease of

218
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,340
 his sudden unlease.

219
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,740
 We're going to start today by just looking at the first of these.

220
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,020
 It's really just the first few verses of the book of Acts itself, because in these verses

221
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,300
 you see Jesus do something before any of the sudden unlease occur.

222
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,140
 Jesus prepares his disciples for their next step, for the way in which he can liberate

223
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,780
 them, release some things from them so that they could be best prepared for the sudden

224
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,780
 unlease to come.

225
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,340
 Let me read this to you from Acts chapter one, starting in verse one.

226
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,700
 "In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and teach until

227
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,860
 the day that he was taken up to heaven.

228
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,900
 About giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles that he had chosen.

229
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,420
 After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and women and gave many convincing

230
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,540
 proofs that he was alive.

231
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,100
 He appeared to them over a period of 40 days and spoke about the kingdom of God.

232
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,740
 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command, 'Do not leave

233
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,180
 Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my father promised, which you have heard me speak about.

234
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,660
 For John baptized with water, but in a few days' time you will be baptized with the Holy

235
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,660
 Spirit.'"

236
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,500
 I love what Luke's doing here.

237
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 He's writing this book to his Gentile benefactor, probably a wealthy Gentile called Theophilus

238
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,700
 who was interested in the Christian faith.

239
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,740
 He's writing a story about what happens in the early church to this person.

240
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,500
 He starts by capturing this moment where Jesus is in his resurrection and he's beginning

241
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,140
 to shape and mold the disciples for all that's next.

242
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,860
 I wonder if you've ever put yourself in the shoes of the disciples at the start of the

243
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,220
 book of Acts because here's these disciples and they've just encountered Jesus' death

244
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,220
 and resurrection.

245
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,580
 They've had to wrestle deeply with the reality of that, but now he's risen.

246
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,580
 They've seen him.

247
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:57,260
 He's appeared to them over 600 times, over a lot of times, and he's beginning to teach

248
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,500
 them about the new things.

249
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,980
 There's the great commission and then he says, "Stay in Jerusalem because I'm going to send

250
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,220
 you the spirit, which is going to be the thing that will power you for what's ahead."

251
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,500
 He's speaking about this, but the disciples are now wrestling with the reality that Jesus

252
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,780
 actually is the Messiah.

253
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,980
 I want you to follow this because this is really important for the beginning of Acts.

254
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,060
 The disciples know that now Jesus is absolutely the Messiah.

255
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:28,100
 In their mind, they're thinking that Jesus is going to do some very specific things next

256
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,380
 because they're thinking that they're in a situation where Jesus is now going to act

257
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,940
 how they had always anticipated he was going to act.

258
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,500
 They're posturing themselves for that, but then Jesus says, "Hey, I'm leaving."

259
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,100
 You can imagine the disciples going, "But you've only just come back.

260
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
 You've only just returned.

261
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,300
 What do you mean you're going to leave again?"

262
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,300
 They're thinking, "No, no, no.

263
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
 That can't work.

264
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
 That can't be."

265
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,300
 It's funny, right?

266
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,100
 The disciples have always struggled with the reality of trying to tell Jesus what to do.

267
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,940
 Have you noticed that?

268
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,100
 It's almost like the disciples look at Jesus and go, "God loves you, but we have a plan

269
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,860
 for you."

270
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,540
 Because remember right back before when Jesus was saying, "I'm going to have to die on the

271
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,660
 cross," there's Peter going, "No, no, no, no, no, no.

272
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,660
 That's not part of our plan.

273
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,220
 No, no, you don't need to die.

274
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,220
 It's cool, dude.

275
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,220
 You'll be fine."

276
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,900
 And he's like, "Get behind me, Satan."

277
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,900
 Remember that moment?

278
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,540
 Well, here's another moment like that because Jesus is saying, "Hey, I'm going to go, but

279
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,780
 I need to go because I'm going to send the Holy Spirit to you."

280
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,260
 And they're saying, "We don't want to downgrade Jesus.

281
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,980
 We want you here.

282
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,980
 You've resurrected.

283
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,100
 You're the Messiah.

284
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100
 We want you here.

285
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,420
 And not only do we want you here, but there's still work for you to do, Jesus.

286
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,620
 You've still got some ideas for the things that you should be doing in your resurrection."

287
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,780
 In fact, it actually says here, notice this, follow on in verse six, it says, "So when

288
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,860
 they met together, they actually asked him this, 'Lord, are you at this time going to

289
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,380
 restore the kingdom of Israel?'"

290
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,900
 In other words, the disciples are like, "We have an idea, Lord, of what you're supposed

291
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,540
 to now be doing.

292
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,620
 And we know this because our rabbis have been teaching this in the synagogue and our prophets

293
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,980
 of old, prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah and Amos and Daniel, they've been saying that

294
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,260
 a day will come when the Messiah will be here.

295
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,460
 And it will be like a day of Yahweh.

296
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,700
 The Son of Man will come down and be with us and sin will be eradicated and Israel will

297
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,980
 be restored."

298
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,180
 That's the word they use here.

299
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,340
 Are you going to restore?

300
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,980
 Are you going to bring everything back into the hands of Israel?

301
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,980
 They're expecting Jesus now to do that.

302
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,180
 And this is their idea of what they want Jesus.

303
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,620
 This is like, they're literally coming up to Jesus and going, "Yeah, that's nice about

304
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,500
 the Spirit, but Jesus, you're forgetting something.

305
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,540
 We've got a plan here.

306
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,840
 And we've been talking about this plan for a long time.

307
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,300
 And this plan, I just want you to show, we've actually done a really nice, cute map of this

308
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,300
 plan, Jesus.

309
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,300
 Let me just show you this."

310
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,300
 Right?

311
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,860
 The very first thing you're now going to do is get rid of the Romans.

312
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,220
 Yeah, you know, the nasty Romans.

313
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,380
 You're going to get rid of them.

314
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,020
 After that, you're then supposed to get rid of sin.

315
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,100
 If you want to get rid of sin first before the Romans, that's fine, but we'd rather you

316
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,420
 punish the Romans first.

317
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,660
 So that's why the Romans are there first.

318
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
 Do you see this, Jesus?

319
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,500
 Don't worry, we've summarized it all in a bullet point form here, easy for you to follow.

320
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,100
 Here it is, Jesus.

321
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,420
 Now we laugh, but here's what I want to say to us.

322
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,860
 I think this is the first thing that Jesus wants to release from us as his church.

323
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:21,060
 I think so many of us, myself included, that's really how I am in relationship with Jesus

324
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,060
 in prayer.

325
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,060
 Come on, church.

326
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,740
 Jesus, I love you, but I have a plan for you.

327
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,260
 My plan for you is this, because I have some important things that I'm trying to do in

328
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,140
 life, and I'm trying to achieve some things, and I've got some ideas, Lord.

329
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,180
 In fact, if you have a moment, Jesus, I'd like to just take you into my map and just

330
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,300
 show you a little bit of what I had in plan.

331
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,300
 Right here is when you're supposed to give me my spouse.

332
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:52,740
 You haven't done that one yet, but I'm just highlighting it for you in case you forgot.

333
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
 But that's cool.

334
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,500
 After that, you can see that promotion I've been praying for.

335
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,420
 I know that's coming, right?

336
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
 And I know you want to do that.

337
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
 Are you with me?

338
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,900
 Isn't it interesting that we as Christians, we have this plan, we have this idea, we have

339
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,860
 a map for what we want Jesus to do, and it's like we're in this moment where we want him

340
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,380
 in our prayer lives to basically enact what we're doing.

341
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,540
 Let me just say, not the whole of your plan that you have is bad, but it's your plan.

342
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,540
 It's not his.

343
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,700
 And maybe elements of it he will do, and the elements of it are great, and elements of

344
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,780
 it he might want to respond to, but it's not about you having a plan of what Jesus is going

345
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,940
 to do in your life.

346
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,100
 It's about recognizing you're in an uncharted season, which means the plan has been stripped

347
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:42,620
 from you, which means he's placing you specifically in a moment where all the things that are

348
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,140
 on the list that you're constantly asking him to respond to, again, are not necessarily

349
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,740
 bad things, but he's wanting to shift your thinking and shift your spiritual life away

350
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,740
 from Jesus.

351
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:59,260
 Here's the things I need you now to do for me, to Jesus, what is it that you desire to

352
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,220
 do?

353
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,380
 What is on your heart, not just for me, but for the vine, and for Hong Kong, and for the

354
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,380
 city?

355
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,540
 We're in times where I don't know what's next, so Lord, I'm relying and I'm trusting on you.

356
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,220
 I'm letting go of what I would like, and I'm putting myself in an uncomfortable position

357
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:24,780
 to ask what you would like, and I'm willing to release anything from me that you do not

358
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:32,620
 like, even the plans that I have to prosper you, Jesus.

359
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:38,820
 That scripture, by the way, is I have plans to prosper you, says the Lord, but we Christians

360
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,980
 so often live in our prayer lives as we've got plans to prosper you, Jesus.

361
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,620
 Are you with me?

362
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,460
 We need to purge ourselves from that.

363
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,940
 Notice how Jesus responds, I think this is so beautiful.

364
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,260
 He says in verse seven, he said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or dates

365
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,020
 the Father has set by his own authority."

366
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,300
 He doesn't say it's not going to happen, he just wants to shift them away from something

367
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,540
 that is so critical here.

368
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:12,260
 He's saying, "It is not for you in a season of uncharted to have the answers to the timing

369
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,000
 of everything.

370
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,100
 It's not for you to know the when of God," he's saying.

371
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,300
 In fact, he's basically saying to the disciples, "I want to liberate you.

372
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,380
 I want to free you.

373
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:28,080
 I want to release you from the prison that is created by your desire to know when I'm

374
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,420
 going to do everything."

375
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,740
 It is not for you to have the understanding of the when.

376
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,860
 The when of God is such a thing that we as Christians, I think, so hold onto.

377
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,380
 I know that so much in our prayer life, in our pastoral work, it's like, when is God

378
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,380
 going to come through?

379
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,380
 It's an interesting thing.

380
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,620
 When Christians have an idea of what they think the time frame should be for God and

381
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,420
 God doesn't act in their time frame, they get angry at God.

382
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,900
 I know I've done this many times in my own life.

383
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,980
 You've heard me tell many stories over the years of times where I've put God in a time

384
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,140
 box and God doesn't do it in that time box and I get frustrated and angry at God because

385
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,180
 he hasn't done what I've wanted him to do when I was hoping he could do it.

386
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,820
 The disciples come to him and go, "Is now the time?"

387
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,740
 And Jesus goes, "The first thing I need to do as you move into uncharted territory is

388
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,740
 to release you from the worry of time."

389
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:29,260
 Some of you in this room, you are so tied up in the frustration of the perceived delay

390
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:35,340
 in the delivery of God's activity in your life or the obsession you have for the need

391
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:41,300
 of the foreknowledge of it that you are totally unprepared to react and respond to it when

392
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
 it actually arrives.

393
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:50,180
 Church, man, I need you to read that and pause on that for a second.

394
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:57,660
 Some of us are so wound up by knowing the when, by holding on to the time frame that

395
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:05,100
 we have and the first thing God wants to do is liberate you from the desire that you have

396
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,300
 to know it all.

397
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,500
 This was the desire that Adam and Eve had when they took the fruit in Genesis 3.

398
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,140
 What Satan said to them through the form of the snake was, "If you take this, you will

399
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,260
 be like God.

400
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,260
 You will know it all."

401
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,540
 It's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

402
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,660
 And here's the disciples again saying, "We need to know what it is you're going to do."

403
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:31,140
 And Jesus says, "It's not for you to know the time.

404
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,820
 I want to liberate you from the concerns that you have for time."

405
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,020
 Because here's the thing, the reason why we are so concerned with time is because we want

406
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,200
 to control.

407
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,140
 We want to find some stability, particularly when we're out of our comfort zones.

408
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,540
 We want to find something that we can ridge ourselves into and if we could just know the

409
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,620
 timing that God has for certain things that can happen in our lives, that would, we think,

410
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,260
 free us to relax.

411
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,380
 And what God is saying is that your obsession with time, when that is not in your hands

412
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,980
 and not something you can control, that's you trying to be God.

413
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,460
 You're not God, you're human.

414
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,860
 I'm going to release your desire for the knowledge of the time of everything and you will find

415
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:17,380
 yourself at greater peace.

416
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,060
 See the path for peace in times that are uncharted is not the knowledge of the timing of everything

417
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:31,140
 but the release of the need for control and certainty in all that's going to happen.

418
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,020
 And we cannot start this time.

419
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,420
 We cannot start as a church in this season of uncharted until we've recognized that we

420
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,220
 need to release control.

421
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:48,380
 Release the control and the certainty that God is going to act and respond and instead

422
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:55,660
 posture our hearts in the place of character and values to be able to respond when he acts.

423
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,820
 Are you with me?

424
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,200
 Some of you here, this is a really, I'm going to pause on this one more time.

425
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,220
 Some of you here, this is a really significantly fundamental thing that you need to release

426
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,500
 today.

427
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,180
 And it's scary.

428
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,860
 It'll put you in your, out of your comfort zone.

429
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,180
 It'll put you in a place where you'll feel like you're losing control.

430
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,980
 But sometimes the need for us to feel like we're losing control or that we're out of

431
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,060
 that place of comfort is the starting point of everything that Jesus now wants to do in

432
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,700
 us.

433
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,180
 Notice how this is actually here in the scripture.

434
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,020
 Is this helping some people?

435
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,460
 It says here in verse 7, "It is not for you to know the times and the dates that the Father

436
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,580
 has set," verse 8, "but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you

437
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,660
 will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth."

438
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
 I love this.

439
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,780
 He doesn't say, "Hey, I'm going to give you the answers."

440
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,820
 He doesn't say, "I'm going to sort out all your problems."

441
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,020
 He doesn't say, "I'm going to answer your timeframe, how you have it."

442
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,820
 We've come to him with our maps.

443
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,020
 He's gently rolled them back up again.

444
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,020
 But here's what he's saying.

445
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
 "I'm not leaving you alone."

446
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:14,460
 He said, "You're going to receive power when my Holy Spirit comes upon you.

447
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,460
 So I'm not leaving you to just be here on your own.

448
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,860
 Equally, I'm not giving you a detailed map that's going to give you all the answers straight

449
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,860
 away.

450
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,060
 What I'm going to do, though, is put my power inside of you.

451
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:29,460
 I will pour out my Holy Spirit on you and that power will be what will mark you, will

452
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,860
 be what defines you.

453
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,380
 You're not getting answers.

454
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,580
 You're going to get my power.

455
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,900
 You're not going to get the timing of everything.

456
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,420
 You're going to get my Spirit in your life.

457
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,140
 And when you have my power, then you can become."

458
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,940
 This is so important.

459
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,980
 So often, I think as a church, when we think about the power of the Holy Spirit, we think

460
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,020
 it's for us.

461
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,660
 We think it's for what happens here on a Sunday.

462
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,380
 We come in here longing for the worship and longing for the movement of the Holy Spirit

463
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
 amongst us.

464
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,380
 And we love that.

465
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,380
 And of course, we should.

466
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,380
 It's something to be celebrated.

467
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,180
 It is something to be expected and looked for.

468
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:08,820
 But the power that Jesus is talking here about is not a feeling in a worship service.

469
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,260
 What he's talking about here to the disciples is you're going to receive power.

470
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,580
 And then notice what he says.

471
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,700
 He specifically says, "And then you will become."

472
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,900
 In the Greek, it says, "You will become."

473
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,860
 In our translation, it says, "You will be."

474
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,060
 It's future tense.

475
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,940
 What he's saying is, notice the journey, what Jesus is doing.

476
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,780
 He's saying, "Your plan, not going to work.

477
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,060
 Your obsession with timing is only going to cause you stress.

478
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,700
 I need you to release all of that so that you're a vessel ready to receive the power

479
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,700
 of my Spirit."

480
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,420
 But that power of the Spirit is not just there to make you feel good or to give you some

481
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,220
 gifts or to give you some fruit.

482
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,220
 As much as that is good.

483
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,260
 Here's what the power of that Spirit will do.

484
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,260
 It will make you to become.

485
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,140
 It will transform you.

486
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:57,140
 It will form you, shape you into the person that I need you to be in the time of Uncharted.

487
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,580
 The reason why the Holy Spirit is poured out in seasons of Uncharted is because the Spirit

488
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,180
 longs to change us.

489
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,380
 Longs to transform us and renew us.

490
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,580
 The focus is on character over competency.

491
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,320
 So the Spirit comes to reform and to change.

492
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,820
 And so a season of Uncharted is a spiritual formation season.

493
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,580
 By its very nature, times of Uncharted are Spirit empowered.

494
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,660
 And because they're Spirit empowered, they're designed to change something within us.

495
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,340
 To release sin from us.

496
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,740
 To strengthen us.

497
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,460
 To give us the character and the values that we will need so we can respond immediately

498
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,500
 to the sudden needs that are around us.

499
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,520
 And our vision here at the Vine is growing big people.

500
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,460
 It's a maturity vision.

501
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,660
 It's a spiritual formation vision.

502
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,020
 And this is why God's bringing us into the Uncharted.

503
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,740
 It's not to freak you out.

504
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,660
 It's not to make you feel uncomfortable.

505
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,780
 It's actually to change you.

506
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,340
 You got to understand that the greatest times of spiritual growth and change will happen

507
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,540
 in your life when you have to rely 100% on Jesus and nothing else.

508
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,620
 The greatest times of spiritual growth and change in your life will happen when you let

509
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,100
 go of your need to know everything.

510
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:23,180
 The greatest spiritual change that will happen is when you actually say, "I am open to whatever

511
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,620
 is your heart, your agenda, your plans, your strategy, whatever it is that you want to

512
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,620
 do.

513
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,620
 I have no idea.

514
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,380
 But whatever it is that you want to do, I want to receive it in the name of Jesus.

515
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,540
 Make me into one."

516
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,900
 Oh, let me preach on this real quick.

517
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
 This is not my notes.

518
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,420
 Let me preach on this real quick.

519
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,060
 The prodigal son is one of my favorite stories.

520
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,340
 And it's because the prodigal son goes in this journey.

521
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:51,340
 At the start, he goes to his father and he says, "Give me my inheritance."

522
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,700
 And then he goes and he squanders it and he's in a place of incredible uncomfort because

523
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,260
 of his sin and his brokenness.

524
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,360
 And he decides in that place that it's better to be a servant in his father's household

525
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,660
 than to be in the muck and the mire that he found himself in.

526
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,020
 And as he goes to his father, his father runs towards him.

527
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:12,500
 And the first words out of the mouth of the prodigal son is this, "Lord, make me.

528
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,420
 Make me like one of your servants."

529
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,980
 There's something that happens in the life of the prodigal where he goes from, "God,

530
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,060
 give me," to, "God, make me."

531
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,500
 And that's the journey of the uncharted.

532
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,660
 That's the spiritual formation journey that we're in right now.

533
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,660
 And I want to encourage you, challenge you to be open to whatever the Holy Spirit wants

534
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,660
 to do.

535
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,060
 Because there is a make me that I need.

536
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,900
 And I'm sure there is for you too.

537
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,780
 What is it that he is making us into?

538
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:45,660
 He then says this, "That you would become my witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judea and

539
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,580
 Samaria and to the ends of the earth."

540
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,980
 He says, "You will become my witnesses."

541
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
 Notice this.

542
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,140
 The word witness there in the Greek is the word martyris, which is where we get martyrdom

543
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,140
 from.

544
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,180
 It's the idea of living such a way that people can see.

545
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:05,420
 It was actually a legal term and it was literally designed in the legal concepts of those days

546
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,780
 to be somebody can prove the verification of facts by how they've experienced and lived

547
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,780
 their lives.

548
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:18,180
 A witness is someone who demonstrates and declares what it is that has happened for

549
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,180
 them.

550
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:24,140
 So this emphasis of demonstrating and declaring, not just saying, but living.

551
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,060
 Remember a few weeks ago, we spoke about the idea of a new song that is on our mouths so

552
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,460
 that we can live it out so people can see it.

553
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,100
 That's a witness.

554
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:38,620
 So when Jesus says, "My spirit is going to fall on you and empower you to become a witness,"

555
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,440
 what he's saying is, "This is all about you in public space.

556
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,900
 This is all about me doing something in you so that you would be something of me out there."

557
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,740
 He doesn't come to the church, to the disciples at the beginning of their formation of the

558
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,060
 church and say, "I'm going to pour out my spirit of power upon you so that you would

559
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,340
 be my privately blessed individuals."

560
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,860
 Come on, church.

561
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,500
 He doesn't say, "So that you will be my privately blessed individuals and you'll have a great

562
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,580
 time for 90 minutes on a Sunday.

563
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,580
 Woo-hoo!"

564
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,540
 He says, "No, I'm pouring out my spirit on you because I'm moving you into uncharted

565
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,540
 seasons.

566
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,540
 Take away your strategy.

567
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,540
 Take away your obsession about the timing of everything.

568
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,180
 Receive my power because I want to shape and form in you something so much that you would

569
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:30,780
 then be a public testimony, a public witness to my power, my spirit, my life in the world.

570
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,700
 You're going to be a witness," he says, "in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the ends of

571
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,700
 the world.

572
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:42,260
 It's going to be about what I do within you so that the church would be public, not private,

573
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,460
 huddled together as much as we love doing this, but we do this on behalf of everything

574
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,780
 that's going to happen in your week ahead.

575
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,860
 This is uncharted, that we would be so filled with the spirit, that we're so changed within

576
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,260
 us that we become the living witnesses of God in the world."

577
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,420
 This is why the first value that Jesus is instilling into the disciples right at the

578
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:12,140
 start is this obedience to the work of the spirit, even if that means it's going to be

579
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,900
 uncomfortable for you.

580
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,860
 Are you going to be obedient to what the spirit is doing, even though that might put

581
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,900
 you in some challenging situations?

582
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,380
 Maybe that will put you in a place where it's uncomfortable, but are you willing to live

583
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,700
 your life so much that you would become a witness of him, one who demonstrates and declares

584
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,380
 to the glory of God in the world around him?

585
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,300
 And this, my friends, becomes all of the book of Acts from this point.

586
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,020
 This is why all of this is so important and why Jesus is teaching this right at the start

587
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,760
 into his church because he's shaking off some of the dust that was going to settle on them.

588
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,260
 He's preparing them for what's ahead.

589
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,740
 And in the future, in the weeks ahead, and we're going to see this in the series a lot,

590
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:56,620
 his people become responders, witnesses to the power and the glory of God simply because

591
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,460
 they said they were open.

592
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,340
 In fact, let me show you one example of this very quickly here this morning as we draw

593
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
 to a close.

594
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
 I love this example.

595
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,420
 This is found in Acts chapter 8.

596
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,420
 Follow this.

597
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:13,060
 "Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Philip, one of the disciples, 'Go south to

598
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,220
 the road, the desert road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.'

599
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,020
 So he started out."

600
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,220
 Notice this.

601
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,900
 Philip had no idea what God was going to do that day.

602
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,380
 He didn't go, "Okay, God, thank you for speaking to me this morning in my quiet time.

603
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,380
 I really appreciate that.

604
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,260
 Great to have your voice in my life.

605
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
 You want me to go down a road.

606
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,540
 First of all, I need to know exactly how to walk down that road.

607
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,500
 It would be really good if you could tell me what's ahead down that road.

608
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,020
 I'd like to get prepared for all of that."

609
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,100
 This would be like God saying to me one morning, "Andrew, I want you to walk down one chai

610
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,620
 road.

611
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,860
 I want you to walk from the Causeway Bay end towards central, and I just want you to walk."

612
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,060
 And me going, "I'm going to walk."

613
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,540
 And you guys going, "What is Andrew doing?"

614
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,460
 Philip just has no idea.

615
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,420
 But notice, he's obedient to the Holy Spirit, even though it might be uncomfortable, even

616
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,140
 though he doesn't have all the answers, even though he doesn't know how things are going

617
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,260
 to work out, but he's willing to go.

618
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,620
 Notice what happens next.

619
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:13,100
 "So then he stepped out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official

620
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,220
 in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians.

621
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,860
 This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, and on his way home was sitting in his chariot

622
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,700
 reading the book of the Isaiah, the prophet.

623
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,220
 The Spirit told Philip, 'Go to that chariot and stay near it.'"

624
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,580
 Isn't this great?

625
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,480
 So here's Philip, no idea what's about to happen.

626
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,860
 No idea, but he's being faithful to what the Spirit's told him to do.

627
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,340
 He's walking randomly down this road, but in the side, the story is God is brewing up

628
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,540
 something that only God can brew up.

629
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:49,420
 And here's this Ethiopian eunuch, this man of standing in the upper Nile region of Africa,

630
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,820
 one that God has been working on his heart already, one who's actually gone to Jerusalem

631
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,260
 to learn what it might be to worship this Yahweh, to worship this God, and to wonder

632
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,080
 what the Messiah might be all about.

633
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,660
 So God's at work with the Ethiopian, and he's at work with Philip, who's willing to live

634
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
 in a certain way.

635
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,060
 And it's almost like God is bringing these two things together, and you can see God's

636
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,380
 excitement as they come closer and closer together.

637
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,600
 You following this?

638
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
 So here's Philip.

639
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
 Now notice this.

640
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,940
 Then the Holy Spirit says, "Go and stand alongside of that chariot."

641
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,220
 Now the chariot was walking at the time, so he's having to run alongside this chariot.

642
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,980
 I mean, he's looking like an idiot at this moment.

643
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,780
 But he's willing to be uncomfortable in obedience to the Holy Spirit.

644
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,500
 He's running alongside the chariot.

645
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,840
 He has no idea why he's running alongside the chariot.

646
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,960
 But as he's running alongside of it, he hears the person inside reading from the scroll,

647
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,480
 the book of Isaiah.

648
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,280
 Now here's the fascinating thing.

649
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,560
 At this point, notice what happens, because what we think is going to happen doesn't.

650
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,640
 It says here, "Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading from Isaiah the

651
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
 prophet.

652
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,360
 'Do you understand what you are reading?'

653
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
 Philip asked.

654
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
 'How can I?' he said.

655
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,880
 'Unless someone explains it to me.'

656
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,680
 So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him."

657
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,760
 I love this moment because the Holy Spirit has said, "Go down this road."

658
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
 He had gone.

659
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,520
 The Holy Spirit said, "Go alongside this chariot."

660
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,040
 He had gone alongside this chariot.

661
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,000
 Now the Holy Spirit said, "Talk to the guy."

662
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,240
 No, the Holy Spirit didn't say that.

663
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,000
 The Holy Spirit led him to the very place where then Philip, because he's got a character

664
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,640
 over competency, because he knows he's uncharted waters, because the Holy Spirit has been forming

665
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,040
 and shaping him when he gets alongside the chariot.

666
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,240
 The Holy Spirit doesn't have to tell him to begin to witness to the gospel.

667
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,240
 No, he hears someone reading Isaiah and his immediate response, the immediacy to God suddenly

668
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,200
 is to say, "Do you understand what you're reading?

669
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,800
 Because if not, I'd love to explain it to you."

670
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,600
 And the Ethiopian's like, "Dude, come on up.

671
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
 Sit with me."

672
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,680
 And they sit together and he shares the gospel with him.

673
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,560
 The Ethiopian believes the gospel, repents of his sin, gets baptized, and for all we

674
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,520
 know, he's the very first African convert to Christianity.

675
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,960
 And then he's going to return back to Africa and a whole continent gets evangelized because

676
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,440
 of this one moment, because Philip was obedient to the Spirit, was looking for the Spirit,

677
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,600
 walked with the Spirit, but then was willing to respond with an immediate lead to God suddenly.

678
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,480
 Are you with me?

679
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,520
 A whole nation comes to faith through somebody with that kind of faith.

680
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,600
 Let me close with a story.

681
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:26,000
 Last week, I shared the story about my mobile phone dying on me in the Camino and I shared

682
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
 about how bad that was, but I actually only shared half the story with you.

683
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,400
 Let me now share the other half of the story as we close.

684
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,920
 My phone had completely died, broken, gone, and four days into it being busted, I was

685
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,920
 getting more and more frustrated.

686
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,560
 Frustrated I couldn't speak to my wife and daughter, frustrated I couldn't navigate well

687
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,000
 every day, frustrated I had to rely on everybody else.

688
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,480
 But my frustrations that day were even more because I'd realized the night before, borrowing

689
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,400
 somebody else's mobile phone, that the next mobile phone store was in a city seven days

690
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,160
 walk away.

691
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,560
 And so I realized that not only am I facing these first four days, but I'm going to have

692
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,640
 another seven days before I can actually get a phone up and running and be able to touch

693
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,400
 base with the people I needed to touch base with.

694
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,200
 So I was feeling this huge amount of frustration.

695
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,280
 I was walking really angry at God.

696
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,840
 Anyone been angry at God here?

697
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,480
 Just your pastor.

698
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,440
 So I'm walking angry at God and I'd just gone through a village.

699
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,920
 I'd had a rest stop at this village.

700
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,520
 I'd filled up my water and everything and I was good to go.

701
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,560
 And so I came to this another village and I was expecting to walk through this village,

702
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,760
 which happened a lot on the Camino, because I'd just stopped so I didn't need to stop.

703
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,200
 So I was going to walk through this village.

704
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,840
 And as I'm walking through the village, out of this cafe, this lady goes, "Andrew, come

705
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,640
 and sit with me."

706
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,880
 That's how her voice exactly sounded, by the way, just exactly like that.

707
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,760
 Anyway, it was this lady, Jane, that I'd met a couple of nights before.

708
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,840
 Didn't know super well at that time, met her a couple of nights before, but she wanted

709
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
 me to go sit with her.

710
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,920
 And the last thing I wanted to do was to stop and sit with her because I'd just stopped

711
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,040
 in the previous village.

712
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,720
 And in the Camino, there's this unwritten code that if you wave and smile and keep walking,

713
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,160
 then that just means you want to keep going.

714
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,480
 And it's not seen as rude.

715
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,720
 So I'm prepared to just wave at her.

716
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,120
 And I feel like the Holy Spirit speaks to me.

717
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,360
 And the Holy Spirit speaks really strongly and says, "You need to go sit with her."

718
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,280
 And I'm like, "Okay."

719
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,560
 So rather than walk on, I turn around and I sit down with Jane at this cafe.

720
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,400
 And she asked me this question as soon as I sit down.

721
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
 It's a really interesting question.

722
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,360
 She said, "If you could change anything about the Camino, what would you change?"

723
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,840
 And I said, "Well, right now, I would like to get in a bus, go seven days down the road

724
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,520
 on this bus, get to this place and buy a mobile phone."

725
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,280
 And I told her about my story about the mobile phone.

726
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,200
 As I'm talking to her, she's listening to me very gently.

727
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,160
 She gets her backpack out and she opens up her backpack and she fishes inside the backpack

728
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,620
 and she pulls out a mobile phone.

729
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,680
 And she says, "Andrew, a couple of months ago when I was preparing for the Camino, I

730
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,240
 felt God tell me to bring a spare mobile phone with me."

731
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,440
 And she said, "I pushed back on it because it's carrying extra weight in the bag and

732
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,960
 you know that nobody wants to carry any extra weight.

733
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,200
 But I've been carrying this spare mobile phone for two weeks in the Camino for no reason

734
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,240
 why I was carrying it.

735
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,440
 Now you've just shared your story with me."

736
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,100
 She goes, "I think God wants me to give you this phone."

737
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,960
 And I said, "You are right.

738
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,840
 He does want you to."

739
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
 Faithful woman.

740
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
 Faithful woman.

741
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
 Thank you.

742
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,800
 So, as I'm taking this phone from her, this other pilgrim walks in.

743
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
 He's a German.

744
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,800
 He's like, "Hello."

745
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
 I don't know how to do Germans.

746
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
 I'm not going to do a German accent.

747
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,440
 But he says, "Can I join you at your table?"

748
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
 And we're like, "Yeah, sure."

749
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,280
 He's a young German guy and he comes and sits down and he's like, "What are you doing?"

750
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,040
 You know, like he sees us like handing phones back and forth.

751
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,120
 It's the worst German accent ever.

752
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:40,040
 But he sees us like handing phones back and forth and I say, "Oh, well, you know."

753
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,400
 And I share the story about everything that happened and his eyes lit up and he goes,

754
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
 "Oh, back in Germany."

755
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,400
 He's like, "Back in Germany, I work in a mobile phone store.

756
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,720
 And every day, all day long, I take people's old phones and I get them up and working on

757
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,720
 a new phone.

758
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,480
 If you give me your phone and if you take the SIM card out of your old phone, I will

759
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,440
 get your phone working in 15 minutes.

760
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,440
 And 15 minutes later, I suddenly have a brand spanking new mobile phone.

761
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
 Isn't that awesome?"

762
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,440
 So, here they are.

763
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,440
 Let me show you a photo of them.

764
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
 There they are.

765
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:12,240
 Now, I will admit to you.

766
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,320
 I will admit to you that Philip's story is way better than mine because Philip evangelized

767
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,520
 a whole nation and I just got a mobile phone.

768
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,200
 But maybe it demonstrates that God works in this way in big and small ways and that we

769
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,560
 never know what it is that God is going to do but he is orchestrating it all.

770
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:36,960
 And in times of unchartedness, we can't predict the suddenlies but we can be prepared to react

771
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,960
 with the immediatelies.

772
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,480
 And the way we do that is we have to let go of those plans and strategies of what we want

773
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,000
 or think Jesus should do for us.

774
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,800
 We have to strip ourselves of the when of God and we have to place ourselves open to

775
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:56,680
 receive the power of the Spirit that changes us within us and prepares us that when the

776
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:02,440
 Holy Spirit says, "Go," we go.

777
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,440
 Let me pray for us.

778
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,440
 Let's pray.

779
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,960
 Father, I thank you for each person here in this room.

780
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,800
 I thank you for what it is that you're doing in their hearts and in their lives.

781
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,440
 And I thank you that you have moved them into a season that is uncharted.

782
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,680
 And Lord, we have no idea what it is that you're about to do.

783
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,960
 Lord, on that day I had no idea I was going to get a new phone.

784
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,120
 And Lord, the people in this room have no idea what tomorrow is going to hold in the

785
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,160
 adventure and the excitement of an uncharted season.

786
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,640
 But Lord, I want to pray that we can prepare ourselves for the immediatelies.

787
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:45,520
 And I want to pray for each person here in this moment that you would strip away, that

788
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:52,380
 you would release, Lord, the things that we are relying on that are not of you.

789
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,800
 Whether that's our own plans, whether that's our desire for the timing and the when of

790
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,880
 God, whether that's the frustrations because it feels like you're not answering us on the

791
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,960
 ways and the time where you thought.

792
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,260
 Lord, I believe you want to strip from people in this room right now just an over-reliance

793
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,640
 on the things that are only going to create more frustration in the season ahead.

794
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,240
 And instead, you want to pour out the power of your Holy Spirit.

795
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,440
 So Lord, I want to pray for each person here as they release what it is that you're calling

796
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,700
 them to release here this morning, that they would be filled with the power of God.

797
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,460
 With the power of God so that they could become your witnesses.

798
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:41,120
 That they would become public manifestations of the mercy and the grace and the love of

799
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,000
 Jesus.

800
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,960
 That they would be like Philip, able to react and respond as the Holy Spirit leads without

801
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,400
 fear.

802
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,000
 So Lord, we come against fear.

803
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,480
 We come against the things that hold us rooted to the known.

804
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,820
 We come against the things that would want to root us to where things are comfortable

805
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,820
 for us.

806
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:09,860
 And Lord, we pray that you would fill us with such power that we wouldn't just see the dramatic

807
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,320
 things that we would see in these 90 minutes on a Sunday together as great as they are.

808
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,960
 But it would be the fuel that would drive us outwards to the people of this city that

809
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,960
 you love so much.

810
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:27,440
 There are so many Ethiopian eunuchs just outside the doors of this community.

811
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,180
 Lord, I pray that you would send your church.

812
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,120
 I pray you would send us, Lord.

813
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:39,080
 And that over this sermon series, we would get the values inside of us, the character

814
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:46,640
 over competency that we will need for the incredible, amazing things you are about to

815
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,640
 do.

816
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,200
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

817
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,920
 Everyone says, "Hey, would you stand with me?

818
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,760
 I know we've gone a bit late today, but I want to just finish our time with some time

819
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,040
 in worship as we just allow the Spirit to move.

820
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,720
 So let's take some time to do that now."
