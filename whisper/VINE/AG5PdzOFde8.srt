1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Thank you, worship team.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Thank you, everyone.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,860
 Say hello to somebody as you sit down.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,160
 Well, we are really excited that we continue to be

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,800
 in our Exodus series, which has been just such an amazing

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,160
 journey for us as a church.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,920
 And today we get the privilege of having

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,760
 our two founding pastors share our message today.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,480
 So would you give a very warm welcome

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,880
 as I introduce firstly, John Snellgrove, Pastor John.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,560
 It's so good to have you here.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,400
 It's so good.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,520
 And Sandra was here earlier as well.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,080
 It's such a great honor to have you stand

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,000
 and share a message.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,120
 And I know that there's a new season going for you

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,200
 and Sandra as well, Priscilla and Aquila,

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,240
 I believe it's called.

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,040
 And this really is an opportunity for John and Sandra

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,840
 to empower the global church, encourage the global church

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,320
 in their continuous faith journey

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,020
 and to really equip the younger generation,

24
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,120
 which is really exciting.

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,240
 And if you wanna find out more,

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,320
 then the details are showing up on the screen.

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,480
 Do contact John and Sandra.

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,120
 I'm sure that they would love to tell you more about it.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,600
 So let us pray for John and Tony.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,880
 Father, we thank you.

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,720
 We thank you for the opportunity we have to listen

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,840
 and hear the wisdom from John and Tony.

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,320
 And I pray that you would bless John as he shares right now

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,680
 and that our hearts would really receive what it is

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,480
 that you have for us in Jesus name, amen.

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,760
 - Amen, thank you, Carla.

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,480
 And good morning, church.

38
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,920
 - Good morning.

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,360
 - Good.

40
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,360
 You are not able to go it alone.

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,560
 Can you turn to the person next to you and tell them also,

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,440
 you are not able to go it alone.

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,040
 I noticed something here in Hong Kong.

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,880
 When you ask someone the question, how are you?

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,680
 I invariably get the answer.

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,580
 You know what I'm gonna say, don't you?

47
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,800
 I'm busy.

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,120
 Busyness in a city of business is seen like a badge of merit.

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,940
 I'm busy because I'm important.

50
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:40,400
 And yet Moses was in many ways like that.

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,600
 Yes, our hero of the Exodus

52
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,820
 and the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea.

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,680
 And as we look today how he dealt with it,

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,760
 I am praying for us.

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,440
 That we would each experience a personal Exodus

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,440
 from the need to be busy.

57
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,500
 To be the person who has to do everything

58
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,680
 so that the world continues to take over.

59
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,600
 There is a term which is more and more frequently employed

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,640
 in Christian circles, which depicts a problem

61
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,760
 that has been widespread amongst evangelicals,

62
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,280
 even epidemic.

63
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
 And that term is burnout.

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,800
 Burnout happens frequently to Christian leaders

65
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,880
 who strive to make impossible expectations and demands.

66
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,240
 The achievement of which will show him or her

67
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,860
 to be both spiritual and successful.

68
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,840
 Failure to accomplish these expectations and demands

69
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,160
 is believed to prove one lazy,

70
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,620
 unspiritually minded or a failure.

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,800
 Burnout occurs when in sheer exhaustion and frustration,

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,240
 we lose all hope of meeting the standard

73
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,660
 which is imposed on us either by ourselves, others or both.

74
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,920
 And we simply give up.

75
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,640
 And burnout is not just a phenomenon found

76
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,760
 in Christian leaders or just among Christians

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,520
 for that matter.

78
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,840
 Burnout is caused by the sheer volume

79
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,840
 of non-essential activities, which we foolishly,

80
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,740
 foolishly strive to maintain.

81
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,820
 Are you guilty?

82
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,920
 I know I am.

83
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:02,360
 And Moses' answer comes in the unlikely shape

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,220
 of a visit from his father-in-law.

85
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,560
 I mean, there are lots of mother-in-law jokes,

86
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,760
 but there's very few father-in-law jokes.

87
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:17,880
 Moses was dangerously close to burning himself out

88
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,960
 when of all people, his father-in-law came to his rescue.

89
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,640
 What appears on the surface to be the insignificant visit

90
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,760
 of a relative is really a divine provision

91
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,340
 to deliver Moses.

92
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,760
 Not from the wrath of Pharaoh,

93
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,160
 nor from the attack of the Egyptian army,

94
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,560
 but to deliver him from himself.

95
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,600
 Now as Jethro, that's the name of the father-in-law

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,280
 by the way, it's nothing to do with the vine worship leader.

97
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,240
 As Jethro himself puts it,

98
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,520
 Moses was weary himself and the Israelites out.

99
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,360
 Look at this, verse 18.

100
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,060
 You and these people who come to you

101
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,120
 will only wear yourselves out.

102
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,700
 The work is too heavy for you.

103
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,660
 You cannot handle it alone.

104
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,160
 You cannot handle it alone.

105
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,660
 Thanks to the common sense of a wise father-in-law,

106
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,160
 Moses was delivered from his own destruction.

107
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,360
 The burnout which resulted from a distorted perception

108
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,700
 and a too demanding ministry.

109
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:52,900
 We're gonna be looking today at Exodus 18

110
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,460
 and the text of chapter 18 divides evenly

111
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,300
 into two simple and straightforward portions.

112
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,540
 Verses one to 12, which I will summarize

113
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,140
 by the title Jethro's Arrival.

114
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,140
 And verses 13 to 27, which will depict Jethro's advice.

115
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,460
 The two portions are very much related.

116
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,820
 As a spoiler alert, we will have a film from Egypt

117
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,020
 at the halftime mark and a special guest,

118
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,440
 the vine's own Jethro in part two.

119
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,100
 The first half of the chapter reveals several symptoms

120
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,100
 of a serious problems in Moses' life,

121
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,820
 which prompted not only the arrival of Jethro

122
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,660
 at the Israelites camp, but also his advice.

123
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,780
 We would do well to listen to the wise words

124
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,400
 of this Midianite, who has much to teach us

125
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,360
 about managing our lives and our ministries.

126
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,600
 For those of us like me, who are predisposed

127
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,580
 to busyness and over involvement,

128
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,740
 they can spare us from the deadly disease of burnouts.

129
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,480
 The first section verses one to 12,

130
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,220
 which I've called Jethro's Arrival,

131
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,040
 breaks evenly into two divisions.

132
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,740
 The first division, verses one to six,

133
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,340
 might be entitled Focus on the Family.

134
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,920
 They reveal the occasion,

135
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,880
 the reason for the arrival of Jethro.

136
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,680
 Verse one informs us of the basis

137
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,900
 for Jethro's decision to visit Moses,

138
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,380
 whilst verses two to six tell us

139
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,120
 of the purpose of that visit.

140
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,480
 The second division, verses seven to 12,

141
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,000
 focus on the faith of Jethro.

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,940
 They depict the outcome of Jethro's arrival.

143
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,780
 Moses gets the chance to report

144
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,780
 on God's good hand to the Israelites,

145
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,140
 and Jethro responds to God's goodness to Israel,

146
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,600
 rejoicing, proclaiming God's greatness,

147
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,600
 and worshiping him with Moses and the elders of Israel.

148
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,560
 But this is not the 21st century.

149
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,640
 It's difficult for me to envision

150
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,520
 just how Jethro gathered the information

151
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,720
 about the well-being of Moses.

152
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,260
 There was no Facebook or IG, or even CNN at the time.

153
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,600
 But the text tells us, verse one,

154
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,600
 he heard everything God had done for Moses and his people.

155
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,480
 Perhaps Jethro had made a point to invite travelers,

156
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,080
 even caravans, to share a meal with him,

157
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,960
 or spend the night in his tent,

158
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,480
 enable him to learn the things about Egypt.

159
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,480
 The point of the passage is not how Jethro learned

160
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,440
 of Moses' well-being, but of what he learned.

161
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,520
 He learned that God had protected Moses,

162
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,520
 and that he had delivered the Israelites out of Egypt.

163
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,520
 Jethro had learned enough to conclude

164
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,620
 that the circumstances were such

165
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,620
 that Moses and his family should be reunited.

166
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,640
 And verses two to six indicate the purpose

167
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,340
 of Jethro's visit to Moses, to reunite Zipporah,

168
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,560
 his daughter, Moses' wife, and Gershom and Eliezer,

169
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,560
 the grandsons, Moses' sons, with Moses.

170
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,520
 It was apparently a pleasant surprise for Moses.

171
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,000
 But whilst we might have expected him

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 to pay much more attention to his wife

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,800
 and children coming back, we read that Moses

174
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,440
 is reported to have immediately gone to meet Jethro,

175
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,220
 kissed him, and then go to Jethro's tent to meet with him.

176
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:28,720
 Inside the tent, Moses and Jethro went through

177
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,000
 the formalities of a reception of an honored guest

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,480
 in Oriental culture, in Eastern culture.

179
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,480
 Moses brought Jethro up to date with a detailed report

180
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,520
 of how the hand of God had delivered the Israelites

181
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,920
 and devastated the Egyptians.

182
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,120
 Verse eight, Moses told his father-in-law

183
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,760
 about everything the Lord had done to Pharaoh

184
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,200
 and the Egyptians for Israel's sake,

185
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,160
 and about all the hardships they had met along the way,

186
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,540
 and how the Lord had saved them.

187
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:12,000
 Jethro's response, described in verses nine to 12,

188
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,680
 seems to be more than just Oriental courtesy.

189
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,680
 It appears that Jethro here professes a personal faith

190
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,120
 in the God of Israel, which as a pagan,

191
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,700
 he had not previously.

192
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,060
 First, Jethro rejoiced with Moses, praising God

193
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,240
 for his grace manifested towards Israel

194
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,460
 as evidenced by Moses' report.

195
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,700
 We read this in verse nine and 10.

196
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,580
 Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things

197
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,780
 the Lord had done for Israel in rescuing them

198
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,900
 from the hands of the Egyptian.

199
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,220
 He said, "Praise be to the Lord, who has rescued you

200
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,280
 "from the hands of the Egyptian and of Pharaoh,

201
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,620
 "and who rescued the people from the hands of the Egyptian."

202
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,620
 Secondly, Jethro seems to acknowledge for the first time

203
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,860
 the superiority of God above all other gods,

204
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,500
 which one would have supposed would have included

205
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,420
 his previously worshiped pagan gods.

206
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,360
 Jethro's faith is demonstrated in the offering

207
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,940
 of sacrifices to God and the sacrificial meal,

208
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,940
 which Jethro, Moses, and all the elders of Israel shared.

209
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,920
 Verse 11 says this.

210
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,400
 "Now I know that the Lord is greater

211
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,920
 "than all the other gods, for he did this to those

212
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,760
 "who had treated Israel arrogantly.

213
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,800
 "Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering

214
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,600
 "and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came

215
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,860
 "with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal

216
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,080
 "with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God."

217
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,600
 Therefore, for Moses, this was a happy occasion,

218
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,640
 not only because of Israel's victory over Amalek,

219
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,480
 but because of the renewed fellowship

220
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,440
 and the renewed relationship with his wife and his family.

221
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,740
 But it leads me to a but, and it's a big but.

222
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,740
 Having briefly considered the arrival of Jethro

223
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,820
 and Moses' family and the affirmation of Jethro's faith,

224
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,920
 I'm left with a nagging question.

225
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,940
 Why was it, why was it that Jethro had to initiate

226
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,180
 the reunion of Moses and his family?

227
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,180
 Put it differently, why didn't Moses send

228
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,340
 for his wife and sons, rather than have Jethro

229
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,220
 show up with them unexpectedly?

230
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,340
 Now, we have a tendency, don't we, to assume the best

231
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:10,100
 of our biblical heroes, like Moses, David, Abraham, et cetera.

232
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,780
 I call it the pious bias.

233
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,500
 It seeks to elevate biblical characters

234
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,340
 to a level far above our own performance

235
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,800
 and far above what we would expect, knowing man's nature.

236
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,220
 By the way, not Jesus, I'm saying, okay?

237
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,460
 But when we come to chapter 18, it is not Moses' strengths,

238
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,820
 it is not his virtues, which are extolled in this chapter,

239
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,040
 but his weaknesses.

240
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,040
 Now, here is a man, Moses, that I can identify with,

241
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,760
 a man with flaws like mine.

242
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,080
 And these flaws are keenly observed by Jethro,

243
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,080
 whose advice in verses 13 to 27 is based upon

244
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,240
 his observation of Moses' unconscious blunders,

245
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,840
 both with regard to his family, and as you shall see later,

246
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,500
 his function as Israel's leader.

247
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:22,600
 Let us press on to see how the events of verses one to 12

248
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,160
 serve as a clue to the failures which Jethro seeks to remedy

249
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,460
 by his wisdom and counsel.

250
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,420
 To prepare us, let's go to Egypt,

251
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,080
 and to an interview that Pastor Andrew had

252
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,600
 with Father Justin, not you, by the way.

253
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:51,440
 One of the head monks at St. Catherine's Monastery

254
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,300
 at the foothills of Mount Sinai.

255
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:02,180
 (gentle music)

256
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,840
 (water rushing)

257
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,420
 (gentle music)

258
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,080
 (water rushing)

259
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,660
 (gentle music)

260
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,320
 (water rushing)

261
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,900
 (gentle music)

262
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:26,680
 (water rushing)

263
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:39,260
 (gentle music)

264
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,920
 (water rushing)

265
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:56,180
 - Father Justin, it is such a privilege

266
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,100
 to be with you today and to see this incredible library.

267
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,260
 I can't wait to kind of look around

268
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,180
 and have you show me some of the things that are here.

269
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,580
 - Well, there have been monks living here for 1,700 years.

270
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,580
 The library we have has been slowly built up

271
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,940
 over the centuries, and people have said

272
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,140
 it's the memory of the monastery, so it's a great treasure.

273
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,680
 (gentle music)

274
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,780
 This is the most illuminated manuscript

275
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,180
 of the latter that we have.

276
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,780
 The passage that I opened it to

277
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,220
 is when he discusses discretion.

278
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,460
 He says the greatest gift is discretion

279
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,180
 because discretion is knowing

280
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,420
 how to make spiritual decisions,

281
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,980
 how to weigh things, how to know the way forward.

282
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,820
 And he illustrates that by having three monks.

283
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,060
 The one is still lying in bed, half asleep.

284
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,380
 The other one is middle-aged,

285
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,540
 and he's standing in the center.

286
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,580
 And then the other one has attained, under old age,

287
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,460
 you see his white hair and his beard,

288
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,860
 and he is being crowned by Christ

289
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,580
 who appears from the corner, and he's blessing him.

290
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,060
 - Yeah, I was gonna ask you if that was Christ.

291
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,580
 - So this is the person

292
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,540
 who's just beginning the spiritual life,

293
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,460
 the one who has reached the middle stage,

294
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,460
 and the one who has reached the summit.

295
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,860
 - And when you're fathering the younger monks

296
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,180
 in the monastery here,

297
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,980
 this kind of process of spiritual discipleship, I suppose,

298
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,740
 is that in your mind

299
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,260
 as you're leading the younger monks

300
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,940
 through their life here?

301
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,340
 - One of the beautiful things, not just in monasteries,

302
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,660
 but in the whole Orthodox Church,

303
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,060
 is that we are not expected to do this by ourselves.

304
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,060
 We look to others who have experienced grace,

305
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,980
 who have grown in the Spirit,

306
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,620
 and we follow their example,

307
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,340
 and we receive their instructions.

308
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,260
 So it's an essential part,

309
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,700
 especially at the beginning of the spiritual life,

310
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,180
 to have direction, to have guidance.

311
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,540
 Many times we think that we're doing very well,

312
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,660
 and we're not.

313
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,260
 Many times we think that we're not doing very well at all,

314
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,100
 and we are.

315
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,220
 So it's through experience

316
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,660
 that a person can set us on the right path

317
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,980
 and make sure that we're going in the right direction.

318
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,740
 - Well, I'd love to actually sit down with you

319
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,900
 and talk a little bit more about that relationship

320
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,380
 between being a spiritual father

321
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,540
 and the monks here in the monastery.

322
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,060
 So perhaps we can go and sit down together

323
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,020
 and have a chat. - Fine.

324
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,020
 - Thank you so much for showing me this.

325
00:20:46,020 --> 00:21:00,140
 Father Justin, that manuscript you just showed us

326
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,740
 of the three figures

327
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,060
 kind of in their various different states, I suppose,

328
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,540
 of spiritual maturity,

329
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,860
 really opens up for me a topic

330
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,820
 that I'm very interested in exploring with you

331
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,340
 around that whole sort of sense of being a spiritual father

332
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,860
 within the Orthodox community.

333
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,380
 And I'd love to just get a sense from you,

334
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,140
 what does that look like?

335
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,940
 What does that sort of spiritual father

336
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,180
 to the junior monk relationship look like

337
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,660
 within this community?

338
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,060
 - A monastery usually has one person

339
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,620
 who is very responsible for the spiritual formation,

340
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,900
 especially of those who have just arrived.

341
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,900
 And in Sinai, the senior father

342
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,780
 under the archbishop is called the dikeos.

343
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,700
 The dikeos is a superior.

344
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,460
 And one of his primary obligations

345
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,420
 is the spiritual formation of the novices.

346
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,380
 So that's how he conveys to them the spiritual heritage

347
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,260
 and the spiritual witness of the monastery.

348
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,780
 So when you read the sayings of the desert fathers,

349
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,780
 these are just short anecdotes.

350
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,420
 A person went to a monk and asked him this question,

351
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,700
 he gave this answer.

352
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,100
 And it's profound, and it's just a short saying.

353
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,780
 So they're very approachable,

354
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,540
 but those are some of the earliest monastic texts

355
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,820
 that I read.

356
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,580
 And I was so enthused by everything that I read,

357
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,020
 I was wondering, are there still people

358
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,300
 that live like this?

359
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,980
 That was my own beginnings.

360
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,980
 And I think that everyone goes back to that first experience

361
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,620
 when they think about the monastic life

362
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,260
 and the groundwork that they laid.

363
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,980
 And they understood from experience

364
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,180
 that you have a person who is more mature,

365
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,900
 more experienced, who can guide a person

366
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
 who's just starting out in the spiritual life.

367
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,460
 So that tradition of the elder and the disciple

368
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,660
 goes back to the very beginning.

369
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,980
 The most important book written here at Sinai

370
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,820
 is called "The Ladder of Divine Ascent."

371
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,660
 And if you look carefully, you can see how he was drawing

372
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,820
 on that whole tradition of the Desert Fathers.

373
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,700
 He describes the spiritual life like a ladder,

374
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,500
 when you start for the first rung

375
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,140
 and go to the second rung with Christ at the summit,

376
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,380
 summoning us to make the spiritual ascent.

377
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,540
 And when we first start out, we need care.

378
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,580
 - Right.

379
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,620
 - He mentions that when you have been in a monastery

380
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,380
 for a short time, many times you are thinking,

381
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,980
 well, now I've reached perfection, I can go back home,

382
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,980
 I can become the great preacher, I can bring out a vacation.

383
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,780
 So from the very beginning, you need discretion

384
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,340
 to know which thoughts that are coming to you

385
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,340
 are to your benefit and which ones are undermining your goal.

386
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:56,620
 And you gain that by having an experienced elder

387
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,340
 who can guide you, not only theoretically,

388
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,020
 but based on his own experience.

389
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,900
 One person said, "It's not a little stream

390
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,140
 "that we jump over, it's like a great ocean."

391
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,020
 And no matter how tall a person is,

392
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,500
 when he wades out into the ocean,

393
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,420
 he finds things that are over his head.

394
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,420
 So it's a very profound understanding,

395
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,740
 and it's a process that continues his whole life.

396
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,340
 (gentle music)

397
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:36,260
 - Father Justin, I also wanted to ask you a little bit

398
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,940
 about what a day in the life is like

399
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,900
 for a monk in the monastery here.

400
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,780
 Can you tell me a little bit more about that?

401
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,900
 - It's centered around the services.

402
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,500
 The first service is at four in the morning.

403
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,300
 Four in the morning, all the stars are out

404
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,540
 in the desert sky, and it's beautiful

405
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,020
 to have a service in the quietest part of the day.

406
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,540
 The service lasts until seven o'clock in the morning,

407
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,580
 and by that time, the sun has come up

408
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,340
 and a new day has begun.

409
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,780
 And it's beautiful to watch the light

410
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,140
 slowly increase in the church.

411
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,300
 - And in the service, it's readings?

412
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,900
 - Reading from the Psalms,

413
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,780
 the hymns for the saints of the day.

414
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,460
 We celebrate the liturgy here every day,

415
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,820
 and so that's the morning service.

416
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,660
 We have a short service at noon.

417
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,260
 We have vespers in the afternoon.

418
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,220
 So the beginning, the middle, and the end of the day

419
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,860
 is spent in the services.

420
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,100
 And I think because the community is so small,

421
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,100
 there's a sense that we're more like a family.

422
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,220
 - And what does this family mean to you?

423
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,300
 I mean, you've obviously been a part of this family

424
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,860
 for many years, as you were sharing with us earlier.

425
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,620
 What does it mean for you to actually have

426
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,180
 that kind of family so consistently in your life?

427
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,900
 - There's an amazing balance.

428
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,980
 You have your personal space,

429
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,420
 but you also have this sense of community.

430
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,780
 And the one doesn't intrude on the other.

431
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,500
 I think they're both necessary

432
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,420
 'cause you must be yourself.

433
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:11,420
 There's no, what you would call, institutionalization

434
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,700
 where a person conforms to something.

435
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,860
 A person remains himself, but at the same time,

436
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,660
 he becomes a part of this larger whole.

437
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,940
 And as I mentioned, there's this beautiful balance

438
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,700
 between personal space and being part of a community.

439
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,540
 - Wonderful.

440
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,300
 You're gonna show me some other places in the monastery.

441
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,140
 Shall we go? - Yes.

442
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:49,020
 - Father Justin, I wanted to also ask

443
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,060
 about the wisdom tradition and the role

444
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,660
 that maybe the wisdom books play in your order as well.

445
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,220
 We've talked quite a bit about the Psalms

446
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,180
 and obviously the big influence they have,

447
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,100
 but how does wisdom traditions play within the order?

448
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,820
 - We read the entire book of Proverbs

449
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,340
 during Great Lent in the services.

450
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,940
 And the wisdom that he imparts

451
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,820
 is very much a part of our tradition.

452
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,660
 And there's such a similarity

453
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,260
 between the inherited wisdom

454
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,540
 that is enshrined in the book of Proverbs

455
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,980
 and the sayings of the Desert Fathers,

456
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,980
 which is lived experience, solutions,

457
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,820
 memorable sayings, memorable events

458
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,220
 that have all been collected

459
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,100
 and then passed down from one generation to another.

460
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,100
 The beautiful thing about living at a place like this

461
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,180
 is that every day you have a greater appreciation

462
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,820
 and a greater sense of the significance of the tradition,

463
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,100
 the significance of the place

464
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,380
 and everything that you experience here.

465
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,620
 It's constantly growing and knowledge and wisdom

466
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,700
 and a beautiful process that never has an end.

467
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,020
 - And that's the thing that I think

468
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,900
 you've really impressed on me over our time together

469
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,220
 is that it's this wonderful combination

470
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,700
 between theology, between practice,

471
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,620
 the services of worship you have,

472
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,180
 but then the lived experience

473
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,780
 and doing that in community together.

474
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,780
 And all of that working together

475
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,060
 to really create that spiritual formation as a community.

476
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,500
 I think that's profound.

477
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:39,500
 - Thanks.

478
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,980
 While I'm waiting, that was quite some beard, wasn't it?

479
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,540
 (audience laughing)

480
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,180
 So let's move on with our story.

481
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,900
 The next morning, Moses and the people of Israel

482
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,260
 began their daily routine.

483
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,060
 The people who sought to know God's will from Moses

484
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:03,700
 began to line up at the designated place,

485
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,420
 perhaps just outside Moses' tent.

486
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,660
 With a nation composed, as Andrew told us in previous weeks,

487
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,100
 of nearly two million people,

488
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,580
 one could imagine the line was long

489
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:24,220
 and that it began to queue up very early in the morning.

490
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,020
 I don't know if it's four o'clock or not.

491
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,540
 Moses, we are told, seated himself

492
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:37,180
 sitting as Israel's sole judge.

493
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,020
 Let's read this.

494
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,780
 The next day, Moses took his seat

495
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,700
 to serve as judge for the people.

496
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,620
 And they stood around him from morning till evening.

497
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,780
 When his father-in-law saw all that Moses

498
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,820
 was doing for the people, he said,

499
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,300
 what is this that you're doing for the people?

500
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,020
 Why do you alone sit as judge?

501
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,980
 Why are all these people stand around you

502
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,420
 from morning until evening?

503
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,340
 You see, the people came to him with all those matters

504
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,820
 which needed a decision, an instruction, or counsel.

505
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,580
 The people looked to Moses alone for a word from God

506
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,220
 for guidance in their lives.

507
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,740
 At the end of the day,

508
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,380
 the long line of waiting Israelites was still there.

509
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:39,380
 Jethro was able to quickly identify the problem

510
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,660
 to which it seems Moses was oblivious.

511
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,580
 Jethro was baffled by the inefficiency

512
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,660
 of what had taken place during the day.

513
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,340
 So perhaps over dinner that night,

514
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,140
 they sat around and Jethro began to inquire

515
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,260
 about Moses' rationale for administering justice,

516
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,460
 judging as he was doing.

517
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,460
 It was apparent from Jethro's questioning

518
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,140
 that he did not agree with the way

519
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,460
 that Moses was doing things.

520
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,260
 Even the way the questions are phrased in writing,

521
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,220
 you can imagine the tone of voice which he asked.

522
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,820
 Father-in-law, as you know,

523
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,900
 can do a better job than others on this.

524
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,020
 He usually starts with a question.

525
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,100
 Are you a good enough man to be my daughter's husband?

526
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:40,140
 I believe Moses was completely caught off guard

527
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,620
 by Jethro's disapproval.

528
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,820
 Moses was so engrossed in his work,

529
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,020
 so desperately trying to keep his head above water

530
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,860
 that he didn't have time to reflect on what he was doing.

531
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,780
 Jethro, on the other hand,

532
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:04,780
 had already suspected a problem for some time.

533
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,580
 Moses had not only sent his family home

534
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,300
 for Jethro to care for,

535
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,500
 but apparently he'd had little contact with them

536
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,200
 and he delayed in reuniting with his family.

537
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,840
 That morning, Jethro began to see the pieces

538
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,100
 fall into place.

539
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,020
 Moses had not sent for his family.

540
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,860
 Why?

541
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,740
 Because he did not have time to care for them,

542
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,400
 even to think of them.

543
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:46,220
 The response of Moses reveals his distorted perception,

544
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,380
 which was the root problem here.

545
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,180
 Moses answered him,

546
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,980
 because the people come to me to seek God's will.

547
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,500
 Whenever they have a dispute,

548
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,500
 it is brought to me and I decide between the parties

549
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,500
 and inform them of God's decrees and instruction.

550
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,180
 While Jethro quickly sized up the situation,

551
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,700
 Moses wasn't thinking very carefully

552
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,220
 about what he was doing.

553
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,220
 His response reveals several misconceptions

554
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,360
 regarding his role as a leader.

555
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,580
 Consider them with me for a moment.

556
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,580
 Firstly, Moses believed that every request for help

557
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:38,540
 made the matter his responsibility.

558
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:43,260
 Secondly, Moses seemed to assume

559
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:48,860
 that because the people came to him personally for help,

560
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:53,380
 it was his responsibility to help them personally.

561
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,260
 Thirdly, Moses wrongly reasoned that because his task

562
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,780
 was to lead the entire nation,

563
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,180
 he must do it by dealing with people one at a time.

564
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:11,780
 Fourthly, Moses seemed to have assumed that no one else,

565
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,820
 no one else was able to do what he was doing.

566
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:20,900
 And most importantly, Moses seems to have lost sight

567
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,160
 of his unique gifts and calling.

568
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,120
 Let me repeat that.

569
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,480
 Moses seems to have lost sight

570
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,920
 of his unique gifts and calling.

571
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,960
 God had not called Moses to do everything,

572
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,880
 but to do some things.

573
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,460
 Moses was given responsibility

574
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,920
 to lead the nation of Israel as a whole.

575
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,840
 And therefore, his task was very different

576
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,440
 from that of others who could deal with people

577
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,440
 on a personal, intimate, one-on-one basis.

578
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:08,980
 I believe that we can gather several important principles

579
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,520
 of leadership from the words of Jethro

580
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,360
 which are addressed to Moses.

581
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:21,620
 And to help me, I want to introduce my very own Jethro.

582
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,520
 Not my father-in-law.

583
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,480
 But a wise, can I say older?

584
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,300
 Okay, you know we're 150 between us,

585
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,980
 you know, just telling you that.

586
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,540
 You gotta work out how that's balanced out.

587
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:45,540
 But God sent this man to me

588
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,480
 and to this church to impart common sense

589
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,040
 and generational wisdom.

590
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,160
 Tony will address these principles

591
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,880
 and their practical information.

592
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,980
 So let's welcome Tony.

593
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,140
 [audience applauding]

594
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,040
 >> Well, thank you.

595
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,660
 It's good to be here and to be able to talk on this as well.

596
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,700
 We need to hear now, not from Moses' problems,

597
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,180
 but to Jethro's advice.

598
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,620
 And we're gonna do that firstly by reading

599
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,180
 exactly what it was that Jethro said.

600
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,180
 So here in chapter 18, Jethro is speaking

601
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,820
 and he's speaking to Moses.

602
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,140
 And he says this.

603
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:41,140
 Listen now to me and I will give you some advice

604
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,860
 and may God be with you.

605
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,360
 You, you must be the people's representative before God

606
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,920
 and bring their disputes to him.

607
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,820
 Teach them his decrees and instructions

608
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,340
 and show them the way that they should live.

609
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:06,400
 But select capable men from all the people,

610
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,960
 men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain,

611
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,840
 and appoint them as officials over thousands,

612
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,680
 hundreds, fifties, and tens.

613
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,120
 Have them serve as judges for the people at all times.

614
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:27,280
 But for the simple cases, they can decide themselves.

615
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,860
 That will make your load lighter

616
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,020
 because they will share it with you.

617
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,480
 If you do this and God so commands,

618
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,800
 you will be able to stand the strain

619
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,380
 and all these people will go home satisfied.

620
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,620
 Now we need to just step back a moment here

621
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,200
 and see that what Moses was doing

622
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,900
 was hindering the fundamental reason

623
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,200
 that the people were on this journey.

624
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,060
 They were on this journey to seek their freedom.

625
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,280
 It was for freedom that they were in the desert

626
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,900
 and leading to that promised land.

627
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,680
 Jethro is sensing, quite rightly,

628
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,880
 that their journey of freedom

629
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,880
 is turning into one of resentment and exhaustion.

630
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,880
 I want to summarize the advice

631
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,040
 by bringing out four general principles of leadership.

632
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
 The first one of these

633
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,700
 is the principle of control and release.

634
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,060
 Now you might think from a quick reading of this passage

635
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,900
 that Jethro's advice was intended to release Moses

636
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,300
 and to maintain control of the people.

637
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,660
 But actually, it was the other way around

638
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,260
 because the principle role of Christian leadership

639
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,260
 is to lead people out of slavery and into freedom.

640
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,900
 In order to do this effectively,

641
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,900
 the leader must maintain control of themselves first

642
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,580
 and not the people.

643
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,900
 And when the leader is in control of himself or herself,

644
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,840
 then the people will respond and follow.

645
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,620
 If it's not done well,

646
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,500
 then the leaders will have difficulty in leading

647
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,700
 because of the lack of confidence

648
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,260
 that they perceive in the leader himself.

649
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,180
 And Jethro's advice to Moses

650
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,240
 involved a specific sort of pyramid arrangement

651
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,880
 of organizational model.

652
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,700
 And it was designed to relieve the burden on Moses, yes,

653
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,540
 but also to release the people into leadership.

654
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,980
 And that model perhaps was appropriate

655
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,240
 for slaves who had only experienced slavery

656
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,060
 in their lifetime,

657
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,260
 but it was not an ordained model

658
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,300
 that was divinely appointed

659
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,020
 for all Christian assemblies thereafter.

660
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,720
 The significant thing about Jethro's advice

661
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,720
 was in its outcome to restore the journey of freedom

662
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,400
 and not in the specific organizational model

663
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,240
 that he spoke about.

664
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,620
 So the first principle of leadership is this,

665
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:23,400
 that leaders need to be in control of themselves first

666
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,760
 before they can release others.

667
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,100
 The second principle I want to talk about

668
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,840
 is the principle of the servant and master.

669
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,020
 You see, God has given each of us giftings

670
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,780
 which we can use in our leadership.

671
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,900
 But leadership itself is not a specific gift from God

672
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,480
 because there are many different types of leadership.

673
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,020
 But Jethro provides some solid advice to Moses

674
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,960
 on how to exercise his specific role

675
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,560
 and how he should release the people into their role.

676
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,720
 But more importantly, he gave him some advice

677
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,860
 on the qualities of the people

678
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,120
 that he should be looking for.

679
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,400
 He said, "But select capable men,

680
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,820
 "men from all the people who secondly fear God,

681
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,620
 "thirdly, who are trustworthy,

682
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,900
 "and men who hate dishonest gain."

683
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,280
 And that would be the sense of having

684
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,580
 a sense of justice within their heart.

685
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,360
 And Jethro wanted to make sure that these men

686
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,280
 would be able to carry out their duties as servants

687
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,300
 and not as overlords or masters.

688
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,560
 We might use different wording in our Christian context,

689
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,560
 but these qualities of servanthood

690
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,160
 that he outlined are important

691
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,960
 no matter what sort of leadership gifting that we have.

692
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,120
 And it's in this context of servanthood

693
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,560
 that we need to work on the basic skills and gifts

694
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,560
 that God has given us so that we can master those gifts

695
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,640
 and use them well in leadership itself.

696
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,560
 Some leaders are gifted organizational managers.

697
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,120
 Some are inspirational speakers.

698
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,560
 Others may be knowledgeable scholars.

699
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,280
 Others may use authenticity

700
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,640
 and life experience to lead others.

701
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,040
 There are many ways of types of leadership

702
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,880
 that we can experience and use.

703
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,560
 But whatever type of leadership you have,

704
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,200
 then the second principle of leadership is this.

705
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,200
 Leaders are called to lead as servants of Christ

706
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,000
 by mastering the gifts that they have been given.

707
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,600
 And the third principle I want to talk to

708
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,880
 is that of the shepherd and the sheep.

709
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,560
 In a church setting, the role of the shepherd

710
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,680
 is to lead the flock to safe pastures

711
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,680
 where they can be cared for and protected.

712
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,640
 In doing this, she or he is providing

713
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,960
 a collective leadership for the flock.

714
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,860
 But what happens if one of the sheep

715
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,400
 goes astray and gets lost?

716
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,200
 Well, we know from our New Testament parables

717
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,480
 that in that occasion, the shepherd goes

718
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,680
 and leaves the 99 to find the one.

719
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,840
 But in a large church, it will be impossible

720
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,880
 for one leader to know each individual person

721
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,920
 by name and their circumstances.

722
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,160
 And just as Jethro suggested,

723
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,000
 it will be important to train up other leaders

724
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,760
 who can provide that important element

725
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,080
 of personal engagement and shepherding.

726
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:08,080
 And this is why the development of communities is important.

727
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,240
 In Moses' day, it was possible for him

728
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,200
 to use the natural structure of the tribes

729
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,680
 and families that existed around them.

730
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,360
 But in our highly mobile societies,

731
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,320
 we need to be much more intentional

732
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,400
 in developing and nurturing communities

733
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,880
 where people can find greater spiritual

734
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,580
 and relational support.

735
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,040
 And so at the Vine, we place great importance

736
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,160
 to our community groups as places

737
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,280
 where people can experience and learn

738
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,920
 and how to engage with different personalities and cultures.

739
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,720
 It's in that setting that we can learn

740
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,440
 how to support each other, sharing life together,

741
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,880
 and putting into practice the teachings that we receive.

742
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,240
 These groups are great incubators

743
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,540
 to learn leadership skills and to exercise our gifts

744
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,680
 and to grow in spiritual maturity.

745
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,480
 So the third principle of leadership is this.

746
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,800
 Shepherding is the caring and nurturing of the sheep

747
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,160
 so that they can in turn become the shepherds of others.

748
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,580
 And the fourth and final principle

749
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,680
 that I want to talk about

750
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,680
 is the principle of the one and many.

751
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,120
 Because at whatever level of leadership we find ourselves,

752
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,320
 we need to learn how to manage ourselves

753
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,220
 and how to manage others.

754
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,440
 And I'm not talking about having to get an MBA here,

755
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,880
 but I'm talking about the basic skills

756
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,280
 of organizing ourselves and our activities

757
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,520
 to achieve our goals.

758
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,120
 As our responsibilities increase,

759
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,240
 we will undoubtedly need to interact with others

760
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,240
 in teamwork and shared leadership situations

761
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,840
 become the requirement of the day.

762
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,840
 You see, leadership is rarely a solo activity

763
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:20,560
 because of the sheer complexity of the lives we lead

764
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,780
 and the situations that we find ourselves in.

765
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,360
 And at the Vine, we have many levels

766
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,680
 of shared leadership responsibilities.

767
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,640
 We practice shared leadership in our staff organization.

768
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,880
 We practice it in our eldership

769
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,600
 and in all of our ministries where possible.

770
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,840
 And at one time in the past,

771
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,160
 the church was even run by an eldership

772
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,780
 as a shared leadership responsibility

773
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,200
 without any full-time pastors at all.

774
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,800
 And our first full-time pastoral leadership

775
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,440
 was a dual appointment of John and myself

776
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,640
 as co-senior pastors

777
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,920
 in which we led the church together

778
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,500
 and using our complimentary gifts.

779
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,200
 And I say this only to emphasize

780
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,200
 that shared leadership is very much in our blood as a church

781
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,800
 and from it, we can learn so much about life and ourselves.

782
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,940
 So the fourth and final principle of leadership is this.

783
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:30,700
 Church leadership is seldom a solo activity.

784
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,560
 Practicing shared leadership together

785
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,680
 will produce a healthy, growing community.

786
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,520
 Thank you.

787
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,120
 (audience applauding)

788
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:50,480
 - The principles which Moses learned from Jethro

789
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,040
 are applicable to every Christian,

790
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,480
 whether he or she is a leader or not.

791
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,300
 So as we conclude, I wanna consider some initial steps

792
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,020
 which may get us started on our way

793
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,700
 to becoming better leaders and managers.

794
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,180
 Number one is simple.

795
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,420
 Find a Jethro.

796
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:22,060
 God gave Moses a Jethro to point out his problems.

797
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,980
 Fortunately, God gave me a Jethro in Tony and others.

798
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,700
 If you do not have such a friend, get one.

799
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:39,400
 Number two, establish a plan for both your private world

800
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,300
 and your public ministry

801
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,200
 and determine not to neglect either.

802
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,160
 This is big.

803
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,620
 Determine the priorities which will govern those things

804
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:58,620
 that you will do and those you will turn down.

805
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:04,460
 Of all the things you could do,

806
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:10,300
 seek to identify and achieve those things you should do.

807
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:16,460
 Number three, determine to facilitate

808
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:20,460
 the ministry of others, especially by encouraging

809
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,340
 and equipping them to do what they do best.

810
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:28,340
 In other words, begin to focus as a Jethro.

811
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,000
 Now, I know I've asked you just to find a Jethro,

812
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,100
 but begin to focus as a Jethro

813
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,260
 to the many Moseses around you.

814
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:44,180
 And lastly, desire to grow in faith

815
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,720
 and at the same time, humility.

816
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,760
 Faith is required to trust God to enable you

817
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,180
 to do what he's called you to do.

818
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,940
 Faith is also required to enable you to leave

819
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,800
 what you should not do to others.

820
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,060
 Humility will keep you from self-trust,

821
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,800
 will prevent you from taking credit

822
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,380
 for what God has accomplished.

823
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,700
 It will also enable you to resist

824
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,380
 the ego-flattering suggestions

825
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:25,380
 that only you are the solution to a particular problem.

826
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:31,900
 My friends, you are not able to go it alone.

827
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,900
 Talk to the person next to you.

828
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:40,900
 Tell them, you are not able to go it alone.

829
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,360
 As I ask our band to come back,

830
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:50,920
 our story has a happy ending.

831
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,100
 Let's see it.

832
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,500
 Verse 24.

833
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:01,580
 Moses listened to his father-in-law

834
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,600
 and did everything he said.

835
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,340
 Amen, let's stand up.

836
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,760
 (congregation laughing)

837
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:18,140
 What I wanna do now is to pray for us.

838
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:23,160
 We're just gonna have some music playing in the background.

839
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,940
 But this is really your time.

840
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:28,140
 As we prayed before the service,

841
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:32,780
 we had this picture of an ice cube that was melting

842
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,900
 and felt that really all of us need today

843
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:42,660
 to just allow God to melt away on the extremes for us.

844
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:46,740
 I'm gonna ask that God would give to you

845
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:52,500
 maybe a picture, a name of someone you need to be asked

846
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,480
 to be your Jephro, it may be more than one person.

847
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,420
 Also that God would put in your mind

848
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:04,080
 people that you need to get alongside,

849
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,640
 you need to encourage.

850
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:13,580
 Let's pray.

851
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:18,440
 Holy Spirit,

852
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:25,000
 we pray that you do a work in each one of our lives today.

853
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,060
 We thank you for this story

854
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:33,460
 of how a father-in-law

855
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,480
 was used by you

856
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:40,560
 to change the life of Moses

857
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,980
 and by definition change the life of a relation.

858
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:49,800
 Come to me now,

859
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,760
 Lord, and start to show me

860
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,600
 maybe there are things in my life

861
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:03,200
 that I'm doing that I need to stop doing.

862
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,440
 (gentle music)

863
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:12,540
 Lord, help me to find a Jephro

864
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:16,460
 and help me, Lord, to be a Jephro

865
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,300
 to the next generation.

866
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:24,020
 And as a church, Lord, we ask you

867
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:30,540
 that you would make us this church of cross generations

868
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,620
 (gentle music)

869
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:37,640
 Lord, how you would allow us.

870
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,240
 We thank you, Lord, for the young people in this church,

871
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,240
 the sharp end, the energy,

872
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,240
 the desire to get things done.

873
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:56,840
 Help us to be ones who would get around them,

874
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,100
 to empower them, to encourage them.

875
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,720
 (gentle music)

876
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,560
 And if necessary, show them the way.

877
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,560
 We thank you, Lord, for the many families

878
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,540
 you're raising up in this church,

879
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:14,180
 in some ways the backbone of the church.

880
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:20,800
 I pray, Lord, you'd help us

881
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,100
 in this area of family priorities.

882
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:28,400
 So often in Hong Kong, Lord, we let business,

883
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,400
 we let church, we let things that we deem to be important

884
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,100
 get in the way of our families.

885
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:42,280
 And we pray, Lord, that you continue to raise up

886
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:49,960
 wise people, Lord, sometimes older, sometimes not,

887
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,880
 but people who can just give us direction in life.

888
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,460
 (gentle music)

889
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:01,880
 So Holy Spirit, I just wait on you now.

890
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,300
 Would you speak to me?

891
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,800
 Would you speak to us as a church?

892
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,360
 And actually, would you speak to us

893
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,960
 as a city here in Hong Kong?

894
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,980
