1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 in its ongoing sentence.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,100
 A time of service, love, and engagement

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,180
 that inspires and emboldens all equally

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,380
 for the conversation that lies ahead.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,500
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,820
 This is our city.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,340
 This is our church.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,620
 This is our home.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,920
 - Good morning and welcome to the Wein-Yun Long.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,400
 My name is Tim, I'm one of the pastors here.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,560
 It is so good to see you.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,960
 Today we have some exciting plans.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,960
 Does anyone know what we're doing today?

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,360
 Barbecue, that's right.

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
 I'm so excited.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,360
 I heard people are bringing British football,

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,040
 American football, and of course there'll be good food.

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,520
 But I'm not just excited because of the barbecue.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,520
 I'm also excited because you are here.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,960
 God's word is very clear,

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,440
 that every person who knows Jesus

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,520
 is indwelled by the Holy Spirit.

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,920
 But then there is something that happens

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,040
 when people come together as the church.

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,840
 God indwells the gathering of God's people

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,920
 in a special way.

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,160
 And so I wanna ask and invite us to prepare our hearts

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,080
 as we enter into worship here in just a moment.

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,420
 That we come expectant that the Holy Spirit wants to move,

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,720
 wants to meet us through the preaching,

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,380
 through the worship, through prayer,

32
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,960
 and that we come expectant and encounter him.

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,360
 But then the second thing I was thinking about

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,140
 was bringing our best in worship to him today.

35
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,120
 Now what does it mean to bring our best in worship?

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,840
 I think it probably means different things

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,880
 for different people.

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,920
 Perhaps the fact that you showed up is already incredible.

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,000
 Maybe you've had a difficult week and you're here,

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
 you know, praise God.

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,120
 So your presence is part of your worship.

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,080
 Maybe offering our best worship

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,920
 means this yielding and surrendering to God again.

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,920
 Maybe it means really thinking about what we're singing

45
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,560
 as we lift up our voices and praise to God.

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,280
 So I wanna invite us to bring our best right now

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,840
 to God as we're gonna worship.

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,560
 So I wanna invite you all to stand

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,280
 and I wanna pray for us.

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,280
 Heavenly Father, thank you so much

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,480
 for every single person that you have brought.

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,960
 Thank you, Holy Spirit, that you indwell your people,

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,360
 that you indwell your church, that you are here.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,320
 Right now we wanna lift up your name.

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,240
 We want your name to be lifted high.

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,400
 We wanna praise you, we wanna glorify you.

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,800
 We wanna sing of your beauty and who you are

58
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
 and declare that.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,600
 And so may you be pleased and honored.

60
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,840
 I pray this in your name, Jesus, amen.

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,600
 Let's worship.

62
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,520
 Amen.

 that you prepare a room to receive you in a new way

377
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,840
 All right. Time to bring it back.

378
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,840
 I love that everyone's talking to each other. That's always a good sign, right?

379
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,840
 That we're excited to see each other, excited to meet each other.

380
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,840
 There are several things that I want to keep you updated about.

381
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,840
 The first thing is today's barbecue.

382
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,840
 Anyone excited about today's barbecue?

383
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,840
 Yes, I am. I'm ready. Ready for Hong Kong-style barbecue.

384
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,840
 Just some information on that.

385
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
 We can go to the next slide.

386
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,840
 If you signed up to join us today, the bus will be leaving.

387
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
 There's Thai Fat Thai restaurant.

388
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,840
 If you walk down the stairs and turn to the right, it's green.

389
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840
 The bus will pick us up.

390
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,840
 I think the bus number has changed, so they gave us a different plate number now.

391
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,840
 But if you can make your way there by 1 o'clock, that would be awesome.

392
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,840
 So make your way there by 1 o'clock so we can start boarding the bus, which will take a while.

393
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,840
 Also, if you have not signed up to join the barbecue, but you would like to,

394
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,840
 you can let us know and we'll try to help you to go.

395
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,840
 Now, the bus is quite full.

396
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,840
 We might not have a space there, but there's other ways you can travel to the barbecue site

397
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,840
 and also purchase the ticket to join there as well.

398
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,840
 You can let us know if you want to do that.

399
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,840
 And Dora, is Dora here?

400
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
 Right over there, yes.

401
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,840
 She'll be checking us in and everything, so you can look for Dora as you also go to the bus.

402
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,840
 All right.

403
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
 Going to the next thing.

404
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,840
 On Christmas, we have two Sunday services.

405
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
 We're really excited about that.

406
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
 We have our children perform, which will be awesome.

407
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
 It will be cute.

408
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,840
 It will be a one-hour service.

409
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,840
 So the first one is Cantonese service 930.

410
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,840
 The second one is the English service.

411
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,840
 It will be a great time to invite family, friends, maybe people you're already spending time on Christmas with anyhow.

412
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:31,840
 And after the Christmas service, we'll have a cookie feast.

413
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
 So that's the next thing.

414
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:45,840
 And what that is, basically we just want to extend hospitality to anyone who comes, want to celebrate, greet each other, bless each other on Christmas, on that special day, and hang out a bit with each other.

415
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,840
 Now, the cookie feast, this is us as a church hosting people who are joining.

416
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,840
 So this is not just the pastoral team hosting people.

417
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,840
 This is all of us hosting and welcoming people to this community.

418
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:08,840
 So that means we want to greet people, welcome them, but also if you have something you can bring, whether that is -- and it doesn't have to be home-baked cookies.

419
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
 Maybe it's something purchased.

420
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
 Maybe it's fruit.

421
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,840
 It doesn't have to be cookies either.

422
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,840
 It wouldn't hurt me to eat a little healthier.

423
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
 Something savory.

424
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,840
 Just something to bless people.

425
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,840
 Something that you enjoy that you would love to share with somebody else.

426
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,840
 So please sign up so we can make sure we're extending good hospitality on those days.

427
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
 So that would be awesome.

428
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,840
 And, yeah, the next thing is our offering.

429
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
 So this is part of our worship.

430
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,840
 On your seats there were envelopes, or at least close by.

431
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,840
 The envelopes have all information of different ways of how you can give.

432
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,840
 So you're welcome to take those home as well if you need that information.

433
00:28:49,840 --> 00:29:02,840
 So your giving helps us to carry out this mission that we have here in Yuen Long of loving and serving people here, of caring for children, building them up in faith, growing people as a congregation.

434
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:10,840
 And so thank you so much for faithfully giving and blessing us so we can continue to do this work here.

435
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:18,840
 Once the buckets have passed around, I would love to pray for our offering, but I'll just wait until they've been passed around.

436
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:42,840
 [Music]

437
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,840
 All right, I'm going to pray for us.

438
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
 Let's pray.

439
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,840
 Jesus, we, yeah, thank you that you provide everything for us.

440
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,840
 Everything we have is a gift from you, and we give you praise, and we offer up our giving to you.

441
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:07,840
 And we ask that you use it for your purpose, for your kingdom's purpose, that you multiply it, and that our work here and our service in the city will bear fruit.

442
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
 We pray this in your name, Jesus.

443
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
 Amen.

444
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
 Amen.

445
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,840
 Hey, right now I'm excited to invite up Pastor Chapman.

446
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
 And so he's going to come up.

447
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,840
 He's continuing today in our sermons.

448
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
 Here's Christmas.

449
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,840
 A little play on words, so it's messy.

450
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
 But I would love to pray for him, pray for us.

451
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,840
 So let's do that.

452
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,840
 Jesus, thank you so much for Pastor Chapman.

453
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,840
 Thank you for his preparation of bringing the word that you placed on his heart for us today.

454
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,840
 I pray for your anointing on him as he teaches us.

455
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:56,840
 We also pray and ask that you give us hearts that are open, that are good soil so we can receive the words that you have for us.

456
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
 So we pray all this in your name, Jesus.

457
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
 Amen.

458
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
 Amen.

459
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
 Thank you, Pastor Tim.

460
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
 Can we put our hands together for Pastor Tim?

461
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,840
 So good to see you all once again.

462
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:17,840
 You know, next year, around summertime, next summer, it marks 20 years since God first called me to full-time ministry.

463
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:28,840
 In 2004, I was 16, and I just finished public exam in Hong Kong, and my youth pastor brought me and some of my friends from church to a youth summer camp.

464
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
 I was in Wukai Sha, a thousand people.

465
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
 It was really packed.

466
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
 The worship was amazing.

467
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,840
 I remember a little bit what the preachers was talking about, but then I remember the worship in particular.

468
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,840
 I still remember what songs we sing, and I remember what I saw, the pictures that I saw in worship.

469
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
 And one of those was like this.

470
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,840
 When I was worshiping God, I just saw this picture of Jesus walking towards me slowly.

471
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,840
 When he reached me, he stretched out his arms, his nail-piece arms towards me.

472
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,840
 The next thing I remember, I was wailing and wailing and wailing.

473
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,840
 It's kind of like God is filling me with his love like never before.

474
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,840
 I just keep wailing like there's this waterfall of God's love like crushing me.

475
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
 And then I heard this.

476
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:27,840
 This is just a voice in my head saying, "Are you willing to give me the rest of your life to follow me, to serve me?"

477
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,840
 All right, I need to tell you something about me first.

478
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,840
 So when I was born, not long after I was born, my mom found out that she had cancer.

479
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
 And it was in the hospital that she accepted Jesus.

480
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,840
 That's how me and my family, we started going to church.

481
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,840
 But when the day I turned three, she passed away.

482
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,840
 She went home to be with the Lord.

483
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,840
 And so if you ask me, ever since I was three years old, "Chapman, what would you like to do with your life?"

484
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,840
 I would tell you 100% I wanted to be a doctor.

485
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
 Simple.

486
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
 I want to help people.

487
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,840
 I want to help people to prevent like things that happened to my mom would happen to them.

488
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,840
 That's my dream, my aspiration, if you will.

489
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,840
 But somehow when I was in that young youth camp, summer camp in 2004, when I was worshipping,

490
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,840
 when I heard these words, "Would you follow me for the rest of your life and serve me?"

491
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,840
 Somehow, I know I have this dream or aspiration, but saying yes to God was like a no-brainer.

492
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,840
 I said yes.

493
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,840
 And there's this part of me inside thinking, "Yeah, I think I'm quite capable."

494
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
 You know, I was in a pretty good school in New Territories.

495
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,840
 I lived in Tsuen Wan when I grew up.

496
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,840
 I was in a better class in school, so I'm quite capable.

497
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,840
 If God wants to call someone, yeah, of course it would be me.

498
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,840
 Little did I know that my life was going to turn upside down.

499
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:00,840
 When I got into university, I was this Christian young man on fire for God,

500
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,840
 so I would go to the Christian fellowship, I'd go to campus crusades, whatever the meetings are,

501
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,840
 prayer meetings, I went to all the Christian events and meetings that I could ever heard of.

502
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:18,840
 So people, when they see me on the outside, I'm this very spiritual, very on fire young man for Jesus,

503
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,840
 but they don't know what's going on inside of me.

504
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,840
 Actually, I was struggling with my studies.

505
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:34,840
 So after one or two semesters in university, I started not being able to meet deadlines of my assignments,

506
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,840
 and I failed one or two classes, and I became so ashamed of myself.

507
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:46,840
 I thought I should be living the perfect Christian life, like every single area of my life should be perfect.

508
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,840
 I should be the one telling people, you know what, God called me to be a pastor one day,

509
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,840
 so now I am leading a perfect life. Come on, let's see.

510
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,840
 I thought that would be the way, but it was the total opposite, and I was so ashamed of myself.

511
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,840
 So I started to distance myself from my friends.

512
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,840
 I didn't want them to see what's going on with me. I don't want to face them.

513
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,840
 And I started to skip classes.

514
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,840
 I remember there was one day I had this particular class.

515
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
 We have certain level, a standard of attendance.

516
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,840
 If I skip another class, I would just fail the entire course one more time.

517
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,840
 So that day I had an 8.30 a.m. class.

518
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:31,840
 When I woke up and looked at the clock, it was 9.09 a.m.

519
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:40,840
 Well, luckily I stayed in dorm, like it's a 10-minute run, not walk, 10-minute run, so I rushed to the classroom.

520
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:46,840
 I was like jogging or running, and I'm like, "Ah, ah, ah, finally reached the door."

521
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,840
 It's very simple. All I have to do is open the door, grab a seat.

522
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,840
 Nobody's going to see me. Just pay attention, and then that's it.

523
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:02,840
 But when I was standing at the door, this huge fear just started to overwhelm me.

524
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,840
 I started to have these mental rehearsals of people, how they're going to look at me,

525
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:14,840
 my classmates, what they're going to say about me, and I was just frozen at the door.

526
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,840
 But then I remember I'm a Christian. I can pray to God about these kind of things.

527
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,840
 So I gathered my courage to pray. I said, "God, please help me. I don't know what to do right now.

528
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,840
 I should go in, but I don't want to go in. I don't know what to do."

529
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,840
 And I prayed, and after one minute, no, I'm still very afraid I have to pray again.

530
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,840
 So I prayed for two minutes. I prayed for three minutes, four minutes, and five minutes

531
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,840
 until eventually I gathered all my strength and courage.

532
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:48,840
 I turned back. I went back to my dorm, and I slept.

533
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:58,840
 I slept for two weeks. I didn't see people. I didn't get out of my room.

534
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,840
 I didn't take a shower. I don't know you've been there, that you slept so much

535
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,840
 until your head hurts, you must get up, because if you keep lying down here,

536
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,840
 your head is hurting. That's what happened to me.

537
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,840
 When I woke up, I would just go and take a cup noodle, eat it, and then I continued to lie down.

538
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:24,840
 Later on, I figured out, or someone told me, that's called depression.

539
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,840
 At the end of that semester, I dropped out of school, and I told myself,

540
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,840
 God called me to be a pastor, not doing some other whatever that is.

541
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,840
 So maybe if I go to a seminary, things will be different.

542
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,840
 So I got the guts to sign up, apply for a seminary, and that seminary accepted me.

543
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:49,840
 And so I started, I thought, okay, now I'm living out my calling, but guess what?

544
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,840
 The whole thing, the whole cycle repeated itself.

545
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:00,840
 I failed to meet deadlines again, I skipped classes again, I dropped out once again.

546
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,840
 At the age of 23, I dropped out of school twice, I was sitting on the bus,

547
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,840
 the upper deck of the bus, because I was so ashamed of myself, even if I take a bus,

548
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,840
 I would stay at the back of the upper deck.

549
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:18,840
 And I look out the window, and these words came out of my mouth.

550
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:25,840
 I asked God, God, have I heard you, like, wrongly? Did I hear you wrongly?

551
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,840
 Did I make a mistake, or have you made a mistake?

552
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:34,840
 Because I could never be the one that you called.

553
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:44,840
 You see, second guessing, or doubts, questioning ourselves, questioning even God,

554
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:52,840
 this is just almost like a reflex when we hit a brick wall or face immense challenge or failures in life.

555
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:58,840
 Doubt is something that almost every single person experience at a certain point in their life.

556
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,840
 If we look at the dictionary definition of the word doubt, it says this,

557
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,840
 doubt is the feeling of uncertainty or lack of conviction.

558
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,840
 When I was 16, I was pretty convinced that God has called me into ministry to be a pastor.

559
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,840
 But as I hit one wall after another, as I failed one time after another,

560
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,840
 my level of conviction just started to go downhill until by the time I was 23,

561
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:31,840
 if there is a tank that contains my faith, I would say that tank was completely empty.

562
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
 I lack conviction.

563
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:42,840
 I was uncertain if God has said those very words to me in the first place in that summer camp.

564
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,840
 Perhaps you've been faithful at your job, you worked really hard,

565
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,840
 but you didn't get the promotion you expected or you deserved.

566
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:58,840
 Or maybe you've been praying for healing or for the well-being of someone you really love.

567
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,840
 You've been praying day and night for that, yet, or maybe it's a family member,

568
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,840
 yet you're there at the hospital watching them suffer.

569
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:13,840
 Or you may even be following God faithfully and in your everyday life and serving faithfully at church,

570
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:22,840
 diligently pour out your time, your resources, your energy, your love, but in the end, you're hurt.

571
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,840
 You thought, "Nobody really understands me. People hurt me."

572
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,840
 And you're so discouraged by people at church or even maybe you're so discouraged by God himself

573
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,840
 that you were wondering if you should just walk away.

574
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:44,840
 Modern psychologists, they view doubt as a natural part of human experience.

575
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:52,840
 It arises within us because we have this ability to think critically and question our surroundings.

576
00:40:52,840 --> 00:41:01,840
 So no wonder in our lives when doubt presents itself, it's always in the form of a question.

577
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:12,840
 You see, in Christmas or this Christmas narrative, the author of the Bible did not shy away from any stories of doubt

578
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,840
 or try to present to us a perfect humanity.

579
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,840
 Luke actually opened his Jesus story with a story of doubt.

580
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,840
 But at the same time, I believe if we spend some time together to dive into it today,

581
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,840
 we would find the same encouragement that people found in this story.

582
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,840
 Shall we pray?

583
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:39,840
 Father, we are here to open your Word today because we know there is power in your Word.

584
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,840
 We just simply pray that God, we're here, we open our ears.

585
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,840
 Please speak to us, Lord.

586
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,840
 In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

587
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,840
 We're going to look at Luke chapter 1. I'm starting with verse 5.

588
00:41:53,840 --> 00:42:00,840
 "In the time of Herod king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah.

589
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,840
 His wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.

590
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:09,840
 Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commands and decrees blamelessly.

591
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:17,840
 But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old."

592
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,840
 At the beginning of the Gospel of Luke, we were introduced to this priest whose name is Zechariah.

593
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,840
 It's not only that he is a priest, his wife is also a daughter of a priest.

594
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,840
 The priesthood of Israel, it was established back in the days during the Exodus

595
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:38,840
 when Moses, you know, were establishing the tabernacle, which later became the temple.

596
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,840
 Moses also appointed the priesthood.

597
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,840
 The first high priest was Moses' brother, Aaron.

598
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,840
 So you see, like, Elizabeth, she's a descendant of Aaron, the high priest.

599
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:56,840
 And so temple and priesthood, this is a system of worship for the Israelites.

600
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,840
 This is how they worship God, worship Yahweh.

601
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,840
 And priests are the ones who exclusively work inside a temple.

602
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,840
 You gotta know this, you cannot apply to be a priest.

603
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,840
 You cannot say, "I want to be a priest, let me write an email, send in my CV.

604
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,840
 Hey, I want to be a priest." It doesn't work like that.

605
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,840
 You are either born to be a priest, or you are not.

606
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:25,840
 Out of the 12 tribes of Israel, only the Levites, they were chosen to be priests.

607
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
 They were born into it.

608
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:36,840
 So here we see that Zechariah and Elizabeth, they were born in a very noble and prestige background.

609
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:43,840
 Being a priest in Israel means you are part of this leadership together with the king and the prophets.

610
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,840
 They're born to be in the leadership class of Israel.

611
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,840
 And not only that, the Bible also said they're not just noble or honorable in their social status,

612
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,840
 they had amazing character as well.

613
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,840
 Luke said they are blameless.

614
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,840
 So if you were a first century reader of the Bible, you would understand this.

615
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:08,840
 You would understand this perfect couple to be super respected, highly respected in the Jewish society.

616
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,840
 But, there's always a but to the story, right?

617
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:19,840
 But, they were childless, and they were very old.

618
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:25,840
 In the Jewish context, childbearing, it's always regarded as a blessing from God.

619
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:31,840
 Not only that, when a couple was not able to conceive, not able to have children,

620
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,840
 it could lead to social scrutiny, whispers, and even shame.

621
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:42,840
 Childlessness was sometimes viewed as a sign of God's disfavor or punishment.

622
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:51,840
 Could you imagine the emotional pain and social challenges that this couple would have faced throughout their entire life?

623
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,840
 They did their best to follow God, do everything God has asked,

624
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,840
 yet they were caught in a situation that suggested God's favor was not on them.

625
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,840
 Or even worse, that they were punished by God.

626
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:09,840
 For sure, they would have been praying for a child or for a son for many, many years,

627
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,840
 but that prayer was never answered.

628
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,840
 Now, Zechariah's life, in his life, he has only one job.

629
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,840
 As a priest, he's there to pray on behalf of the Israelites.

630
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,840
 Yet, he has been living all these years with the biggest unanswered prayer in his life.

631
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,840
 Could you imagine with me for a moment, if you were a fellow Jew,

632
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:36,840
 would you want this guy to pray on your behalf that his own prayer wasn't even answered?

633
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:44,840
 Or, on the flip side, if you were Zechariah, would you still think you're qualified for your job?

634
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,840
 Let's continue to read from verse 8.

635
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,840
 Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as a priest before God,

636
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,840
 he was chosen by Lot according to the custom of the priesthood,

637
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,840
 to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.

638
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:08,840
 And when the time of the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshippers were praying outside.

639
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,840
 Here, Luke suddenly brought us to a time where Zechariah was at work.

640
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,840
 Give us a glimpse of his work.

641
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,840
 You need to know that in the Jewish priesthood, there were 24 divisions in total.

642
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:25,840
 And besides major festivals where they're all needed because we need all hands on deck during the major festivals,

643
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,840
 but during other time of the year, they only have to serve two times.

644
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,840
 Each time is just a week.

645
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,840
 That's the best news for pastors, right?

646
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,840
 If you get a whole year of salary, but you only have to work two times a year, two weeks a year,

647
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,840
 or maybe Easter and Christmas.

648
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,840
 Hallelujah, right?

649
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,840
 No, we don't think like that.

650
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,840
 We're very diligent, right, Tim?

651
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,840
 We're very diligent.

652
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,840
 So, they only have to work two times a year.

653
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:56,840
 And because there were so many priests in the entire Israel, it's the entire tribe of the nation,

654
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:06,840
 that's why every single priest, they only get to go into the temple to burn incense once in their entire lifetime.

655
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,840
 They only get one chance.

656
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,840
 And Luke was telling us, this is Zechariah's moment.

657
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,840
 This is at the peak of his career.

658
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,840
 This is the moment where he's going to do what he was chosen to do in the first place.

659
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:26,840
 This is as close to Yahweh, the God of Israel, or the creator of universe, as close as he could be.

660
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,840
 I was born for this moment.

661
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,840
 So, old Zechariah went into the holy place of the temple.

662
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,840
 And it says there, verse 11,

663
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,840
 "Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.

664
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,840
 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped by fear.

665
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:49,840
 But the angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid, Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard.

666
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,840
 Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.

667
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,840
 He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth.

668
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,840
 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord.

669
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,840
 He is never to take wine or other fermented drink,

670
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,840
 and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born."

671
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,840
 Wow.

672
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,840
 "He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.

673
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,840
 And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah

674
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,840
 to turn the hearts of the parents to their children

675
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,840
 and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous,

676
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,840
 to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."

677
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,840
 Wow.

678
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,840
 Could there be an even more perfect ending to this?

679
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,840
 Like, your prayer has been heard.

680
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:41,840
 If having a son or a child was something Zechariah and Elizabeth

681
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,840
 has been praying every day for their entire life,

682
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,840
 they could probably have been praying for that for about like 30, 40, 50 years.

683
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,840
 Let's just say it's 40, right?

684
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,840
 If they pray every day, 365 times a year,

685
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,840
 and they've been praying that for 40 years,

686
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,840
 that would roughly equal to about 15,000 times.

687
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:06,840
 I wonder if anyone here who has prayed one prayer for 15,000 times in your life?

688
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,840
 Right? Oh, okay.

689
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,840
 So that's a lot, right?

690
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:16,840
 And I wonder, you know, how their prayer life would look like.

691
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,840
 This is how I imagine.

692
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,840
 Maybe when they were first married, they would say things like this,

693
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,840
 "Dear God, thank you for giving us each other.

694
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,840
 Now we're happily married.

695
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,840
 We're ready to start a family.

696
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,840
 We pray that you will give us a beautiful gift of a child.

697
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,840
 Amen."

698
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,840
 Nothing happened.

699
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,840
 All right. You know, sometimes God has his own timetable, his own timeline.

700
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,840
 Then it became, "Dear God, we respect your timetable.

701
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,840
 We trust in you.

702
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,840
 We pray that you will give us a child when you see fit.

703
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,840
 Amen."

704
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,840
 Still nothing after years.

705
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,840
 Maybe after a while it will become like this.

706
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,840
 "God, I'm not sure if you've heard our prayers.

707
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,840
 I didn't know if you get the message previously.

708
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,840
 You know, if there's something you're not happy with us, you can tell us.

709
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,840
 Like if there's something, if in my job as a priest I made any mistakes,

710
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,840
 please review to me so I can do a better job, I can be a better man.

711
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,840
 Or if there's anything we as a couple, we sinned against you,

712
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,840
 please review to us so that we can set a record straight

713
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,840
 so that we could finally have the blessing in our life.

714
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,840
 Because everyone is telling us if we don't have a child, it must be our sin.

715
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,840
 It must be our own mistakes.

716
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,840
 So God, please review to us what have we done wrong.

717
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,840
 Amen."

718
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:50,840
 Perhaps after years, after years, years,

719
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,840
 finally one day they pray this.

720
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,840
 "It's okay God, it doesn't matter anymore.

721
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,840
 I cannot bear that pain.

722
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,840
 I cannot bear looking at that empty room in my house

723
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,840
 that I've prepared for a baby anymore.

724
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,840
 I can't do it, I can't take it.

725
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,840
 God, why don't, yeah,

726
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,840
 why don't we just pretend we never had this conversation before.

727
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,840
 I'm ready to let go, I'm ready to move on.

728
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,840
 I'm so old, my wife is so old, there's no more chance for us.

729
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,840
 Let's just forget it about God.

730
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,840
 Forget it God.

731
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,840
 I'll still worship you, I'll still work for you, I'll still do what you ask.

732
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,840
 But just let's forget about this."

733
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,840
 I don't know how long it has been.

734
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,840
 I don't know how many times they have prayed this prayer.

735
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,840
 Probably he don't remember praying this or how he felt when he prayed that anymore.

736
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,840
 But at the climax of his career,

737
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,840
 Zechariah was met by a heavenly being showing up and saying these words,

738
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:01,840
 "Your prayer has been heard."

739
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,840
 My prayer has been heard?

740
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:09,840
 You know, I've been praying this prayer for no less than 15,000 times for years.

741
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,840
 My fellow priests, my community, my neighbors, my relatives,

742
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,840
 they all told me that God must have already heard my prayer.

743
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,840
 He's merciful, he's faithful, he would do something.

744
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,840
 And look what I've got here right now.

745
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,840
 Nothing.

746
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
 Nothing.

747
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,840
 What do you expect from me?

748
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,840
 Now you're telling me that's going to be a child?

749
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,840
 You know, when I was young, I was so certain.

750
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,840
 I was so convinced that God has heard my prayer and would answer it.

751
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,840
 Now, I'm not sure anymore.

752
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,840
 I'm not certain anymore.

753
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,840
 I'm not expecting anything else from God anymore.

754
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,840
 And you're telling me that there's a chance that God has listened to my prayer

755
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,840
 and he's answering me right now?

756
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,840
 How can I be sure of this?

757
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,840
 How would I know?

758
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,840
 How can I be certain?

759
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,840
 No doubt.

760
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,840
 This is a story of doubt.

761
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,840
 Here we have old Zechariah.

762
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,840
 He's an old priest, a lifetime servant of God,

763
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,840
 who for years walked a righteous and blameless life,

764
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,840
 yet he still struggled with doubt like you and me and anybody else.

765
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:29,840
 So today, if you have any doubt about God, you're not alone in this room.

766
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,840
 And you have to see that the story of Gabriel's visit to Zechariah

767
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,840
 was immediately followed by his visit to Mary.

768
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,840
 So let me paraphrase the story.

769
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,840
 Unlike Zechariah and Elizabeth, who were very old,

770
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,840
 Mary was just engaged and not married yet.

771
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,840
 In other words, she's very likely to be just a teenager.

772
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,840
 And Gabriel appeared in very similar ways,

773
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,840
 said something very similar that he told Mary how she would bear a child,

774
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,840
 but this child will be the son of the Most High.

775
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,840
 He will be the savior of the world, and his kingdom will never end.

776
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,840
 If you're married, like, "Son, I'm not even married yet."

777
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,840
 That's what she said.

778
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,840
 "But I've not been married yet. How could this happen?

779
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,840
 How will this be?"

780
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,840
 You know, Luke put these two stories side by side,

781
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,840
 and he showed us two people,

782
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,840
 one old priest Zechariah and a young virgin Mary, a teenager,

783
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,840
 who both have their reasonable doubts about what God has just told them,

784
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:36,840
 but Luke recorded their two responses in form of two questions.

785
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,840
 Zechariah, in his doubt, he asked, "How can I be sure of this?

786
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,840
 How can I be certain?"

787
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,840
 In other words, he was looking for certainty.

788
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,840
 Gabriel responded by pointing out that, "You did not believe my words,"

789
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,840
 which were indeed the very word of God.

790
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:00,840
 So Gabriel was saying that, you know, he pointed out Zechariah's unbelief.

791
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,840
 So this morning, we're juggling a few different concepts here

792
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,840
 and allow me to explain how they're all connected to each other.

793
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,840
 First, we talk about the idea of doubt,

794
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,840
 which I mentioned doubt is the feeling within us

795
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,840
 when we're uncertain about something or when we lack conviction.

796
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,840
 It's not uncommon when doubt arises within the context of faith, right?

797
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,840
 Sometimes we wonder if God really loves us,

798
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
 if he listens to us, listens to our prayers,

799
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,840
 or simply wonder if God is even real.

800
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,840
 Are we delusional to believe that there is a being called God in this world?

801
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,840
 As Christians or as human beings,

802
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,840
 we will experience doubt throughout our lifespan,

803
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,840
 not just in faith, but in many areas of our life,

804
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,840
 like self-doubt I just mentioned earlier.

805
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,840
 That's about doubt.

806
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,840
 Then we have this idea, this concept called unbelief.

807
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,840
 What is it?

808
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,840
 Unbelief is the decision to live your life as if there is no God.

809
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,840
 And it is totally possible, let me say this,

810
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,840
 it's totally possible for us to be Christian

811
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,840
 and to be unbelieving at the same time.

812
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,840
 Seriously? How?

813
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,840
 We can come to church gatherings every week

814
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,840
 and sing songs and pray to God,

815
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,840
 yet we don't believe he has ultimate authority

816
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:25,840
 and he works in each and every area in our lives.

817
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,840
 Yes, I believe in God, but I have my own plans for my career.

818
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,840
 I pray to God for my problems many times.

819
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,840
 It just doesn't go away.

820
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,840
 I don't know why I'm speaking in Singaporean accent,

821
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,840
 but it just doesn't go away.

822
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,840
 I guess God, you know, he's not interested or he's too busy.

823
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,840
 I'll just have to handle this myself.

824
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,840
 Sorry for the accent, I don't know where it comes from.

825
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,840
 Whenever, you see, whenever there's an area in your life,

826
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,840
 we decided to ask God to stay out of it and say,

827
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,840
 you know, God, I'll handle it myself.

828
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,840
 That's the exact area where we harbor unbelief in our lives.

829
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,840
 And now it's important to know this.

830
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:09,840
 Doubt is not unbelief, but it can become unbelief.

831
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,840
 Let me say this again.

832
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,840
 Doubt is not unbelief, but doubt can become unbelief.

833
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,840
 I'm going to read from a professor of theology in the UK.

834
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,840
 His name is Alistair McGrath.

835
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,840
 He wrote this.

836
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,840
 When does doubt become unbelief?

837
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,840
 Answer, when you let it.

838
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,840
 When you cling to unrealistic ideas about faith,

839
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:32,840
 when you, if you believe that you can or need to know everything

840
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:37,840
 with absolute certainty, your faith will be in difficulties very soon.

841
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,840
 But faith isn't like that.

842
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,840
 Faith is about being willing to live, trusting in the existence

843
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,840
 and promises of God, knowing that one day that existence

844
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,840
 and those promises will be totally vindicated.

845
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:55,840
 But for the moment, we walk by faith and not by sight.

846
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,840
 In other words, when Zechariah was in his doubt,

847
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,840
 whether God really had heard my prayer,

848
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,840
 whether God would really give me a son,

849
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,840
 when he let that doubt pushes him to demand for certainty,

850
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,840
 to say, how can I be sure of this?

851
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,840
 How would I be certain of this?

852
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,840
 When he demanded certainty from God, that's the moment

853
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,840
 that unbelief start to grow in his heart.

854
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,840
 It's common as humans.

855
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,840
 You want to ask God for signs.

856
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,840
 God, please give me a sign if you want me to do this or that.

857
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,840
 But the moment we see the sign,

858
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:30,840
 it's the moment it no longer requires faith inside of us.

859
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,840
 You see, we run alpha here.

860
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,840
 We just finished one, and I love running alphas.

861
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,840
 And one of my favorite session is actually the session

862
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,840
 that talks about prayer.

863
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,840
 We'll tell people, what is prayer?

864
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,840
 Why do we pray?

865
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,840
 How do we pray?

866
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,840
 And then towards the end, we have small group discussion,

867
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,840
 and then towards the very, very end,

868
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,840
 we're supposed to introduce prayer to the entire group

869
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,840
 for the very first time.

870
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,840
 And for some people, some of our guests

871
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,840
 who are not Christians yet,

872
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,840
 that could be the very first time in their life to pray.

873
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,840
 You see, being a pastor for so many years,

874
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,840
 I'm an expert--okay, there's a confraction.

875
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,840
 I'm an expert to pray prayers that don't require faith.

876
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,840
 I'm very--it's my expertise to pray prayers

877
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,840
 that just in my very words, I'm already comforting that person.

878
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:21,840
 "Oh, yeah, God, you know, Tim is not feeling well this week.

879
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,840
 But yeah, God, I know, you know, if we take enough rest,

880
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,840
 if we give ourselves time to heal,

881
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,840
 and we will eventually be better.

882
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,840
 So, God, I just pray that you give the time and space

883
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:35,840
 for Tim to heal in Jesus' name, amen."

884
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,840
 It's a prayer that is very pastoral.

885
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,840
 It's very comforting.

886
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:44,840
 But honestly, I'm very honest, sometimes if I don't have faith,

887
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,840
 I pray that kind of prayer, it will not fail.

888
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,840
 I'm just praying God give him space and time to heal,

889
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,840
 not even asking God to heal him.

890
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
 But in Alpha, in the first session,

891
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,840
 when I talk about prayer, this is my personal challenge.

892
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,840
 When the first time I ran, I led a small group,

893
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,840
 it came to that moment, somebody said,

894
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,840
 "I just recently lost my job. Can you pray for me?"

895
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,840
 I said, "Sure, let's just pray that God will give you a job."

896
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,840
 (gasps) I don't know if God would do that.

897
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,840
 I don't know, I can't promise, I can't guarantee that.

898
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,840
 But that's the moment when I prayed that prayer,

899
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,840
 "God, please give him a job in Jesus' name, amen."

900
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,840
 That's a kind of prayer that requires faith.

901
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:28,840
 In my uncertainty of whether God will act or not upon my prayer,

902
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:34,840
 that's where faith is activated.

903
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,840
 That's why another Christian author, Philip Yancey,

904
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,840
 he puts it this way.

905
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:44,840
 He said, "The opposite of faith is not doubt, but certainty."

906
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,840
 Let me say that again.

907
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,840
 The opposite of faith is certainty.

908
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:54,840
 Where there is certainty, there is no room for faith.

909
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,840
 And here Luke showed us there is another way to respond in doubt.

910
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,840
 When young Mary received a bizarre word from the angel,

911
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:06,840
 she also had her doubts, but she didn't reject God's word

912
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,840
 in her inability to understand,

913
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,840
 nor did she demand certainty in her confusion.

914
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,840
 She asked, "How will this be?

915
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,840
 How are you going to do this, God?"

916
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,840
 It was a question to explore the will of God in her life.

917
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,840
 And as she began to understand a little bit more what God wants to do,

918
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,840
 and maybe perhaps how God would even do it in her life,

919
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,840
 there is faith arising in her heart, and she said this,

920
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:40,840
 "I am the Lord's servant. May your word to me be fulfilled."

921
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,840
 Luke is showing us there is another way out to doubt.

922
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,840
 There's another way out called faith.

923
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,840
 Faith is not found where certainty could be found.

924
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,840
 It's a risk.

925
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:01,840
 But then Luke also told us a very good news to all us doubters in this world.

926
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,840
 If we don't have that kind of faith, if we're still doubting,

927
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,840
 this is a very comforting moment.

928
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,840
 You see, God does not reject doubters.

929
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,840
 Instead, He draws near to them.

930
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,840
 People, if you look at the Bible, people like Abraham, Moses, Peter, Job,

931
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,840
 they all have their doubts about God or His word.

932
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,840
 If you read the psalm, you will see it is filled with prayers of doubt.

933
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,840
 But God does not push doubters away.

934
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,840
 He allows us to bring those questions to Him,

935
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:36,840
 and He doesn't want us simply to draw our own conclusion based on our experience

936
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,840
 and say, you know, God is not going to help me, He's not going to do anything.

937
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,840
 He doesn't want us to draw that conclusion ourselves.

938
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,840
 He doesn't want our hearts.

939
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,840
 He doesn't want us to let unbelief to grow inside of our hearts.

940
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:51,840
 But you need to see this even when there was a moment of doubt in Zechariah's life,

941
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:57,840
 his doubt didn't and never disqualified him from the blessing of God.

942
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,840
 Even later, God gave him a sign to silence him, that he couldn't talk.

943
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,840
 It was a sign for him to remember.

944
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,840
 You know, when he finally sees his wife being pregnant,

945
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,840
 and he wanted to say something, he couldn't say it.

946
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:15,840
 There he is reminded, no word from God's mouth will ever fail.

947
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,840
 [Gasps]

948
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,840
 No words from God's mouth will ever fail.

949
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,840
 That's the exact same words the angel Gabriel told Mary,

950
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,840
 but Zechariah got to experience it for himself.

951
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,840
 And many years later, his son, John the Baptist,

952
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,840
 you know, he's the greatest Old Testament prophet.

953
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:40,840
 He even saw Jesus prepare the way for Jesus' letter, spiritual revival in Israel.

954
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,840
 He baptized Jesus, but later when he was caught and put into prison,

955
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:49,840
 he also had a moment of doubt, the greatest prophet ever.

956
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,840
 In the Old Testament, he has this moment of doubt.

957
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,840
 So he sent his disciples to Jesus to ask this.

958
01:03:54,840 --> 01:04:00,840
 He said, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"

959
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,840
 Jesus didn't give John a definitive answer.

960
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,840
 He didn't offer certainty.

961
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,840
 Instead, Jesus invites John to see what he has done.

962
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,840
 So Jesus replied to the messengers and said,

963
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,840
 "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard.

964
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:21,840
 The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed,

965
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:27,840
 the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor."

966
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,840
 So Jesus is inviting John to see what he has done and said,

967
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:37,840
 "You know what? If you put your eyes on what I've been doing in this world,

968
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,840
 if you put your eyes on me and not just on the things you're worried about,

969
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:46,840
 that you doubt with, that you will have faith arise inside of your soul one more time."

970
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:52,840
 And today God also invites us to put our trust in him by opening our eyes and ears

971
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,840
 to see, to hear what he has done for us on the cross

972
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,840
 and also what he has been doing around us in our world

973
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:07,840
 so that faith could once again arise in us when we're struggling with doubt.

974
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:14,840
 When I was 23, I was close to giving up.

975
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:23,840
 I was this close to choose unbelief, to write off the idea that God has a calling in my life.

976
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,840
 But I remember the Jesus who showed me his nail-piece hands.

977
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:32,840
 I remember how his love was flowing through my very veins in my body.

978
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,840
 And out of nowhere, that courage or whatever it is,

979
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,840
 I was just telling myself, "Maybe, or maybe this voice is telling me,

980
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,840
 maybe I can give God one more chance."

981
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,840
 Or, "I can ask God to give me one more chance. I don't exactly know how it works.

982
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:52,840
 I only know that I'm so broken. I'm done. I'm undone. There's nothing left in me.

983
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,840
 I couldn't be the one God has chosen. I'm a very broken individual here.

984
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:02,840
 But if God can still do something with my life, here I am, God.

985
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:07,840
 My life is in your hands."

986
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,840
 And so many years later, here standing in front of you all,

987
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:15,840
 it's a guy dropped out of school two times,

988
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:21,840
 got no certificate, no degree, no qualification whatsoever.

989
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,840
 But God so graciously, he brought me through a journey where now,

990
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:29,840
 after almost 20 years, I'm standing here doing the exact same thing

991
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,840
 that when I was 16, God has called me to do.

992
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:38,840
 I get to join a ministry called Alpha, and we film some cool videos

993
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,840
 to tell people about Jesus and about what he has done for us.

994
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,840
 I get to join a beautiful community called The Vine,

995
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:49,840
 where the senior pastor told me, "Chapman, I see that you have struggled with God.

996
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:55,840
 I see that you've wrestled with Him. You're walking like this right now,

997
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,840
 and we want people like you in The Vine.

998
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,840
 We want you to join a community to walk alongside us,

999
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:08,840
 and even come and work here.

1000
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:14,840
 Today, if you find yourself in a position struggling with doubt,

1001
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:19,840
 I want to tell you that you have a place in this community.

1002
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:26,840
 I found my place years ago when I was just a kid, dropped out from school.

1003
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:31,840
 I don't know what to do with my life, but I got accepted in a community like this.

1004
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:35,840
 I got to meet the grace and the love of God once again,

1005
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,840
 and he picked me up here.

1006
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,840
 And I believe he's going to do this.

1007
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,840
 I believe with all my heart he's going to do this for every single one of us

1008
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,840
 who need him to do that again.

1009
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:54,840
 And I just remember that, you know, if we're struggling with doubts about God in our life,

1010
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,840
 he's not angry with us. He's not rejecting us.

1011
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:04,840
 In fact, he is calling us once again onto a journey of faith.

1012
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,840
 He accepts all the complaints, all the questions that we're throwing at him,

1013
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,840
 but he said, "I'm going to show you what I'm doing in your life,

1014
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,840
 or maybe in someone else's life around you,

1015
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,840
 and I want to invite you once again to put your trust in me.

1016
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:25,840
 I want to invite you onto a journey of faith where you have to walk by faith and not by sight."

1017
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:32,840
 And so I'm wondering if anybody here, right now the Holy Spirit is whispering into your ears.

1018
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,840
 Perhaps there were moments in your life you decided, "Okay, God, I'm done.

1019
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,840
 I've prayed enough times. I'm not going to talk to you about this anymore."

1020
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:44,840
 There is an area of unbelief in your life, or maybe right here, right now,

1021
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,840
 where you are, you're struggling with this doubt.

1022
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,840
 You're asking, "God, I'm not sure if you've heard my prayer.

1023
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:54,840
 God, I'm not sure if you still love me. God, I'm not sure if I'm still worthy."

1024
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,840
 I believe this is the moment God wants to speak to us today.

1025
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,840
 That's why we're going to enter into a moment of prayer,

1026
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,840
 and I'm going to invite the worship team back,

1027
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,840
 and we're just going to spend some time in the presence of the Holy Spirit today,

1028
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,840
 and we're just going to ask Him to come.

1029
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,840
 Can I invite everyone to stand where you are?

1030
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:31,840
 As we worship, as we pray, I want to invite you back to that moment,

1031
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:38,840
 or back to that place where unbelief is harboring in your life right now,

1032
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,840
 where perhaps years ago, weeks ago, days ago, you told God,

1033
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,840
 "Okay, God, we'll never talk about this again.

1034
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,840
 You don't have to be in this area of my life."

1035
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,840
 In the very gentle invitation that the Holy Spirit is extending right now,

1036
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,840
 I invite each and every one of us to go back to that place,

1037
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,840
 and open up that area to God once again.

1038
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,840
 God is not going to offer you certainty,

1039
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,840
 but He's going to invite you into a journey of faith, if you will.

1040
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,840
 Come, Holy Spirit.

1041
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,840
 Bring that to Him.

1042
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,840
 Maybe you're reminded of all the shame,

1043
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,840
 maybe you're reminded of all the suffering, all the pain,

1044
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,840
 but God wants to be with you today.

1045
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,840
 He's not rejecting you.

1046
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,840
 He's not rejecting you when you doubt,

1047
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,840
 when you have an area of unbelief in your life.

1048
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,840
 Indeed, that's why we have Christmas.

1049
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,840
 He came for us.

1050
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,840
 He came for us doubters,

1051
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,840
 and He is here with us right here, right now.

1052
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:51,840
 So this is a moment between ourselves and God.

1053
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,840
 If the Holy Spirit is gently talking to you, speaking to you,

1054
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,840
 about that event, that area, that thing in your life

1055
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,840
 that you already put in a box, shelve it,

1056
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,840
 never talk about it, never think about it again,

1057
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,840
 if the Holy Spirit is gently telling you,

1058
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,840
 "Hey, what about that?

1059
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,840
 "Would you let me into that space in your life once again?

1060
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,840
 "Would you allow me to speak faith into you today once again?"

1061
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,840
 If that's you, I invite you.

1062
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,840
 Let's just pray and worship God and say,

1063
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,840
 "God, I built my life upon you.

1064
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,840
 "There's nothing in my life that I would not open up to you.

1065
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,840
 "Come, Holy Spirit, restore me.

1066
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,840
 "Give me faith once again.

1067
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,840
 "I believe.

1068
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,840
 "Help my unbelief, God."

 you are faithful.

01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,840
 You are faithful to your people.

1152
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:20,840
 And you come through, you never fail us.

1153
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:25,840
 Lord, I thank you that we can bring our doubts,

1154
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,840
 our struggles, where we do wonder,

1155
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,840
 you know, what is going on?

1156
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,840
 What are you doing?

1157
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,840
 That we can bring them to you.

1158
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,840
 Lord, you know, every single person here,

1159
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,840
 you know the doubts, the struggles,

1160
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,840
 the pain that they're carrying.

1161
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,840
 Maybe the things that came up as Chapman was preaching.

1162
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,840
 And Lord, we hand them to you.

1163
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,840
 We pray that you will release faith, trust,

1164
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,840
 hope on your people right now.

1165
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,840
 Holy Spirit, we pray for this work.

1166
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,840
 We pray that you pour that right now on over your people.

1167
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,840
 Lord, I also pray for us that we are a community

1168
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,840
 that walks with each other,

1169
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,840
 that cares for each other,

1170
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,840
 that carries each other's burdens.

1171
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:12,840
 That we're not alone in these challenges that we're facing,

1172
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,840
 but that you place people on our sides.

1173
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,840
 And so we give you all the glory.

1174
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,840
 We say thank you that when we place our faith in you,

1175
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,840
 we are never put to shame.

1176
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,840
 We are never put to shame when we trust in you, Lord.

1177
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,840
 And we lift all these things up to you

1178
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,840
 and pray this in your wonderful name, Jesus.

1179
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:34,840
 Amen.

01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,840
 Right now we do have a prayer team that's standing here

1188
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,840
 on your right-hand side with the orange tags.

1189
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,840
 If you would love somebody to pray with you,

1190
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,840
 you know, for whatever is going on,

1191
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,840
 something to rejoice over,

1192
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,840
 something where you need God to act,

1193
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,840
 they would love to pray with you.

1194
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,840
 So please do take advantage of that.

1195
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:18,840
 Also, just a reminder for those joining the barbecue,

1196
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,840
 and if you signed up, do make your way to the bus

1197
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,840
 by Thai Fat Thai restaurant, the green restaurant.

1198
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,840
 You walk out, you turn to the right.

1199
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,840
 It's about 50 meters there.

1200
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,840
 And then parents, yeah, do -- right now is also time

1201
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,840
 to pick up your children.

1202
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,840
 Thank you so much for coming.

1203
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:37,840
 We love you.

1204
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,840
 Have a wonderful week, and we see you next week.
