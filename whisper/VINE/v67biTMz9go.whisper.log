[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   "And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   The Lord shall return for my soul."
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.640]   Those lyrics that we just heard in that beautiful hymn
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.480]   that was originally written by Horatio Spafford
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.400]   and first published in 1876,
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.800]   carries with it so much of the central themes
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.680]   of this season of Advent
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.560]   that we're now celebrating here in 2024
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.240]   and that we began last week.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.800]   This idea that when the Lord returns,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.200]   our faith shall be sight.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.280]   As we began our Advent series last week,
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.640]   I explained to us that historically,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.640]   Advent is actually the celebration of two distinct events.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.880]   It's the celebration of the first Advent,
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.440]   the first arrival of Jesus as a child on Christmas day.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.240]   But Advent is also the celebration of the longing
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.200]   that we have for the return of Christ,
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.880]   to come back, not just to be born as a child,
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.280]   but to return at the end of all things
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.160]   as a conquering king
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.040]   and living on behalf of both of those realities today.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.560]   That's what Advent is.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.240]   It's the great privilege and challenge that we have
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.320]   to live between what would be called
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.240]   the two bookends of redemptive history,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.120]   of Jesus's story, both his birth and his return.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.280]   We sit between those times
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.400]   and we have the great privilege
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.280]   and the glory of living the world
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.800]   and showing the world
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.600]   how these two events shape everything.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.320]   Scholars call this time of living between the birth
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.320]   and the return of Jesus the now but not yet time.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.240]   Now, in the sense that Christ has come at Christmas
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.600]   in that first original Advent,
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.800]   that he did inaugurate the kingdom,
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.840]   that he did go to the cross
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.680]   and paid the price for our sins,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.600]   that he did rise from there three days later,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.120]   that he did gather his disciples around him
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.240]   and give them the mission
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.520]   for commissioning the world into discipleship,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.560]   that he did ascend to heaven
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   and send his spirit to help us in our time here.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.440]   All of that is now, that has happened,
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   yet we're also living with this sense of not yet,
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.080]   that the reality is that sin is still an issue for us.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.960]   Its victory has come completely on the cross
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.440]   and yet we still struggle with the influence
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.240]   and the impact of sin on our lives.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.080]   We still see the impact of sin in the world
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.120]   and so the New Testament holds this tension
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.600]   between the reality that Christ has come
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.200]   and yet the need for him to return and return soon
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.400]   because when he comes back,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.840]   as John sees this vision on the island of Patmos
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.600]   and God pulls the curtain back at the end of all things
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.640]   and goes in Revelation 21, 22,
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.080]   this is how it's all going to end.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.680]   As we see that, we long for it
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.720]   because then the world will be completely as it should be.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.320]   Now though, we're in the in-between
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.400]   and the New Testament is filled with passages
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.840]   about that in-between time.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.000]   And last week, we took a look at Paul's famous passage
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.960]   in 1 Corinthians 13, not the love section,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.200]   but the bit right after it
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.880]   where he basically says to his church,
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.400]   look, when we're living in this in-between time,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.680]   we're living in a time where imperfection
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.120]   is the reality for us,
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.560]   but there is a time coming when perfection will return.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.840]   And Paul says, it's like we don't know everything right now.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.960]   In this now but not yet time, there are gaps
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   in our knowledge, gaps in our experience.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.320]   And we human beings, we don't like the gaps.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.040]   When we have questions that go unanswered in our lives,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.800]   when we have uncertainties that we sit in,
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.480]   human beings, we don't like that.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.960]   And we wanna try and solve all of the mysteries.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.880]   We wanna try and get all the answers.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.160]   We really don't like being in the gaps.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.720]   But Paul writes to the church and he says,
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.080]   you've gotta understand in this now but not yet time
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.920]   between the bookends of the birth and the return,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.280]   there will be some gaps.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.840]   There's a time coming where there will be no gaps.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.280]   When perfection returns and we'll see everything
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.640]   and our faith as that lyric said, shall be made sight.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.240]   But right now we sit in the in-between
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.200]   and there's a longing inside of us.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.640]   That when we find ourselves in the gaps of life,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.360]   we can have two choices.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.840]   Either we are overwhelmed and succumbed by the gaps
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.800]   and they drain life from us,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.440]   or perhaps the gaps are the great catalyst
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.400]   to our deepening relationship and trust
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.720]   in the one who has no gaps.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.920]   And Paul says, here's the beautiful thing.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.800]   That although we are in this now but not yet time
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.440]   and there's tension and there's gaps,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.880]   God has not left us alone in the gaps.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.880]   And he says right at the end of chapter 13,
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.080]   in one Corinthians, he says this.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.320]   He says, now three things remain for us.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.280]   Faith, hope, and love.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.680]   And it's like Paul is saying,
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.320]   God has given us these vehicles,
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.840]   these catalysts within the gaps of this now but not yet time
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.360]   to help us to reconnect with him,
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.000]   to develop a deeper trust and hope in him
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.080]   that we would see the endable things
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.720]   and desire for it to come,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.440]   that we would cry that prayer
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.920]   at the end of the New Testament,
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.160]   Maranatha, come Lord Jesus.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.600]   'Cause we wanna see the world
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.160]   just as you have always created it to be.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.600]   And so in our Advent series here at the Biome,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.200]   we're taking faith, hope, and love this week
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.040]   and the next two.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.880]   We're gonna unpack those for us.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.600]   And today we're starting with the topic of faith.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.520]   Now for me to try to cover the idea of faith
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.320]   in one message is too impossible.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.600]   So what I wanna do is speak about faith with you today
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.560]   in the way that I think it's most relevant
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.600]   in this now but not yet tension of our Advent season
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.480]   between the birth and the return of Jesus.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.920]   And to understand that,
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.400]   we have to first of all begin to grapple with the reality
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.840]   that the way that we think about faith today
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.680]   in the modern church is totally different
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.960]   to how the first Christians in the first century
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.200]   in the New Testament thought about faith.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.760]   You see, here in the modern church,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.640]   we think about faith like this.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.640]   We essentially boil faith down to belief,
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.440]   to a set of beliefs that we have
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.960]   that creates a faith within us.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.840]   And those beliefs are like doctrinal statements
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.920]   that we stand with and we honor and we agree to,
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.200]   and that means I have the Christian faith.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.640]   I can call myself a Christian if I believe certain things.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.720]   So when we say to somebody, I have faith in Jesus,
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.880]   what we're really saying in the modern context
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.400]   is I believe in the story of Jesus.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.080]   I believe that he inaugurated the kingdom.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.480]   I believe he came at Christmas.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.760]   I believe that he went to the cross
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.960]   and paid the price of my sins.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.480]   I believe he rose after three days.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.240]   I believe that we have the spirit now in us,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.360]   the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.200]   now lives in me.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.120]   I believe all those things.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.360]   And so therefore, I can call myself a Christian
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.280]   and I say I have faith, belief in Jesus.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.960]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.040]   So that's how we think about it
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.320]   and we use that phrase all the time.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.520]   You can go onto the Vine website
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.080]   and we have a statement of faith.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.600]   Well, that basically is a statement of beliefs
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.360]   that we hold to as a church community
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.440]   that we encourage you also to embrace
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.120]   as you fellowship and worship along with us.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.880]   So we use this idea in the modern church of faith
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.040]   being connected primarily to belief,
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.760]   our way of thinking, doctrinal statements that we adhere to,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.720]   but that is not how it was used in the New Testament.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.360]   'Cause you need to put yourself in the sandals,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.080]   if you will, of the first century Christians.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.440]   They're trying to evangelize, bring the gospel
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.600]   to a Greco-Roman culture and world.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.880]   And within the Roman world, there was a pantheon of gods,
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.920]   many, many different kinds of gods.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.040]   And because in the Roman world,
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.520]   there was such a pantheon of gods,
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.160]   if you were a good Roman citizen,
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.320]   you believed in all of these gods.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   Now, just believing in them
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.200]   didn't mean you were worshiping them all.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.960]   In fact, it was impossible for you
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.600]   to worship all of these gods,
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.400]   but you believed in them
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.560]   alongside of your fellow faithful Greek people
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.760]   because that was the understanding and the culture.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.360]   Now, what the first century Christians realized is,
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.640]   if they just said to a Roman person,
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.840]   "Hey, we want you to believe in Jesus,"
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.720]   their response would be, "Sure, happy to believe in Jesus.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.720]   "I can just add Jesus onto the shelf
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.760]   "with all the other gods that I believe in.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.040]   "We can just put Jesus into the pantheon of gods,
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.480]   "and that's all fine.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.520]   "Believing in Jesus doesn't mean
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.160]   "I actually have to worship him."
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.640]   Are you following this?
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.520]   So when the first century church
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.680]   was trying to talk about what it meant to say,
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.480]   Jesus is Lord,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.040]   they needed to find a word
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.000]   that defined for them more than just belief.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.560]   Because if it was just about belief,
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.160]   the Romans would just add Jesus to the pantheon.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.560]   They wanted the Romans to get rid of the pantheon
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.080]   and follow after Jesus and Jesus alone.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.920]   They knew that Jesus was the only God,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.320]   that he was the only God to worship.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.840]   And then when you brought Jesus into your life,
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.360]   it meant a complete radical transformation of self.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.120]   It meant that nothing else mattered after that point.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.600]   It meant that there was no other God
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.560]   that was to be worshiped,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.400]   that Jesus demanded everything that I had,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.120]   that I would have to pick up my cross and follow him.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.200]   I would need to give away all the other pantheon of gods
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.480]   and say, "This is the one true God."
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.320]   So they were like,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.600]   "What word can we use from the Greek culture
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.160]   "that will help them to understand
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.680]   "that we're calling them for a radical change in their life?"
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.720]   So here's what they did.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.520]   They chose the Greek word, "Pistes."
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.560]   And Pistes was used in Greek culture of those days
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.120]   to mean trust,
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.200]   particularly trustworthiness in relational context,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.400]   or actually it carried with it the sense of commitment,
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.200]   committed, loyal, trusting relationship.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.800]   Even when things get hard, I'm committed, I'm trusting,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.520]   I'm in relationship with this thing,
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.840]   and I will carry that on forever.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.360]   So the word Pistes was used in Greek culture
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.680]   to speak of this undying, connected trust
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.560]   to another in relationship with them
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.240]   that everything else has to submit to it.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.360]   And they took that word and they said,
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.680]   "This is what it means to believe in Jesus."
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.040]   It's like you're having this Pistes relationship with him.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.840]   Everything else needs to fall away.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.280]   He's the only one you should trust.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.280]   Now, can you guess
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.040]   in your English language versions of the Bible
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.400]   what English word is used to translate
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.440]   the Greek word Pistes?
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.720]   You guessed it, it's the word faith.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.520]   Now, this is really important that you understand this
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.640]   because when you read the word faith in the New Testament,
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.840]   it's not just talking about some set idea of beliefs,
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.160]   it's actually talking about the complete giving away
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.840]   of your life in fullness and trust
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.760]   to this relationship you have with Jesus.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.800]   So every time the faith comes up
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.000]   in your English language Bible,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.200]   it's actually talking about,
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.000]   are you trusting your whole life in relationship to this
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.840]   or are you putting your trust in other places?
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.640]   It was a call to complete surrender
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.600]   and this was the word that they used
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.640]   as they shared the hope of Jesus in the world.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.760]   Now, here's why it's important that I tell you that.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.880]   Because one of the things I want you to start doing
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.240]   is you read the New Testament
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.480]   and you see the word faith in Jesus or faith pop up,
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   you should begin to translate that
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.120]   as this is calling me to trust the Lord more,
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.600]   not believe certain things.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.440]   Are you with me?
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.920]   It's not a stopping at,
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.440]   I'm just gonna have some intellectual understanding
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.120]   of something, this is actually
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.520]   about the radical transformation of my life.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.600]   Helpful?
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.080]   Okay, now, the New Testament is filled with moments
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.400]   where it speaks of this radical kind of call
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.640]   to trusting in God beyond everything.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.480]   But I wanna take you to perhaps
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.080]   what is the most famous of these,
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.360]   the one that I think actually speaks the most
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.400]   to this now but not yet time of advent
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.360]   that we're in right now.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.160]   And this is found in Hebrews chapter 11,
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.600]   starting in verse one.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.080]   Now, listen to this, this is what the writer says.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:44.080]   He says, "Now, faith is confidence in what we hope for
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.680]   and the assurance about what we do not see.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.400]   This is what the ancients were commended for."
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.680]   So by faith, we understand that the universe
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.680]   was formed at God's command so that it was seen
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.320]   or what was seen was not made out of what was visible.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.280]   By faith, Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.880]   By faith, he was commended as a righteous man
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.360]   when God spoke well of his offerings.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.920]   And by faith, he still speaks even though he is dead.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.720]   By faith, Enoch was taken from this life
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.560]   so that he did not experience death.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.560]   He could not be found because God had taken him away.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.120]   For before he was taken,
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.080]   he was commended as one who pleased God.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.520]   And without faith, it is impossible to please God.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.680]   Ho, ho, ho, I wanna preach on this one from it.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.840]   Are you okay?
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.040]   Notice this again.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.800]   Without faith, it is impossible to please God.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.480]   I don't know about you, I don't know if you've ever
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.800]   taken some time to actually deeply reflect
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   around what the writer in Hebrews here
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.160]   is actually trying to communicate.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.720]   Without faith, it is impossible to please God.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.520]   I don't know about you, but that sort of feels to me
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.360]   a little bit like an unfair obligation on humans.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.400]   I don't know if you've ever tried to please God.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.440]   Have you ever tried to please God?
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.280]   Just me?
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.520]   We all try to please God, don't we, all the time.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.280]   Or maybe for like one day, you're like,
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.720]   if I could only just please God a little bit more,
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.640]   if I can only get God's a little bit more favor on my side,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.880]   more of his blessings, then everything will go well.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.680]   So today, I'm just gonna try to be a nicer person.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.480]   I'm gonna try to be a little bit better.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.600]   I'm gonna try to like get my life in order.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.360]   I'm gonna confess all my sins.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.720]   I'm gonna do all of this stuff to try to get God
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.880]   to be pleased with me so that his grace would be on me more,
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.160]   so that his blessings would be,
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.200]   and we work really hard as human beings sometimes
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.280]   to try to do all of this activity
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.160]   in order for God to be pleased.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.040]   And the writer here says, it is impossible
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.640]   to please God without faith.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.400]   So you can do all of these activities,
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.840]   all of these things that you're thinking
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.440]   is winning God's favor, and none of it is gonna please him
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.960]   if you do it without faith.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.160]   Faith is the changing thing,
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.040]   the thing that changes everything in the conversation.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.520]   The passage here does not say, hey, if you try hard enough,
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.920]   he will be pleased with you.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.920]   It doesn't say here, hey, if you're good enough,
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.640]   he's gonna be pleased with you.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.920]   It doesn't say if you're successful enough,
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.000]   he's gonna be pleased with you.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.360]   It literally says without faith, you cannot please God.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.280]   The only thing that we have that brings pleasure
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.560]   in God's eyes, that grants this great pleasure to him
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.000]   is when we exercise faith.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.880]   Now here's the other interesting thing about this.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.320]   I wonder if you've thought of it this way.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.320]   We are the only species in the whole of God's creation
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.000]   who is called to do this.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.960]   In other words, everything else is not called to do that.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.480]   So for example, a dog is not called to live by faith.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.240]   Possums are not called to live by faith.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.040]   Trees are not called to live by faith.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.880]   The only creation that God has made
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.920]   that is called to live by faith is us, is humans.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.280]   We are the only ones who are held to that kind of standard.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.280]   Now why is that important?
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.920]   Because really, if you follow the logic
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.720]   of what the writer's trying to communicate here,
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.800]   here's what he's saying.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.440]   Faith, which is this exercise of our trust in God,
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.040]   is the one activity we do that makes us truly human.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.320]   It's the one thing we do that actually separates us
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.920]   from the animal kingdom around us,
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.040]   which is really challenging if you flip it the other way
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.240]   and think of it like this.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.920]   If you live without faith, you are just an animal.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.120]   No, no, that's not a joke.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.120]   I'm preaching to you what God is communicating here to us,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.880]   that our exercise of faith is the one thing
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.560]   that actually makes us truly human.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.280]   And if we live without faith,
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.480]   then we are no better than the animal kingdom around us.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.640]   You know, a dog pleases the Lord
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.120]   simply by just being a dog, a possum,
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.440]   just by being a possum, a tree,
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.560]   by the glorious fact that it is just a tree.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.120]   They just have to exist to please God,
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.360]   but us, we have to exercise trust in Him.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.680]   And as we do that, we find ourselves
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.200]   being more the way we were ever created to be.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.880]   We were literally designed and created
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.520]   to honor the Lord with faith, to live a life of faith.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.760]   And when we live without faith,
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.160]   we are actually living far beyond and below
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.520]   the standard of our human potential.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.760]   Faith is this incredible thing
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.000]   that helps us to exercise exactly who it is
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.520]   that we've been made to be.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.040]   It separates us from the rest of God's creation,
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.280]   and it plants our feet firmly in this idea
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.880]   that we are human, which is really interesting.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.640]   Because so often as human beings,
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.320]   when it comes to faith, here's what we think.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.120]   We think faith makes somebody superhuman.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   Oh, Pastor Andrew, he has such great faith.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.320]   Oh, I wish I was like Pastor Andrew.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.480]   Oh, if only I could be a little bit more like Pastor Andrew,
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.080]   I would also have great faith,
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.440]   and I would be a better person,
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.640]   and I would live a better life.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.680]   And we kind of put people up on a pedestal,
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.240]   and we say, these people have super faith,
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.840]   and we wanna try and be like these superhumans
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.000]   who give faith.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.200]   But the writer in Hebrews here
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.320]   is saying the opposite of this.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.640]   He's saying, look, faith doesn't make you superhuman.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.960]   Faith makes you simply human.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.920]   Come on, church.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.560]   It doesn't make you superhuman.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.760]   It doesn't put a cape on your back with a big S on it.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.920]   It just makes you the way you were designed to be,
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.520]   'cause you are not a dog, you are not a possum.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.680]   You are a human being.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.920]   Therefore, please him with faith.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.480]   And if you live without faith, then you're no better
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.400]   than any of these other creative things around you.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.400]   You're not actually being human.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.600]   So it's like the writer here is actually inviting humanity
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.320]   into the glory of being just as God had created them to be.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.160]   And this is important, 'cause he's saying
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.600]   we have to separate ourselves from all other creation,
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.720]   and the way we do that is we please God by giving faith,
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.440]   which means we should ask the question,
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.520]   what does faith look like?
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.320]   How do we do that then?
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.160]   Because I wanna be human.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.240]   I don't know about you, but I do not wanna be a dog.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.960]   I wanna be a human being,
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.720]   and I wanna live for the glory of God,
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.120]   and I want my life to please him.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.480]   And if we cannot please God without faith,
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.360]   then my question is, how do we live with faith?
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.040]   So good that the phone went right at the end of that.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.880]   You hear that?
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.120]   How do we live without faith?
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.040]   (imitates phone ringing)
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.880]   That's God's message to you.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.480]   (imitates phone ringing)
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.160]   Turn your phones off in Jesus' name, I love you.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.000]   All right.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.120]   How do we do this?
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.800]   Well, now that we've unpacked the very end
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.560]   of the passage I read, and we understand this call
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.320]   to be separated from everything around us
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.520]   and be truly human, let's now go back and see how it's done.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.840]   Notice what it says in verse one.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.240]   "Now faith is the confidence in what we hope for."
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.560]   Hang on, okay, let's just stop there.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.440]   Let's just stop there for a moment.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.800]   "Faith is the confidence in what we hope for."
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.160]   I don't know about you, but that is not gonna work for me.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.800]   That is not gonna work for me because I don't know
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.340]   if that is how I'm living my life.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.040]   In fact, I can tell you that's usually not the way
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.880]   I live my life.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.240]   Faith is the confidence in what we hope for.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.360]   Hope seems so out there, doesn't it?
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.200]   It seems so nebulous.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.280]   It doesn't feel rooted in anything.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.400]   It feels like it's some future thing
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.680]   that we can't tangibly grasp.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.740]   No, you wanna know what we find our confidence in?
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.440]   As human beings, it's not some nebulous little hope
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.920]   that's kind of out there somewhere.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.480]   What we find confidence is what we have right here and now.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.240]   We root our confidence in what we have, don't we?
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.320]   So much of our lives is based off the confidence
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.720]   of what we have, not the confidence of what we hope for.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.660]   We actually have more confidence in our bank accounts
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.360]   than we do in the promises of God.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.480]   Oh, you don't want me to preach this.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.560]   I'm gonna preach this one.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.180]   We have more confidence in our bank accounts
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.320]   than we do in taking a risk in Jesus.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.040]   We have more confidence in our workplaces
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.000]   and the job that we do that puts a roof over our head
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.560]   than we do in trusting Him.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.240]   We have more confidence in our own skill sets
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.320]   and what we are and our gifts and our talents
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.080]   than we do in relying on Him
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.960]   and the work of His Spirit in this life.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.280]   And so when the Bible says,
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.000]   "Here's faith, have confidence in what you hope for,"
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.040]   we say, "No."
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.080]   No, I'm rooted and I'm grounded in what I have
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.600]   and what I have gives me confidence.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.900]   Only me that does this.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.320]   Anyone else here do that?
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.420]   We root ourselves, don't we, in what we have
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.740]   and that's where we draw our confidence
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.440]   and the writer here is saying, "You've got it wrong.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.640]   "It's got to be in what you hope for."
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.480]   Why?
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.880]   Because there is such a big difference
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.240]   between what you have and what you hope for.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:20.200]   See, what you have is your possessions.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.880]   What you hope for is your expectations.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.860]   What you have is past and present.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.060]   This is very important.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.700]   What you hope for is future.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.260]   Put it in the language of this series.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.980]   What you have is now, what you hope for is not yet.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.620]   And here's what the writer's saying.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:45.700]   If all you do is live without faith,
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.100]   then you are rooting yourself
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.620]   in the past and the present only.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.140]   Come on, church, follow the logic.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.940]   He's saying, if you live without faith,
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.300]   if faith literally is designed to be this hoping
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.660]   for what we don't currently have
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.140]   and all you do is live without faith,
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.580]   that means you're only living for what you do have.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.420]   That's something that you've received in the past
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.740]   or something you're possessing in the present.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.780]   You're trapped in the past and the present,
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.060]   but human beings were made for the future.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:16.140]   Human beings were not made to just honor
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.500]   and understand the past and the present.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.340]   We were made to move the world
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.020]   with the work of the spirit towards its good future.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.420]   And so the writer here is attacking this sort of idea
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.740]   that, hey, if you're without faith, it's just about now,
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.660]   which we saw last week when Paul writes
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.940]   about the now but not yet.
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.380]   What does he say about the now?
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.140]   He says the now is a hard place to be
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.500]   'cause we've got these big gaps
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.140]   and we don't have all the answers
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.700]   and we don't know everything.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.940]   And it's like looking in a mirror dimly
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.700]   and the now here overwhelms us.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.900]   And when it overwhelms us, we try to control.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.660]   And when we try to control, we make things even worse.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.260]   And this is why he then writes and says,
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.620]   you wanna know what the way to live really is?
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.260]   It's not to live trapped in the past or the present.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.300]   In the now, the way to live as a human being
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.300]   created in the image of God
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.660]   is to put your confidence in what you hope for.
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:09.540]   It's to begin to stretch beyond into the future
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.980]   and believe that that is where the promises of God are
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.820]   and God will bring those promises.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.460]   Oh, I have confidence in what I hope for.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.340]   I'm not tethered here to what is just now.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:27.380]   This is Paul saying, this is why God gives us faith.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.060]   See, if God just wanted you rooted
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.700]   in the past and the present,
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.340]   he wouldn't have given you faith
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.620]   in this now but not yet time.
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.460]   Instead, to help you in those gaps,
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.820]   faith comes to lift you out of the present and the past
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.780]   and bring you towards the hope of his return.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.740]   Oh, haste the day when you return
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.340]   when my faith will become sight.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.740]   That what I believe right now,
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.020]   I will see in its fullness then.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.140]   That's my longing.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.500]   See, this is the great message of Advent.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.060]   The great message of Advent
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:04.260]   is that this idea of peace comes upon us
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.220]   when we're not kind of looking for what we have right now
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.020]   but we're longing for what we hope for in the future.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.620]   And here's the thing, if you do not have confidence
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.580]   in what you hope for in the future,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.700]   you will hold on far too tightly
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.300]   to what you have in the present.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.300]   Come on, church, I'm gonna say that again.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.980]   If you do not have confidence
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.540]   in what you hope for in the future,
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.700]   that will force you to hold on way too tightly
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.780]   to what you have in the past and in the present.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.260]   And all those things that the Holy Spirit
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.060]   actually wants to release from you,
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.740]   all those things that tether you
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.620]   to the pain of your past or the struggles of your present,
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.820]   he wants to release you to that.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.900]   But if your confidence is there and not there,
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.100]   you're gonna be tethered here.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.220]   Are you following what the writer's saying?
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.420]   Now, this is really important
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.660]   because this is an invitation
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.300]   to greater freedom in your life.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.900]   And some of you need to understand this.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.060]   This is so important.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.820]   When you live without faith,
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.340]   you will live tethered to the past and the present.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.020]   And that will shape how you think about life.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:06.900]   And here's the thing,
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.060]   if that is shaping how you think about life,
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.820]   you are living more with fate than faith.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.180]   I wanna unpack this one for you for a moment.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.740]   See, I'm convinced that the majority of Christians
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.220]   actually think they're living faithfully,
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.700]   but they're actually living faithfully.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.300]   You see, the Bible is saying, here's how to live.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.100]   Have greater confidence in what you hope for
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.180]   than what you have.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.260]   But the reality is for all of us, I would say,
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.380]   we actually root ourselves in what we have
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.180]   more than what we hope for.
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.420]   And therefore, we're allowing what has happened already
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.740]   to determine what's gonna happen ahead.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.060]   That's fate.
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.740]   Fate is the predetermined understanding
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.900]   of everything in the world that has happened
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.140]   and that I'm caught up in an unchangeable sequence of events
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.300]   because of what's happened and what is happening.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.460]   That's fate.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.380]   And this is the great challenge to us.
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.420]   As Christians, we might think we're being faithful,
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.020]   but we're actually being faithful.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.260]   We're actually logging ourselves in that
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.820]   than the hope of what is to come.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.940]   And this is the great invitation.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.740]   Lift yourself out from a fate way of thinking
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.580]   to a faith way of thinking.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.020]   To do that, just be confident in what it is
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.660]   that you hope for.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.620]   Question is, you should wrestle with this one this week.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.900]   What is it that you're hoping for?
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.940]   And what is it that you're hoping for
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.660]   that has a confidence in your heart
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:37.380]   that's far greater than what you currently already possess?
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.980]   If you can make that shift,
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.460]   you will move from fate to faith.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.700]   And let me just say this one more time.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.100]   If you are living with fate,
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.180]   you are no better than an animal
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.740]   because that's what animals do.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.940]   That's how they live.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.460]   That's how they function.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.260]   They're fate-based.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.140]   They are doing it out of the response
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.460]   of the past and the present.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.620]   We humans are arranged and designed to live differently.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.580]   And the question is, will we live differently?
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.820]   Are you tracking with this still?
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.580]   Now, notice what happens in the second half of this.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.020]   This blows my mind even more.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.660]   It says this, so now faith is the confidence
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.380]   in what we hope for and the assurance
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.740]   of what is not yet seen.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.460]   This one's also not gonna work for me, by the way.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.780]   The assurance of what we do not yet see,
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.540]   that doesn't make any sense
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.700]   because surely my whole life is kind of based
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.580]   off of what I can see.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.980]   Surely the assurance I have is in how I see things
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.660]   in my life and the things that I can tangibly see around me.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.260]   In fact, humans actually define success
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.940]   based on what they see.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.660]   This, my friends, is why social media exists.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.260]   It's why we have Instagram.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.940]   I'm on Instagram, so just, you know,
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.660]   you can follow me if you want, but anyway.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.060]   But Instagram is essentially me saying,
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.620]   I wanna show you a side of who I am.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.620]   I wanna show you how successful I am.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.060]   I wanna show you the best moments of my life
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.260]   because we judge based on what we currently see, don't we?
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.980]   Like, that's just the natural way that we do this,
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:17.020]   and the writer here says, if you only live a life
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.260]   where you're basing it on what you currently see,
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.500]   then again, you're not actually being human.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.460]   Follow the logic once again
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:29.940]   because our faith, which makes us able to please God
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.060]   in our humanity, is based on the assurance
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.900]   of what we do not yet see.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.540]   So in other words, Christians should go out into the world
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.700]   and they should see the world differently
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:46.700]   from everybody else, but I think we struggle with this.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.420]   I don't think this comes naturally to us,
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.740]   and I think we have to think deeply about this
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.180]   'cause I don't know about you,
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.060]   but if you start looking at the world,
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.460]   it's pretty depressing on the whole.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.620]   I mean, there's a lot of pain out there.
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.420]   There's a lot of brokenness.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.820]   There's a lot of sin.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.260]   There's a lot of betrayal.
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.700]   There's a lot of death and war and violence and suffering.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.060]   And if we were to look at the world
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.700]   purely at what we currently see,
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.220]   I think we would be the most depressed people
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.460]   that we could possibly be.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.460]   We as Christians are called to faith,
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.380]   which means that when we see the world,
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.340]   we don't ignore the challenges and the difficulties,
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.620]   but we should see beyond what we see in the physical
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.900]   and we should begin to see with eyes of faith.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.700]   We should begin to see what God is doing in the spiritual
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.180]   'cause you know that there's two realms
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.940]   happening all the time, amen?
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.100]   There's the physical reality of what we see,
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.100]   but there's the spiritual realm of what God is doing.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.780]   And so often God is calling forth the things
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.820]   that are not as if they were.
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.740]   And this is interesting 'cause we Christians
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.940]   should embrace this, but we so often don't.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.980]   In fact, when we see the world,
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.380]   when we see people, we so often call out what we see
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.140]   and we wag a finger and we judge and we pull down
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.140]   and we criticize and we gossip and we do all the things
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.700]   that the world does and nothing separates us.
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.860]   But we should see the brokenness in this world,
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.180]   the injustice and the poverty and the suffering
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.780]   and the cruelty, and we should see beyond it
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.020]   to how God sees it.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.900]   We should get a compassion for it.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.660]   We should weep on its behalf and we should rise up in faith
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.620]   and wanna do something about it.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.740]   We should be the ones that see the world
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.540]   in a different way.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:34.540]   We should as Christians look upon say a drug addict
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.700]   and we should see yes, the ravages of the chemicals
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.980]   that are hurting that person and what they're doing
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.060]   and the addictive behavior and lifestyle that's coming for.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.420]   We shouldn't ignore the reality of what we see,
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.940]   but when we see a drug addict as a Christian,
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.580]   you should see that reality,
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.060]   but then you should also begin to see,
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.020]   oh man, I can see this man,
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.620]   how he would be if he was restored back to health,
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.140]   how if Christ came into his life and began to minister to him
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.500]   how he began to get the help and the freedom he needs.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.500]   I can see this person back in a community thriving again
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.180]   with a job, looking healthy.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.180]   I can see this person's life turn around.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.860]   I refuse to settle with what my eyes tell me.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.100]   I will look with what my spirit tells me
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.860]   and this one can be alive.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.500]   We might look at a friend who's depressed right now
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.940]   and struggling with mental health issues
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.660]   and perhaps they were a great friend of ours
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.140]   and we had done a lot with them,
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.500]   but they've gotten kind of weird
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.260]   and it's not nice to be around them anymore
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.380]   and we're struggling with that
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.940]   and we're not hanging out with them as much
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.860]   and we're not even sure
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.540]   if we're really that good friends or not
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:39.180]   and if we only see with what our eyes tell us to see,
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.900]   if we live without faith,
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.380]   we're just gonna label them
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.500]   as somebody who's just got some mental health challenges,
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.540]   we're gonna leave them alone,
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.260]   but imagine if you had faith,
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.820]   the assurance of what you do not see
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:51.860]   and you look upon them
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.020]   and again, you see what's going on in their lives,
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.060]   you don't downplay it, you don't ignore it,
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.300]   the reality of the depression that's upon them,
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.180]   but you begin to see them free from that depression.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.500]   You begin to see that the spirit of God could move
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.620]   and do something in their lives.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.340]   You believe that there is some therapy
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.140]   and some help that could come alongside of them
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.900]   and revitalize who they are
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.180]   and you can see them again,
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.540]   healthy and full and flourishing
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.020]   and so when you look at them,
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.940]   you do not look without faith
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:22.460]   because if all you ever see is what is presented before you,
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.820]   how are you ever gonna be an agent of change
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.020]   for Christ in the world?
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.180]   Come on church.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:34.420]   The advent is this invitation to us
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.420]   to find ourselves being truly human again.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.900]   To say that it's not easy to live
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.180]   between the birth and the return of Christ,
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.060]   but we are not left alone in the gaps
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.180]   that we all feel that no, there is faith.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.500]   This faith that pleases God,
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.980]   that separates us from the animal world around us
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.540]   and makes us truly as we were created to be
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:58.220]   and this faith is the confidence in what I'm hoping for.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.500]   It is the assurance about what I currently do not see
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.860]   and I wanna live that kind of life
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.300]   because I believe that life changes the world.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:11.340]   It's this kind of faith
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.780]   and actually the lack of it as well
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.660]   that you see throughout the Christmas story.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.820]   I wonder if you've ever thought
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.140]   about the Christmas story in this way.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.820]   Zachariah is a great example to us
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.940]   at the beginning of the Christmas story
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.980]   of one who did not have this kind of faith
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.900]   and when angel Gabriel showed up in the temple
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:32.660]   and said, Elizabeth is pregnant, she's gonna have a child,
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.660]   his immediate response is basically,
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.220]   I have confidence in what I have
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.140]   and I only see with my eyes what I see
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:44.020]   and what I have right now is old age and an old wife.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.820]   What I see is years and years and years of infertility.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.460]   I don't believe you
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.540]   and God brings a judgment on Zachariah
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.260]   because of that, he goes mute for the rest of the story
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.860]   until she gives birth but Elizabeth, this is interesting,
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.420]   where Zachariah struggles with that kind of faith,
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.100]   Elizabeth has it.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.460]   So when she hears the news that this is going to happen,
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.820]   she immediately turns to God and she says,
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.740]   it is going to happen the way you had it
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.220]   and she said, it's because you are pleased with me
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.660]   which is an interesting play on this idea of faith
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.220]   enables us to please God
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.140]   but our faith makes him pleased with us.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:24.100]   Mary, when Gabriel shows up to her and says,
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.940]   okay, I know that you're an unmarried teenager
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.700]   but you're about to have a baby,
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.620]   she's like, now, if that had been me,
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.540]   I would have had confidence in what I have
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.780]   and I would see what it is that I see
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.540]   and I'd be like, I haven't had sex, I'm a virgin.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.540]   This is never gonna happen, this is not gonna happen,
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.740]   this is not gonna go the way it is, I don't believe it
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.140]   and instead, her response is this beautiful response,
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.940]   one of the most beautiful things that is said,
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.580]   one of the most greatest statements of faith
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.500]   we have in all the scripture, she simply says,
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.700]   may it be done with me as you have commanded
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:36:00.100]   'cause she could see and she hoped for something
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.500]   that was different in the world
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.180]   than what she currently could see
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.140]   and what she thought she had.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.420]   You go through the whole story this way,
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.620]   Joseph willing to marry her,
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.300]   God speaking to him in a dream
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.460]   and saying, don't give up on this.
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.740]   Again, if he had based himself in the present reality,
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.980]   he would have wanted to run away.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.740]   Instead, he decides to have confidence
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:18.580]   in what he hopes for,
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.460]   he decides to see what is currently not yet seen
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.500]   and he decides to continue in the relationship
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.420]   and marry her.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.340]   The shepherds, they decide to leave their sheep behind
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.740]   and go and meet with Jesus, that was a radical decision.
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.460]   They were basically giving up all of their livelihood
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.940]   and leaving that behind and moving towards Christ.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.820]   Then you've got Simeon and Anna in the temple
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.580]   on the eighth day when Jesus comes in,
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.020]   their whole lives were built on faith.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.780]   They refused to only believe what they had,
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.500]   they refused to only see what was around them.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.380]   Instead, they had dedicated their whole lives in the temple
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.260]   to hope for the coming of the Messiah,
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:59.060]   to believe that they would see it with their own eyes.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.180]   That's actually what Simeon says when he sees Jesus,
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.140]   he says, I now can see with my own eyes
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.980]   the thing that I had been assured of
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.420]   that I didn't yet see, I now see
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.460]   and because I now see it,
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.940]   you can actually let your faithful servant go to rest.
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.780]   In other words, the faith has come through.
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:22.100]   The Christmas story is filled with this invitation to faith
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.700]   and when we live in this Advent season of the now
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:29.020]   but not yet, our cry is to move in that direction,
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.180]   to find faith rising up in us.
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.020]   This confidence of what we hope for,
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.860]   this assurance of what we do not yet see
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.660]   and when we live like that,
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:44.780]   we truly show the world what it is that God is going to do.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.180]   Now each week, I wanna help you to wrestle
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.820]   with these concepts in the week ahead
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.020]   and last week, I gave you a series of questions,
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.460]   hopefully you did them
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.220]   during some quiet time throughout your week.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.980]   If you didn't, I still love you.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.900]   I'm not happy with you but I still love you, okay?
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.300]   And I have another series of questions
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.340]   that I want you to take a photo of
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.260]   and I wanna invite you over the week
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.420]   to spend 30 minutes or so reflecting on your answers.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.500]   So you can take a photo of this slide.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.100]   What usually comes to mind when you think about faith
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.420]   and how has the teaching today
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.220]   helped to redefine this bit for you?
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.180]   In this moment of your life,
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.060]   what does exercising faith look like for you?
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.860]   Where is God asking you personally
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.060]   to have confidence in what you hope for
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.820]   and assurance in what you do not see?
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.380]   Where are you currently holding on
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.540]   to what you have more than what you hope for?
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.780]   Where are you currently seeing only what is present
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.700]   rather than what is promised?
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.700]   I think if you took 30 minutes or so this week
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.380]   and you really were honest with yourself
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.260]   about those questions, I believe for some of you,
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.460]   this would be the starting point
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:50.820]   from shifting from a fateful life to a faithful life.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.540]   And it may not be easy and there may be some work
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.340]   that you need to do with the Holy Spirit in this process
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.140]   but this is Advent, this is what we are called to do.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.780]   We want to live on behalf of God's grand vision
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:02.860]   at the end of all things
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.220]   and we want that to have an impact and to change this world.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.460]   Think of it this way, God does not want you to settle
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.460]   for the history of humanity.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:15.260]   He wants you actually to fight for the future of humanity.
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:21.260]   The only way that we can do that is if we have faith.
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.780]   Can I pray for you?
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:23.620]   Let's pray.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.420]   Lord, we are so grateful for Advent,
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.060]   for this now but not yet time
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.340]   where we see through a mirror darkly,
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.060]   where we don't have all the answers.
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:40.100]   We're grateful that you haven't left us alone in that space,
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.780]   that your Spirit is present here with us
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.740]   in its fullness within us and around us
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.740]   and that we have this thing called faith,
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:52.700]   not a set of doctrinal beliefs as important as they are
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.700]   but actually a complete trust in you.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.620]   So much trust in you that we actually let go of our trust
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.180]   of what we see right now
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.860]   and our trust in what we have right now,
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.060]   grateful as we are for those things
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.940]   'cause they've come from you
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.620]   but if our trust is in only what we have,
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:12.580]   if our sight is in only what we currently see,
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.660]   then we're making those our God rather than you.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.940]   And Lord, you shift us to have a confidence
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:20.780]   in what we hope for,
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.900]   an assurance about what we do not yet see.
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.780]   You shift us out of making idols of our possessions
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:30.780]   and you help us to give our lives to expectation.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:35.980]   You take us out of being trapped in the past and the present
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:40.860]   and you invite us to life with the future before us.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.780]   And Father, as you pulled back that curtain
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.220]   and showed us what the end of the world will look like
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.340]   with every tribe and tongue and nation coming together
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.580]   with healing being there for all nations,
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.660]   Father, we wanna live on behalf of that now.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.700]   Lord, would you help us to separate ourselves
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.300]   from the animal world around us?
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.580]   Lord, we recognize that if we live without faith,
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.780]   we are no better than any of your other species.
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.380]   You have called and created us in your image
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.900]   and faith is our way that brings pleasure to you.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.740]   So Lord, I wanna pray for anyone in this room
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.980]   where this message is really hitting for them.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.380]   And perhaps they recognize more fateful thinking
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.540]   than faithful thinking.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.100]   Perhaps they see how they're tethered to what they have
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.060]   and not free to long for what they do not have.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:30.940]   As I'm praying, I wanna say this to some of you.
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:35.220]   Some of you are remaining in a job that you hate
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.220]   rather than having the courage to search
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.020]   for the one that you've always longed for
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.420]   because you put more trust in what you have
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:42.740]   than in what you hope for.
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:47.460]   I believe that's for some of you here in a relationship.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.980]   You're in a relationship that you know
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.740]   is not healthy for you, that is not helping you
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.260]   and yet you're remaining in that relationship
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.420]   'cause you have more trust in what you have
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:00.180]   than trust in what you're hoping for.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:04.260]   So Lord, if there's anybody here
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.860]   where that resonates for them,
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.500]   Lord, I wanna pray again for the liberation
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.180]   that comes from the work of your Spirit in our lives.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.980]   Lord, I wanna pray that we would have the courage
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.700]   to live with faith.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.100]   And that in so doing, we would become the people
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.540]   that you've created us to be.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.180]   And we would help to see this world move towards
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.780]   that grand vision of every tribe, tongue and nation
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.540]   worshiping you, of all of the healing
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.940]   on the leaves of the tree in that beautiful city
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.380]   that's to come.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:37.140]   That we would say, that's the vision that drives my heart.
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.500]   I wanna live for the future, not past.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.340]   Lord, this is faith.
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:47.300]   I wanna just encourage you just to receive that now.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.780]   The Bible says that faith is a gift of the Spirit.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:55.260]   So I wanna pray for the Spirit of God just to come
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.140]   and stir great faith in some of you.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:02.380]   Some of you, it's been about faith too long.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.620]   It's time for you to move in faith.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.300]   It's gonna take courage.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.980]   It's gonna take a different way of thinking,
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.220]   but that is the way you will please the Lord.
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.300]   Lord, would you release faith in the name of Jesus
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.220]   over these people?
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.620]   Lord, would faith rise up?
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.580]   Faith rise up.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:26.300]   Lord, give us eyes to see what we currently do not see.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:32.260]   Give us hope where hope feels like it's been stolen from us.
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:36.780]   Revitalize our humanity.
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.980]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.780]   Everyone says, amen.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.740]   Hey, would you stand with me?
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.660]   And we're gonna just finish our time together
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.300]   responding in just a time of worship
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.460]   in response to what the Lord is doing here.
