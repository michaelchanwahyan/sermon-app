1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
 in Jesus' name, amen.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,560
 - Thank you, Carla.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,980
 Good afternoon, all of you.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,120
 Most happy to share a word with you.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,100
 Some 30 years ago, exactly this time,

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,520
 I continued my post-graduate training.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,280
 By the way, I graduated from Hong Kong U.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,180
 I know that some of you are coming from Hong Kong U today.

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,800
 So 30 years ago, I went overseas

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,920
 to this very, very small city.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,440
 Okay, don't be offended if you came from that city.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,640
 St. Louis, Missouri Midwest.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,840
 Okay, I was doing an overseas fellowship training,

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,040
 and there I learned from a leading expert

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,400
 in my medical line, who had contributed tremendously

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,320
 in that particular field.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,940
 So he made numerous attempts to introduce

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,560
 various new surgical procedures

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,560
 that really was the forefront of imagination at that time.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,740
 But he overcame many hurdles and reticules along the way.

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,560
 Some of his attempts failed altogether,

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,320
 but there are many others that flourished

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,520
 and changed the surgical paradigm altogether.

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,520
 He always reminded us that not all new things are good,

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,100
 but all good things must be new at one time.

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,300
 How true.

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,320
 So in a sense, my mentor journeyed

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,880
 through many uncharted waters in his times,

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,220
 where he championed the advance

30
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,240
 of what is now commonplace, keyhole surgery.

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,160
 He contributed to bringing a whole new beginning

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,080
 in surgical practices.

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,880
 And I'm glad that I rode along on that wave.

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,400
 In fact, I found this word beginning an amazing word.

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,100
 In Greek, it reads, "akhi,"

36
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,500
 which carries the meaning of origin,

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,300
 the beginning event, early days.

38
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,700
 And I'm particularly impressed when I read through

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,700
 how different gospel writers begin their beginnings.

40
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,740
 So through the beginning of the story of Jesus Christ

41
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,140
 in the Gospels of John, Luke, and Mark,

42
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,260
 I hoped to explore the very subject,

43
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,520
 passing on, ending, and new beginnings.

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,340
 John 1, 1 says, "In the beginning."

45
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,920
 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.

46
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,140
 And the Word was God.

47
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,280
 He was with God in the beginning.

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,920
 Now, it is groundbreaking to have a whole new understanding

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,960
 of the word logos, which is translated as Word,

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,140
 or living Word.

51
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,260
 And to understand that Jesus is that living Word.

52
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,000
 John also asserts that Jesus, the Word,

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,360
 was with God from the very beginning.

54
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,540
 And you appreciate how he refers to Genesis

55
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,580
 when he wrote the Gospel.

56
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,520
 The very first verse of the entire Bible,

57
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,480
 "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,420
 And that was exactly the same beginning.

59
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,700
 We can read the creation account of the beginning

60
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,660
 as a celebration of God's goodness and faithfulness.

61
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,080
 And indeed, when he created, he said, "This is good."

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,340
 It is significant to note that all beginnings,

63
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,340
 all our beginnings, are very much anchored in his beginning,

64
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,620
 because he is the one who begins in creation

65
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,120
 in the first place.

66
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,980
 All that we have planned for is already obtained by God.

67
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,620
 And we celebrate new beginnings exactly

68
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,240
 because God has been good and faithful

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,580
 from the very beginning.

70
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,140
 How about Luke?

71
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,400
 Here is what he wrote.

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,340
 "Many have taken to draw up an account of the things

73
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,960
 that had been fulfilled amongst us,

74
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,460
 just as they were handed down to us

75
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,680
 by those who from the first were eyewitnesses

76
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,640
 and servants of the word."

77
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,180
 From the first, which is the same word as beginning.

78
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,980
 And what an awesome task.

79
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,060
 Handed down is a very strong word

80
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,800
 that is really passing on something precious

81
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,920
 and important to the next one.

82
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,160
 And in fact, in ancient times, including Jewish culture,

83
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,400
 oral tradition is the main way whereby truth

84
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,180
 was communicated along and from generations to generations.

85
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,260
 In fact, passing on of the oral tradition

86
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,760
 was the important basis for the spread

87
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,200
 of early Christianity.

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,560
 The gospels, as we know today,

89
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,560
 was actually written much later, probably after AD 70.

90
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,340
 By then, Jerusalem was destroyed by the Roman Empire,

91
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,000
 and the Jewish Christians were actually driven out

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,420
 of Jerusalem.

93
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,140
 But through the oral tradition, through the passing on,

94
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,640
 the very core message of Christianity was preserved

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,620
 and subsequently written down in the gospel.

96
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,700
 Passing on of truth is a noble task.

97
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,920
 The same significance of passing on

98
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,780
 was also emphasized by the Apostle Paul

99
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,980
 when he wrote to the church in Corinth.

100
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,560
 For what I received, I passed on to you

101
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,520
 as of first importance, that Christ died for our sins,

102
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,800
 according to the scriptures.

103
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,800
 The gospel permeated the entire Greek Roman world,

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,200
 and it is by believers who passed on the very truth.

105
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,880
 The next question for us is, as modern day believers,

106
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,120
 what have we got to pass on to others?

107
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,460
 My wife and I planned carefully for what we wanted

108
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,360
 to pass on to our two children, who are now adults,

109
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,860
 well, maybe some years down the road.

110
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,520
 So we drew up a will, which was duly signed

111
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,140
 by eyewitnesses, that our material estate

112
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,400
 would be equally distributed between the two of them.

113
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,120
 But I also wonder whether I've also passed on

114
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,160
 a rich spiritual inheritance to each of them.

115
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,340
 I'm glad that as my daughter entered into marital life,

116
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,780
 we passed on the love that we have

117
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,500
 for each other as a spouse.

118
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,080
 Besides loving God, loving our spouse

119
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,080
 is the single most important calling for us married people.

120
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,360
 As for my son, who is not yet married,

121
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,360
 I hope I can pass on to him my love for family,

122
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,520
 commitment to work, independence,

123
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,000
 and the ability to maintain hope

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,580
 in the face of life's challenges.

125
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,600
 I do recognize that my mom passed on to me

126
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,080
 a lot of pessimism and worries for tomorrow.

127
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,280
 So it takes conscious effort to connect with Jesus

128
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,900
 to renew my mind and my perspective

129
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,920
 so that I can bring joy into my own being

130
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,480
 and so that I can pass on joy to people around me.

131
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,920
 How about you?

132
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,800
 There are practical ways that we can pass on

133
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,320
 our love for people, our values, our hopes, and our dreams.

134
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,900
 I came across a few consecutive couples here in the Vine

135
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,920
 who are in the process of adopting children

136
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,240
 into their family.

137
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,600
 What a tremendous blessing that they shall be mutually

138
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,760
 for parents and adoptive children for each other.

139
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,800
 They are passing on the amazing love

140
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,240
 that is originated from our heavenly Father

141
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,160
 who calls each and every one of us into a family.

142
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,360
 And I admire my college mate

143
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,680
 who quit his headmaster job altogether

144
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,840
 to lead an organization that is responsible

145
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,880
 to write up the biblical or religious studies curriculum

146
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,300
 for all the secondary and primary schools here in Hong Kong.

147
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,240
 He's passing on biblical values

148
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,840
 to our very next generation.

149
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,480
 And he bridged many local churches,

150
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,000
 including the Vine at Yuen Long,

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,220
 to participate in the program.

152
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,520
 Many congregants volunteer as mentors in these schools.

153
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,360
 And along the way, with wisdom and with respect

154
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,340
 to the entire education system,

155
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,860
 they were able to bring many school students to Christ.

156
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,640
 What do you want to pass on to people around you?

157
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,840
 And while it is still early part of the year,

158
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,060
 how would you like to begin this year?

159
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,980
 Let's shall continue today's sharing on beginning and end.

160
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,860
 In a nutshell, interestingly,

161
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,220
 every beginning is the end of another beginning.

162
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,480
 And every beginning should be aimed

163
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,420
 towards a predetermined end.

164
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,460
 So how are we going to understand this?

165
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,220
 Well, maybe we can draw a reference

166
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,140
 from the book of Hebrews,

167
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,260
 where we are asked to fix our eyes upon Jesus,

168
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,820
 the pioneer and perfecter of faith.

169
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,340
 The root word of pioneer in Greek is that of akhi,

170
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,340
 our key word today, beginnings.

171
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,780
 Whereas perfecter is rooted in the Greek word,

172
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,680
 telos, the end.

173
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,580
 So Jesus sees us through from the beginning to the end.

174
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,420
 So let us throw off everything that hinders

175
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,500
 and the sin that so easily entangles.

176
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,

177
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,060
 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer, the beginner,

178
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,160
 and the perfecter of faith.

179
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,060
 Now we just talked about passing on,

180
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,260
 but paradoxically, sometimes new beginning

181
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,740
 is also about closure of the past.

182
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,800
 Let's refer to the gospel of Mark

183
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,260
 to look at how this interesting interaction

184
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,260
 between endings and beginning.

185
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,920
 Mark one, the beginning of the good news

186
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,180
 about Jesus, the Messiah, the son of God.

187
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,620
 As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee,

188
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,220
 he saw Simon and his brother Andrew

189
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,660
 casting a net into the lake, for they are fishermen.

190
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,660
 Come, follow me, and I will send you out to fish for people.

191
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,120
 At once, they left their nets and followed him.

192
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,540
 Now this is a call for a new beginning,

193
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,780
 but it actually begins with a closure of a prior chapter

194
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,520
 for Peter and the first disciples.

195
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,760
 This calling of the first disciples,

196
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,520
 as recorded in Mark's gospel,

197
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,540
 is not following a particular miracle or a great sermon.

198
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,880
 It begins as a simple call

199
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,140
 to four ordinary people to follow him.

200
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:41,480
 It's a simple call for ordinary people like us to follow him.

201
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,440
 The Sea of Galilee is a beautiful lake.

202
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,840
 In the first century, the main staple of food

203
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,060
 is actually fish, not meat in that sense.

204
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,040
 The fishing industry in the Sea of Galilee is so prosperous

205
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,360
 that the catch was not only consumed in the local market.

206
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,720
 Fish from Galilee were actually exported as far away

207
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,400
 as Alexandria in Egypt and Antioch in Syria.

208
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,120
 So the fishermen in Galilee competed

209
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,400
 in the larger Mediterranean market,

210
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,440
 demonstrating the skill and probably their mastery of Greek,

211
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,320
 which was the international language

212
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,840
 of commerce and culture.

213
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,400
 So the fishermen Jesus caught

214
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,760
 were not necessarily just dispensable day laborers.

215
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,900
 To survive in the market, they need to be savvy

216
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,480
 and are probably successful small businessmen.

217
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,280
 On the backgrounds of these first generation disciples,

218
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,780
 somewhat like many of us here in this congregation,

219
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,060
 we work hard in the society,

220
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,360
 contributing in our own respective professions.

221
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,840
 Others are working in a booming or challenging business.

222
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,000
 And many of us are bilingual,

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,520
 and some are even engaged in international trade.

224
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,800
 Is Jesus also calling some of us,

225
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,800
 or rather all of us who happen to be in this city,

226
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,680
 but yet by his divine purpose?

227
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,400
 But to start with,

228
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,060
 there needs to be some closure to prior chapters.

229
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,240
 The cross is laid on every single Christian.

230
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,360
 The first suffering in following Jesus,

231
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,640
 which every believer need to experience is the call,

232
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,820
 is the call to abandon the attachments of this world.

233
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,880
 As we embark on our journey to follow him,

234
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,880
 we surrender ourselves to Christ in union with his death,

235
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,800
 we give our lives.

236
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,580
 Thus it begins.

237
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,700
 The cross meets us at the beginning of our journey.

238
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:59,640
 Van Hove wrote very heavy words in his famous book,

239
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,220
 "The Cause of Discipleship."

240
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,140
 When Christ calls a man,

241
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
 it bids him come and die.

242
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,640
 Following Jesus is a costly and serious matter.

243
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,040
 Our beginning start with letting go of the past,

244
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,080
 of the old is a kind of death,

245
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,720
 and a picking up of our cross.

246
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,280
 I shared a very similar experience and challenge

247
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,360
 some 40 years ago,

248
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,400
 but with a very dissimilar choice

249
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,000
 from that of the disciples.

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,660
 I was about to enter medical school,

251
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,540
 and on that particular summer,

252
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,640
 the theme of the church camp was,

253
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,000
 surrender ourselves to serve.

254
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,880
 So I hesitate to embrace the call,

255
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,680
 and I would not like to end my chapter and my career,

256
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,260
 which has not even started.

257
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,140
 So I wrestled, I made a subtle decision,

258
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,520
 maybe this call is not for me.

259
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,260
 If anything, that should be responded

260
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,140
 to some years down the road.

261
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,820
 Now very sadly, that deferral to some years down the road,

262
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,940
 to avail myself, turned out to become decades.

263
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,340
 In fact, I backslided, I detour,

264
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,460
 and it took a long while for me to come back to Jesus.

265
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,900
 I wondered what my path could have been

266
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,260
 if I had made a different response

267
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,200
 to the call in the first place.

268
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,500
 Well, one never really knows,

269
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,780
 but as I've just shared,

270
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,740
 that chapter has closed,

271
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,400
 be it a bad or a good choice.

272
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,820
 Fast forward, I've been attending this church

273
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,900
 for the past 16 years,

274
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,700
 and I served as elder for the past nine years.

275
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,420
 I still remember the first time

276
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,260
 where we gathered on a hot summer evening,

277
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,860
 and that was without air conditioning,

278
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,460
 in the unfinished auditorium,

279
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,380
 that we attended the very first worship service

280
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,780
 here in the wine.

281
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,140
 The auditorium was as hot as a furnace,

282
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,420
 but our passion drove us to complete the renovation.

283
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,420
 I also remembered in the early days,

284
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,840
 we were so short of cash and funds,

285
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,460
 we didn't even have enough money flow

286
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,720
 to pay our employees' monthly salaries.

287
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,060
 We knelt, we confessed our sins,

288
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,320
 and we prayed for God's favor.

289
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,520
 And it was through the faithfulness of God

290
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,180
 and of the congregation that sometime down the road,

291
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,240
 we were able to pay off the debts,

292
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,100
 and we remained financially stable.

293
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,920
 Here in the church,

294
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,480
 we also witnessed incredible growth

295
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,400
 beyond our imagination,

296
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,280
 with more than 2,400 people

297
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,300
 attending our four Sunday services for a season.

298
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,560
 Yet, we also went through the challenges

299
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,840
 of social movements and the COVID restrictions.

300
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,800
 After COVID, the attendance of one child

301
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,820
 dropped to an average of 1,500.

302
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,500
 How shall we move forward?

303
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,360
 Now, interesting and amazingly,

304
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,680
 it was in this difficulty

305
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,600
 that our very first church plant at Yuen Long was burned.

306
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,760
 Praise God.

307
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,400
 So while serving as an elder

308
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,240
 and chairman of the board through this season,

309
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,340
 it has been instrumental and life-changing for me.

310
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,920
 I want to, on behalf of the past eldership board,

311
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,240
 and including those who have stepped down

312
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,000
 after many years of faithful service,

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,520
 and also those who are still serving in the current board,

314
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,120
 we want to thank you, all of you,

315
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,400
 allowing us the privilege to serve

316
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,280
 in areas of spiritual directions,

317
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,400
 governance, financial prudence, and corporate leadership.

318
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,680
 For myself, on a personal note,

319
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,200
 I am stepping down, and I have stepped down, by the way.

320
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,880
 I've stepped down according to the rule of congregation,

321
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,800
 and I take it as a blessing in disguise.

322
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,800
 I did receive the word, "New wine in new wine skin."

323
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,640
 For anything new to happen,

324
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,760
 there has to be an end to the prior chapter.

325
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,000
 How I will serve in the next season

326
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,680
 is something that God will continue to reveal.

327
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,400
 God willing, I do hope that there will be future occasions

328
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,280
 that I may stand on this pulpit

329
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,960
 to share God's word with all of you.

330
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,440
 Paul could proudly say at the end of the season

331
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,880
 that he has fought the good fight,

332
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,720
 he has finished the race, and he has kept the faith.

333
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,800
 However, sometimes we don't wrap up our past properly.

334
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,480
 How do we know that we didn't end well?

335
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,920
 Well, when we couldn't stop thinking about the past,

336
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,320
 but keep on chewing on the hurtful experience,

337
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,760
 we felt angry and frustrated

338
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,360
 because of the sadness or pain in our life,

339
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,360
 and we struggled to encounter God in those difficult moments

340
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,360
 and we declined to enter into new commitments

341
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,360
 in life, in relationship, or in ministries.

342
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,520
 Somewhere last year,

343
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,520
 when I no longer received the honorary academic title

344
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,840
 conferred to me by the university over the years,

345
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,280
 I was really upset.

346
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,880
 I thought, well, I made very significant contributions.

347
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,320
 I thought I mentored many,

348
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,560
 and I inspired many others.

349
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,160
 The list kept going.

350
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,600
 But then I come to my sense,

351
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,920
 well, I've left the academic field

352
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
 for good number of years.

353
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,280
 A closure is a closure.

354
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,800
 I can choose to embrace my new role as peers

355
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,200
 to my fellow colleagues,

356
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,440
 including those who are younger than me,

357
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,960
 but who may be brighter or even more skillful.

358
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,800
 I can choose to continue to teach the medical students,

359
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,760
 regardless of whether I have or do not have academic title.

360
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,280
 I can choose to fully commit myself

361
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,360
 to patient care on personal levels.

362
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,800
 I can explore new ventures in life.

363
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,800
 By the way, I learned to play tennis since two years ago.

364
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,280
 It would be helpful for us to consider the features

365
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,280
 of emotionally healthy endings and new beginnings.

366
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,840
 Healthy endings and new beginnings,

367
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,640
 when we can patiently wait for the ending

368
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,840
 and the confusion in between,

369
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,480
 fully aware that it can take much longer

370
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,680
 than we can imagine.

371
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,720
 When we realize that the ending and the waiting

372
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,720
 are closely tied to our maturity in Christ,

373
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,280
 and we can firmly affirm that endings and waiting

374
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,000
 are the gateway to new beginnings.

375
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,440
 If we accept those losses,

376
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,520
 whether it's work, a relationship that comes to an end,

377
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,360
 or even a failed ministry,

378
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,280
 God will work profoundly in and through us

379
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,800
 in the way that the apostle Paul describes.

380
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,480
 So then, death is a work in us,

381
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,240
 but life is a work in you.

382
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,320
 Even Jesus says, "Very truly I tell you,

383
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,480
 unless a canal of wheat falls to the ground and dies,

384
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,040
 it remains only a single seed.

385
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,240
 But if it dies, it produces many seeds.

386
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,280
 If it dies, it produces many seeds."

387
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,200
 I don't know whether you understand

388
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,200
 how the essence of cancer or cancer progression is like.

389
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,560
 In short, cancer cells do not complete

390
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,560
 their original life cycle at the appropriate time,

391
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,080
 according to normal life design,

392
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,400
 but instead becomes vicious cells that drags on,

393
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,680
 and the culprit that endangers life.

394
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,720
 When I was diagnosed with leukemia some years back,

395
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,640
 the idea of target therapy that I received

396
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,200
 was exactly to let the medicine create an environment

397
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,280
 for those cancer cells to die,

398
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,120
 so that healthy cells would reappear in the future.

399
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,040
 When I received the treatment,

400
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,080
 I was literally thinking I was dying.

401
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,520
 It was very, very bad.

402
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,280
 But here I am, recently healthy and strong.

403
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
 Praise God.

404
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,880
 Yeah, thank you.

405
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,720
 Praise God.

406
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,520
 Maybe we should ask ourselves,

407
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,360
 if I accept this ending of my current life situation,

408
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,120
 what new things might be standing in the background,

409
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,040
 waiting to come into my personal life?

410
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,720
 What is waiting in the background,

411
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,560
 coming into my personal life?

412
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,600
 When we face the end of a chapter in our lives,

413
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,080
 God's will is not just to change the external environment.

414
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,720
 Rather, he's doing something greater,

415
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,760
 initiating a deeper transformation within us

416
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,800
 that goes beyond our imagination.

417
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,320
 I like the quote by Parker Palmer.

418
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,920
 He says, "On the spiritual journey,

419
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,600
 "each time a door closes,

420
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,680
 "the rest of the world opens up.

421
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:42,240
 "All we need to do is to stop pounding on the door

422
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,760
 "that just closed, but turn around."

423
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,760
 Indeed, we turn around and push the door behind us

424
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,800
 and welcome the largeness of life

425
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,280
 that now lies open to our souls.

426
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,880
 So, don't pound on the closed door.

427
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,680
 Embrace the new.

428
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,320
 So I want to invite you to do a very prophetic act.

429
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,720
 Okay, I want you all to stand.

430
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,400
 Okay, follow me.

431
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,240
 Okay.

432
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,960
 Stand.

433
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,360
 Okay, because we are reminded we can turn around

434
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,440
 and put the closed door behind us.

435
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,280
 So all of us, turn around.

436
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,720
 (audience laughs)

437
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,600
 Yes, put the closed door behind us.

438
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,120
 Welcome the new life that God has prepared for you.

439
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,360
 Come, please take a seat.

440
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,360
 (audience applauds)

441
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,920
 Well, but then you may want to ask,

442
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,680
 how then should we embark on a new journey?

443
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,840
 Stephen Covey teaches in his best-selling book,

444
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,360
 "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People."

445
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,160
 One of the habits is paradoxically,

446
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,240
 begin with the end in mind.

447
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,000
 Well, maybe Stephen have Paul's encouragement in mind

448
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,800
 when he writes his book.

449
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,640
 As Paul says, "I do not consider myself

450
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,600
 "yet to have taken hold of it.

451
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,400
 "But one thing I do, forgetting what is behind

452
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,280
 "and straining towards what is ahead.

453
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,920
 "I press on towards the goal."

454
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,120
 In this chapter, Stephen challenges all of us to imagine

455
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,840
 attending our own funeral.

456
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,320
 Wow.

457
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,320
 And we shall hear from our family, our friends,

458
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,400
 our colleagues, and our fellow congregants,

459
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,840
 how they remember us.

460
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,560
 Well, that is indeed a challenge

461
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,800
 because much often we will ask,

462
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,800
 well, what do I want to accomplish by the end of 2025?

463
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,960
 How would I like my family to be like in three years?

464
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,400
 Or what do I expect my ministry to be in five years?

465
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,960
 Maybe slightly longer down the road when I retire,

466
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,400
 what kind of legacy I would like to leave behind?

467
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,440
 Well, we best assure we can and we should

468
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,280
 set short-term goals on the way to our long-term life goals.

469
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,240
 But the author reminds us to focus

470
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,240
 on the ultimate goals that really matter,

471
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,240
 lest we lean our leather against the wrong wall.

472
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,200
 I try to practice this principle in my own life.

473
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,960
 So for the past decade or so,

474
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,760
 we will organize a gathering of friends, family,

475
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,760
 coworkers, and church members every few years

476
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,640
 so that we can celebrate our birthday

477
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,200
 or our wedding anniversaries.

478
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,400
 So about eight years ago,

479
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,440
 we celebrated our 21st wedding anniversary.

480
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,200
 Yay.

481
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,000
 (audience applauding)

482
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,160
 Well, but we also took a very bold step

483
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,480
 to break the news to our guests

484
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,560
 that I was suffering from leukemia.

485
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,880
 And I was about to start my treatment,

486
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,080
 charting into unknown waters at the time.

487
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,560
 So I also took it as a kind of farewell

488
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,480
 in case the treatment didn't go well.

489
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,240
 Fast forward on our recent six years birthday,

490
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,000
 two years ago,

491
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,200
 and we asked our guests to share something

492
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,280
 that they would like to say about us,

493
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,320
 both as an encouragement and also as a measure

494
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,160
 of whether we have passed on something

495
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,440
 that is worth remembering for them.

496
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,480
 If we kind of think deeply,

497
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,400
 how do I want these relatives and friends

498
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,800
 to evaluate my life?

499
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,800
 What kind of husband, wife, father, or mother

500
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,760
 do we want them to remember?

501
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,240
 What kind of friends, what kind of work partner

502
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,880
 are we for them?

503
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,600
 What qualities do I want them to see in me?

504
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,320
 What contributions, what achievements

505
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,320
 do I want them to remember?

506
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,840
 But maybe the pen ultimate question should be,

507
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,200
 will I be called the good and faithful servant

508
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,560
 that I may be invited to Jesus' banquet

509
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,680
 to celebrate together?

510
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,440
 If I look at people closely around me,

511
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,440
 what change do I want to see, make in their lives?

512
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,320
 So if my ultimate goal is to see the transformation

513
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,840
 of the life of others, I should start

514
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,240
 with my own personal choices, my priorities,

515
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,160
 and my life as a believer.

516
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,840
 When Jesus first called Peter,

517
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,800
 he already had an end in mind for Peter.

518
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,880
 It's a call to ministry, and Jesus said,

519
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,720
 "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of man."

520
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,720
 The Greek wording is, "I will make you fishers of man."

521
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,120
 The Greek has the sense of making change to become.

522
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,520
 It's a dual process, and it's a long process

523
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,560
 for Peter and the disciples for at least three years.

524
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:25,080
 A call can indeed completely change our course.

525
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,880
 About 20 years ago, when I was still living

526
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,360
 and working in Singapore, I received a call from Hong Kong.

527
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,640
 There was an invitation for me to join

528
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,760
 one of the local universities, and we decided

529
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,920
 to take up that challenge for me professionally,

530
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,080
 and for the family to start a new life

531
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,040
 here in Hong Kong again after a 10-year stay in Singapore.

532
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,360
 For me, that was a new beginning,

533
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,840
 where my end goal is to leave a legacy,

534
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,280
 or at least make a difference.

535
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,840
 And returning that call changed the trajectory

536
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,560
 of my whole life.

537
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,240
 God had a wonderful plan.

538
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,320
 When we returned to Hong Kong and were looking for a church,

539
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,720
 we stumbled into Divine Church,

540
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,280
 and Vivian and I had the privilege to serve in this church,

541
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,280
 especially in the Chinese ministry since then.

542
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,560
 Well, that should be considered a surprising call,

543
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,280
 almost unexpected.

544
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,720
 How about Peter?

545
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,960
 What happened to him upon his saying yes

546
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,160
 to the first call by Jesus?

547
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,960
 Did he continue to keep his end in mind

548
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,440
 while riding many ups and downs together with Jesus?

549
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,840
 After three years of walking with Jesus,

550
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,120
 Peter, along with all the other first disciples,

551
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,960
 and he entered into a new chapter

552
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,840
 where they will continue to spread the good news

553
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,840
 in Jesus' absence, because Jesus will soon leave them.

554
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,480
 They are about to begin their own new era.

555
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,560
 John 15 says, "When the Advocate comes,

556
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,320
 whom Jesus will send to you from the Father,

557
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,280
 the Spirit of truth who goes out with the Father,

558
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,400
 he will testify about me, Jesus,

559
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,400
 and you, you also must testify,

560
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,360
 for you have been with me from the beginning."

561
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,440
 So Jesus reminds them that they have been with him

562
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,560
 from the beginning, a long circle,

563
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,080
 and we are back to the beginning.

564
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,160
 Peter and the first disciples had the privilege

565
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,960
 of being in fellowship with Jesus from the very beginning,

566
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,440
 and they have a unique anointing.

567
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,680
 You might have been attending the Vine

568
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,040
 for the past three years, or maybe just three months,

569
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,760
 or even three weeks, or you might have been with us

570
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,760
 from that beginning, be it in Central or in Causeway Bay.

571
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,400
 Regardless, we are blessed to be part of a new season

572
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,880
 for this church.

573
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,440
 We'll be part of a new beginning,

574
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,360
 which Andrew will speak to upon next week's Vision Sunday.

575
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,120
 God values us.

576
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,880
 May we spread the good news and keep in mind the end goal,

577
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,640
 which is a citywide transformation

578
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,640
 beyond Wan Chai and Yuen Long.

579
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,440
 Jesus' final instructions to his first disciples

580
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,480
 are the same instructions to all of us here today.

581
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,120
 You and you must bear witness

582
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,120
 because you have been with Jesus from the beginning.

583
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,440
 Our context may differ, but we are in a new beginning

584
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,120
 that God has ordained.

585
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,920
 The New Testament ends beautifully.

586
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,920
 In Revelation, it says, "I am the Alpha and the Omega,

587
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:14,320
 "the first and the last, the beginning and the end,

588
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,240
 "Archi and Talos, the beginning and the end."

589
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,160
 I hope that as we celebrate a new season

590
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,880
 for this faith community,

591
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,960
 each one of us will move towards our life goal.

592
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,960
 And my life goal, as Carla has last mentioned

593
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,040
 in her last sermon, don't hold back.

594
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,880
 Yeah, don't hold back.

595
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,120
 I want to give my best of myself to serve

596
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,320
 in years to come, whatever years he allowed.

597
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,640
 May Divine Church continue to move

598
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,440
 towards Jesus Christ has destined for us.

599
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,760
 Keep moving towards our goal

600
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,120
 so that the gospel and the kingdom of God

601
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,360
 will continue to be passed on.

602
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,480
 Let's ask God to speak to us collectively

603
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,320
 as well as individually,

604
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,360
 so that we hear the call so distinctly

605
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,280
 and that we shall follow him boldly.

606
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,840
 Can I invite the worship team?

607
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,800
 Yeah, and I also would like to invite all of us to stand.

608
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,600
 In a moment's time, I would like all of us

609
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,920
 to consider coming forth for a time of prayer.

610
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,840
 Yeah, because even as you hear the word today,

611
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,560
 and if you want a closure to the past,

612
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:39,560
 ask God to help you close the chapter gracefully.

613
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,000
 And if you want to respond to God

614
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 to head for a new beginning, say yes to Jesus.

615
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,120
 Come and invite Jesus to journey with you.

616
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,280
 And if you want to pass on the blessing,

617
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,800
 including a personal salvation

618
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,600
 that has already been bestowed upon you,

619
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,080
 ask God to help you pass it on.

620
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,040
 So while we respond in worship,

621
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,040
 in a moment's time, I invite many of you to come forth

622
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,000
 and that we shall pray together

623
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,040
 with the pastors and the prayer team.

624
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,640
 (gentle music)

625
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,240
 (gentle music)

626
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,840
 (gentle music)

627
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,440
 (gentle music)

628
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,940
 (music fades)

629
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:38,940
