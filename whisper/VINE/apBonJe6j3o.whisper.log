[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   It's good to have you here.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.800]   So good.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.800]   Well, Happy New Year, everyone.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.000]   How's everyone doing?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.600]   Happy New Year?
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.800]   Oh, that was bad.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.000]   We're going to try that one more time.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.600]   Happy New Year, everybody.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.400]   Yeah, you guys did well.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.900]   You got up for the 11 o'clock service.
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.300]   Well done.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.200]   The really faithful people here at 915.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.500]   I'm just pointing it out.
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.700]   Just pointing it out.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.300]   The really dedicated people here at 915.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.400]   There's about 50 of us in this room, loving Jesus together.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.800]   But we're glad, we're glad that we have a full house at the 11.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.800]   It's so good to see you guys.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.600]   In honor of Pele, who passed away this week,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.000]   I want to start my very first sermon of 2023 with a story about football.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.800]   I know.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.000]   In the fall of 1989,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.900]   I was selected to play football for the Hong Kong national team.
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.300]   Yes. Admittedly, it was the under 14 team.
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.900]   But it was the Hong Kong national football team nonetheless.
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.700]   I was selected along with 24 other school boys to play for Hong Kong.
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.800]   And the reason why we were putting a team together for the under 14s,
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.200]   because there was an upcoming football tournament against China, Indonesia, Philippines and Macau.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.500]   The mighty football powerhouse of Macau.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.300]   And so they put this team together of 25 of the best footballing school boys in Hong Kong.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.000]   And I was pretty proud to be selected for this team.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.100]   I wasn't quite sure why I was selected, but I was pretty proud.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.700]   I was playing pretty good football for South Island School, the school that I was at at the time.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.000]   And I was selected.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.800]   So I showed up to that very first practice.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.600]   And you know what that would be like, right?
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.900]   You're selected, but you don't know any of the other boys that have been selected.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.100]   And you're standing there.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.100]   And in that first practice, there's a lot of nerves.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.300]   There's some excitement, right?
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.600]   You're excited. You're going to play together.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.400]   But there's nerves. And you're all checking each other out.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.800]   Like, who's the best player in the team, right?
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.600]   Well, after about half an hour, it was pretty obvious to myself and to the coaches
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.900]   that I was the worst player in the team.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.800]   The worst player out of the 24 players.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.700]   I was terrible.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.000]   In fact, the standard of all the other guys was so much higher than me
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.200]   that I was wondering why was I selected in the first place.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.800]   And I began to understand that it was because I'm actually a left-footed player.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.300]   And I like to play in the left back of defense.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.400]   Nobody likes to play on the left back of defense.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.800]   And I'm a left-foot player who plays in the left back of defense.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.300]   In other words, they were desperate to find somebody in the position that I played in.
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   And so they selected me to play in that position.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.800]   It was pretty dire that I was as bad as I was compared to everybody else.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.600]   On the night before the tournament, it was clear to me that I was not going to play any game whatsoever.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.300]   And this was just illustrated even more that during that night
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.400]   where they were discussing strategy for how they were going to beat all these teams,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.100]   they also had some fun in coming up with awards for the team.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.400]   I was voted the least likely to score.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   Which I understand because you actually have to play to score, right?
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.300]   And I knew I was not going to play.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.500]   So I was voted least likely to score.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.300]   The expectation of the team was that even if I could get some time on the pitch
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.400]   and the ball came towards me and the goal was open and there was no one around,
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.700]   I would still fluff the shot and miss.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.000]   Well, we got thrashed by China, by Indonesia, and by the Philippines.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.700]   And then came Macau.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.700]   If there was one team that we thought we could beat, it was Macau.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.900]   Since when did they play good football in Macau?
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.300]   So our coach, wanting to salvage some pride, selected the best team he had against Macau.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.400]   We had not scored a goal the whole tournament, right?
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.100]   And he wanted to right those wrongs.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.600]   So he had the best team.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.000]   I didn't even qualify for the best 24.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.100]   So here's the thing.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.700]   Although I was in the squad that day and I had the squad outfit on
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.800]   and I had my boots on and everything like that,
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.600]   I wasn't even on the bench.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.500]   There was no room for me on the bench.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   I was in the stands with the fans.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.900]   That's where I was.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.300]   True story.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.300]   My mom was so upset.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.100]   By halftime against Macau, it's nil-nil.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.300]   Nothing's happened.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.100]   At the beginning of the second half, our star left midfielder is brought down
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.700]   by a horrendous tackle by his counterpart from Macau.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.200]   I mean, it was such a bad tackle.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.600]   And the team of physios came on the field.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.700]   They put him on a stretcher.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.500]   They carried him off.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.800]   And the coach suddenly realized he needed to replace him with a left-footed player.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.200]   He desperately searched the bench for a left-footed player and did not find one.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:27.800]   And so with the slowest head turn I have ever seen, he looked desperately to the stands.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.100]   His eyes caught my eyes.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.700]   And I'm sitting forward there like this, right?
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:39.400]   He keeps looking past me as if he was going to pull a fan out of the stands to come play.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.000]   His eyes eventually come back to me.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And with the most reluctant hand signal I have ever seen, he calls me up for my international football debut.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.200]   I run onto the pitch so fast because I'm so excited.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.900]   I run all the way to the center circle before I realize that I'm actually playing left in midfield.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.900]   So I run back to the left-hand side of the pitch.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.300]   This is not going well.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.300]   The game starts again.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.500]   It is fast-paced and furious.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.200]   But we're actually doing okay.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   And at one moment, about 10 minutes in, we break down the right-hand side of the pitch.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.100]   The whole team surges forward.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.300]   I go along with everybody else, not really knowing what I'm doing.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.500]   I end up in the outside of the left-hand corner of the box.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:35.400]   Our right-foot, right-hand midfielder crosses the ball in, and the whole stadium pauses.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.100]   Now, it was about the worst cross you've ever seen in your life.
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.500]   It was a terrible cross.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.300]   And as soon as the guy kicked it, we all knew that none of us were going to get it, that
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.200]   the goalkeeper was going to come out and very easily grab a hold of it.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.400]   Well, sure enough, the ball is coming in from the right-hand side.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.600]   The goalkeeper comes out to grab it.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.300]   And I guess he had a brain fart because he totally misses the ball, like totally misses it.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.000]   And because everybody else is so surprised because they were guaranteed that the goalkeeper
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.600]   was going to get it, when he missed it, all the other players missed it too.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.500]   And the ball came, and it landed right in front of me.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.400]   I was so scared.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.400]   I was scared that the football was going to hit me in the face.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.800]   It was going to bounce off the ground and smack me in the face.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   So here's what I did, okay?
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.200]   I was so scared, I wanted to protect myself.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.700]   I went, "Ahh!"
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.500]   Just like that.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.200]   I kid you not.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.000]   I'll do it again.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.400]   "Ahh!"
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:42.900]   My right foot magically connected at exactly the right moment as the ball bounced.
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.700]   It was the best half-volley you had ever seen in your life.
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:54.300]   Even though I was trying to avoid pain, the ball flew off my right foot and like a lightning bolt,
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.100]   steamed into the top right-hand corner of the net.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.500]   Yes!
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:05.200]   Yes!
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.900]   I scored!
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.700]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.400]   I scored!
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.500]   Even though I was like, "Yeah!"
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.100]   It was amazing.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.500]   All my teammates came around me.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.100]   "Oh my God!"
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.400]   And here's what they were saying, "Oh my God!
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.400]   You scored!
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:15.900]   You scored!
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.900]   It was you!
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.200]   It was you!"
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:28.700]   The one voted least likely to score, defied expectations, scored the winning goal,
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.400]   the only goal we ever scored in the whole tournament,
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.000]   and we beat Macau!
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.200]   Come on!
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.000]   All right.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.800]   Yes, yes.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.300]   I'm in the flesh right here with you.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.900]   I'll sign anything after the service, anything at all.
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.400]   I will sign it.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:56.700]   As we start 2023, I wonder what expectations you have for the year ahead.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:03.900]   I wonder what expectations you have for yourself personally, for your work, your career,
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.200]   for your relationships, people in your life.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.700]   I wonder what your expectations are even for God, for what He might do in your life this year,
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.600]   for how He might work in you and around you.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.200]   I wonder where your expectations are as you start this new year.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.500]   Because here's the reality, every single one of us, we always have expectations.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.800]   In fact, our expectations shape and form everything that we think and we do.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.900]   And most of the expectations we carry, formed by years and years of past experience,
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.400]   actually sit in our subconscious, and we don't even realize that they are there,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.100]   and we don't consciously engage with our expectations when we go about our lives.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.900]   I'll give you an example.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.300]   When you came into the auditorium today and you found a chair,
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.600]   you actually sat down in that chair with the subconscious expectation
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.900]   that the chair would not collapse.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.300]   You just, because of your past experience, have always sat in a chair that looks like this.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.800]   It looks like it's going to hold your weight.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.000]   You don't even think about it.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.700]   You sit down.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.500]   Lo and behold, the chair holds your weight.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.600]   It confirms that subconscious expectation, and you continue with your life.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.900]   Your expectations shape everything that you do.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.700]   Are you with me?
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.200]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:25.000]   What expectations have shaped how you feel about 2023?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   For some of us in this room, you've had a really tough 2022.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.800]   It's been really hard, really difficult.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.000]   There's been some tough stuff going on in your life.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.700]   There's been some struggle and some hardship and some suffering, perhaps.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.100]   Maybe you've made some mistakes that you're not proud of and you're still wrestling with.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:45.000]   And your experiences of 2022 have now shaped an expectation in you
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   that 2023 is probably going to be a little bit of the same.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.700]   It's probably not going to be the best year ahead.
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.100]   It's probably not going to be great.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.800]   You're probably not that excited about it.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.900]   You're thinking, "Well, it was really tough '22.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.500]   I'm kind of bringing a lot of that tough.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.800]   I'm exhausted.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   I just don't think this is going to be so great.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.100]   I can't wait for 2024.
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.400]   Maybe that'll be better," right?
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.700]   If you've had a tough 2022, no doubt your expectations for 2023 will come alongside that.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.100]   And it's the same if you had a great 2022.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.600]   Some of you in this room had the best 2022 of your life.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.700]   You had an amazing year.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.600]   Your career went well.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.700]   Things went great.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.400]   You did some things that weren't expected.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.300]   You actually achieved more than you had thought.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.800]   And so as you lean into 2023, those things have shaped your expectations,
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   and you're excited about 2023.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.700]   You're excited about it.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.900]   You're hoping it's going to be great.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.800]   "Well, it was great before.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   It's going to be great again."
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.100]   There's no reason to feel any other differently.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.500]   And so here is the sobering reality when we step into a new year.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.100]   It is not your New Year's resolutions that are going to shape your life.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.900]   It is not your five-year plan that ultimately is going to shape who you are.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.300]   It's not going to be the goals you've set yourself to lose a bit of fat,
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.900]   to get fit for the new year.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.000]   It's not those things that are ultimately going to shape your 2023.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.900]   Here's what's going to shape your 2023, the expectations you're holding right now.
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.500]   Those are going to be the things that are going to either set up this year for success
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.400]   for you or not.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.900]   And here's the reality.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:16.300]   So often, our expectations keep us on the bench when we should be playing on the pitch.
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:23.700]   So often, your expectations will hold you back rather than release you into what it might be
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.300]   that God wants you to experience.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.800]   As I was praying for us as a church about two months ago,
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.500]   as I was thinking about what 2023 might be like for us,
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.400]   it was this idea of expectations that I felt God put on my heart.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:45.600]   This idea of challenging you in your thought process around the expectations that you hold.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.200]   And as I was praying for you, I felt a funny emotion.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.400]   It was this strong emotion of excitement and exhilaration in my heart.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.800]   Like, literally, like, I am so excited for what this year is going to be ahead for you.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.200]   I am so excited, and I feel it in my spirit as we're doing our services today,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.100]   as I'm standing here with you right now.
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.700]   I feel this sense of exhilaration about how amazing stuff is going to be this year.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:16.300]   And the reason why I feel that way is because in critical moments of history,
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.800]   and if we're honest with ourselves, Hong Kong is in a critical moment of its history.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.900]   God always comes and does something new.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.300]   I mean, if you look through Scripture, you'll see that in critical moments of history,
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.700]   God always steps in and He does something new,
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.900]   something that He's never done before, something that shapes God's people for something in their future.
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.900]   And I feel and sense as I was praying for this year that this is the year for Hong Kong.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:48.200]   God is about to do something new in our city, something of hope, something of life,
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.900]   something of positivity, something that's going to grow and change and bring this place much hope and joy.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.200]   God has it on His heart because this is His character.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.700]   He wants to step into the hard moments, step into the difficult times,
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:12.300]   and do something so profound, so unexpected, so new that the world shifts on its axis.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.800]   And if you're anything like me, there might be something in your heart that's saying,
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:23.000]   "God, I need the new. I desire this new thing to come to shape and to form in me.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:32.800]   I want to experience what that would be like, God, for you to come and do something like you have never done before."
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:39.400]   In the Bible, when it describes this word new in the Greek version of the Old Testament and the New Testament,
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.700]   there are two Greek words for new, "neos" and "kainos."
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:50.100]   Neos means something new from something that is old.
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:56.000]   Kainos means something completely brand new that's never existed before.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.900]   So there are two emphases when you read Scripture and you see the word new.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.900]   It could be one of those two words, either just something new from something old,
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.400]   something that's being created out of something before,
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.900]   or kainos, new, something that has never been created, never happened before.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.800]   It's a completely brand new thing.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.000]   And as I was praying for us, I felt like God was saying,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.600]   "I'm about to release this kainos kind of work over the people of the vine,
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:29.800]   and I got so excited for you because God is about to do something in you that he's never done before."
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:41.500]   And the challenge is, as we start the new year, do we expect it or not?
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:47.300]   Let me show you a passage of Scripture that I think is so relevant for this time of history that Hong Kong is in,
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.500]   and so relevant for us as we lean into this thought of God doing something new.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.100]   It's from Isaiah chapter 43, and it's just a few verses.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.000]   Let me read this to us.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   This is what the Lord says,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   "He who has made a way through the sea, a path through the mighty waters,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.100]   who drew out the chariots and the horses, the army and the reinforcements together,
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:14.100]   and there laid them, never to rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a wick,
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.900]   forget the former things.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.400]   Do not dwell on the past.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.300]   See, I'm doing a new thing.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.000]   Now it springs up.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.600]   Do you not perceive it?
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.600]   I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.800]   The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls,
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:39.300]   because I provide water in the desert and streams in the wasteland to give drink to my people,
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.300]   my chosen people, the ones that I'd formed for myself,
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.500]   so that they may proclaim my praise."
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:52.300]   God uses Isaiah to show up in a critical moment of Israel's history and say,
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.900]   "Wake up, Israel, because I'm doing something new."
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:02.700]   It won't surprise you that the word "new" there in the Greek version of the Old Testament
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.500]   is "kainos", a brand new thing.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.300]   Now, context is so important here,
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.700]   because when Isaiah brings this prophetic word,
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.300]   it's at a moment of great difficulty for Israel.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:20.000]   They've been at this point about 70 years in captivity in Babylon.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   The Babylonian army had stormed into Jerusalem 70 years before,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.800]   destroyed their walls, destroyed their temple, killed many of them,
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.700]   and a remnant of Israel had been brought back to captivity in Babylon.
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.900]   And for 70 years, they've been there in captivity.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:41.600]   For 70 years, they've had a theological crisis whilst they've been in isolation.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.800]   And isolation has created a theological crisis in them.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.200]   Where is God? What is he doing? Is he going to show up?
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.100]   Will things ever be like they will be again?
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:57.100]   And in the midst of that brokenness, God shows up.
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.400]   And if you're anything like me,
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.100]   when I think about the context of Isaiah chapters 40 to 66,
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.500]   that's the chapters where God begins to speak this hope into Israel
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.000]   in a really difficult time for them.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.900]   When I think about that context, I think about us.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.900]   I think about how relevant this is for us here in Hong Kong.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.900]   We know that the last number of years have been super hard here.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.400]   We know that because of COVID,
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.200]   we've been in a season of isolation from one another,
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.400]   just like Israel was in a season of isolation from their homeland.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.600]   We know that just like Israel had been whittled from the 12 tribes
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.000]   right down to like a remnant remaining,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   we know that many people have left Hong Kong in the last year or two.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.600]   We know that it almost feels like there's a remnant of us left in the city now,
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.100]   wondering and hoping for what's ahead.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:49.200]   And just like that, there's been a theological crisis for many of us during COVID.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.100]   When churches were shut down and the doors of the churches weren't open,
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.000]   so many of us struggled with our faith.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.400]   We're in isolation.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.600]   Where is God?
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.100]   When will things get back to how they were before?
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.800]   Everything we felt in the last year or two is exactly how Israel was feeling
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.700]   when they're in this time of captivity and God breaks into that time
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.900]   and he says, "Forget the former things.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.400]   Do not dwell on the past.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.600]   See, I'm doing a new thing.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:22.400]   See, I'm doing a kainos thing, a new thing that I've never done before."
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.700]   And the question we should ask is,
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:29.000]   what was that new thing that God was about to do for Israel that he had never done before?
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   You want to know what it is?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.700]   Jesus.
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.300]   It was the Messiah.
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:40.700]   This is the starting point of Israel's journey to encountering the hope in their spirit
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.700]   for a coming Messiah who would right the world's wrongs.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.800]   It begins right here by God saying, "I'm doing a new thing amongst you,
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.100]   one that is kainos, not ever before thought of.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.300]   It's not a new thing from an old thing.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.300]   This is a brand new thought, a brand new day, a brand new moment,
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.100]   and I'm doing it amongst you.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.700]   Jesus is going to come."
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.100]   Although Isaiah doesn't specifically say it here,
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.700]   we know from history that this is the turning point for Israel
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.300]   where they begin to believe that a Messiah might come
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.900]   who could save them from the pain of the world.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:21.000]   That's this moment, a new thing.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.200]   And God says this to them.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:29.000]   What a challenge. He says, "Do you not perceive it?"
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.700]   Do you not perceive it?
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.700]   He says to Israel, "I'm doing a new thing."
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.000]   He doesn't say, "I'm going to do a new thing."
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.800]   He doesn't say, "Hey, wait, in a couple of months' time, I'm going to do this amazing thing."
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.600]   He's like, "Right now, I'm doing a new thing.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.100]   I've already started the journey of that new thing.
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.700]   I've already brought birth into the world, the spirit and the idea,
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.700]   and what I'm about to do that is going to come out in the flesh so many years later.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.900]   But I've begun that process now.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.500]   Do you not perceive it?"
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:02.300]   Which has an implication in it, you aren't seeing it.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.400]   And I want to declare over you in a prophetic way at the start of this year,
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.900]   God is also doing a new thing in Hong Kong.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.800]   In a critical time of our history, I believe He's doing a new thing,
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.100]   a thing He's never done before.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.700]   And I want to say this, He's doing it in your life as well.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.700]   There is a new thing God is doing around you.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:29.100]   And I wonder whether we are ever at danger of not perceiving the new thing God is doing,
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.100]   and therefore relying on the old thing He's done before.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:38.300]   My heart for you, as you step into 2023,
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:45.400]   is that your relationship with Jesus will be so fresh, so new, so exciting, so overwhelming,
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.700]   that you could not even have a framework for it before.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:55.000]   That could help describe to you right in this moment what is about to happen to you.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.800]   He is doing a new thing.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.500]   Do you not perceive it?
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   This is why He starts with, "See, I'm doing a new thing."
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.400]   He's not saying, He's not like a magician going, "See, I'm doing a new thing."
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   You know, that's not what He's saying.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.200]   He's saying this, "See, I'm doing a new thing."
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   So see, I'm doing a new thing.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.500]   So open your eyes and see it.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.600]   I'm doing this new thing.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.200]   Can you not perceive it?
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.600]   See it.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.900]   I'm doing a new thing amongst you.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.500]   And the excitement of this is for Israel to go,
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.500]   "Are we seeing? Are we perceiving? Are we connecting with this?"
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.000]   And as we start 2023,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.200]   there are new things that are happening in and around your life that God is doing.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.800]   And your question is, "Am I failing to see the new?
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.700]   Am I positioned at the start of this year to see the new thing God is doing or not?"
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.400]   And I want to offer to you two things
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.700]   that will stop you perceiving the new thing God is going to do in your life.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.400]   Is that helpful?
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.800]   Are you still around?
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.600]   Hello, church.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.100]   I'm going to give you two things that will stop you perceiving the new.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.300]   There are many things, but here are two.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.000]   The first is you look in the wrong place.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.900]   You look for the new thing God is going to do in the wrong place.
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.600]   Let me explain that.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:25.000]   At the start of every new year, what is the thing that we talk about the most?
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.500]   What new thing are you doing this year?
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.400]   Hey, you look like you could lose some weight.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.100]   Are you doing a fast this year?
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.800]   New body? New job? New goals?
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.400]   Have you set your new goals for the year?
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.000]   What's your new word for the year?
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.900]   Has God given you your new word yet for the year?
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.800]   So often when we're looking for the new thing that God is doing,
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.200]   we actually really just have the language about the new things we're doing.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.900]   We actually end up looking at the new changes,
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.500]   the things that we think we need to change in us,
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.500]   and we kind of attribute that to what God is doing.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.300]   God does not show up to Israel here and say,
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.400]   "Behold, you're doing a new thing.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.200]   Time to fast. Woo-hoo! Right?
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.900]   Time to get the better body, the better job, the better bank account.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.300]   It's your time," God is saying.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.100]   That's not what He's saying at all to Israel.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.800]   At a critical moment in their history,
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.200]   He doesn't turn to them and challenge them to do new things.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.900]   He says, "I'm the one doing the new thing."
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.500]   That's not your role.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.400]   And there's nothing wrong with news resolutions.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.400]   There's nothing wrong with goals or five-year plans.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.900]   There's nothing wrong with a better body.
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.700]   All of that might be excellent in your life,
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.900]   might really help to serve your life.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.400]   But your hope, your salvation,
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:41.000]   what God is doing in this world is not started by you setting some good new goals.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.300]   God is already at work doing the new.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.200]   It's God's work, not yours.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.400]   Our role is not to create something new in the new year.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.700]   God's role is to create something new.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.800]   Our role is to discover it.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.700]   Our role is to perceive it.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.300]   And in perceiving it, embracing it for ourselves.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.800]   You want to change tremendously this year?
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.900]   You want the best year for your life?
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.200]   Work out what God is doing in this world.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.300]   Work out what He's doing in Hong Kong.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.700]   Work out what He's doing in and around your life.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.300]   And magnify that, embrace that, receive that.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.700]   Open your eyes to it.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.500]   The best way we change is not by trying to get some better habits in our life,
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.900]   as good as those might be.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.300]   The best way we change is by going,
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:37.700]   "God is doing this. What does that mean for this?"
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.800]   Are you with me?
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.000]   One of the reasons why we miss out on the new thing
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   is because we're looking in the wrong place.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.800]   So often, we miss out on the very new thing that God wants to do in and around our lives
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:57.100]   because we are so busy trying to create that new thing ourselves.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.900]   And for some of you, that's a word in season right at the start of this year.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.300]   He's saying, "Stop trying so hard.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:09.800]   Stop trying to create in you the new thing that I can only create,
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.100]   that I can only do.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.900]   I'm doing a new thing.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.700]   Open your eyes."
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.300]   Here's the second thing that will stop us from perceiving the new thing.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.700]   And it's why I started the message with my funny story about football.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.900]   It's expectations.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.200]   Your expectations will often stop you
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.300]   from seeing the very things that God is doing in your life.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:40.100]   This is actually the reason that God draws attention to in this passage.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.800]   I want to show you this from verse 16.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.900]   Let me read this to us again.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.300]   Is everybody still okay?
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.300]   Is this helping anyone?
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.700]   Good. Over here on the left. I like it.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.500]   Left. See, left-footed, left side. Good.
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.900]   This is what the Lord says.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.800]   "He who made a way through the sea, a path through the mighty waters,
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.500]   who drew out the chariots and the horses and the army and the reinforcements together
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:05.700]   and lay them there, never to rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a wick,
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.200]   forget the former things, do not dwell on the past.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.500]   See, I'm doing a new thing."
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   It blows my mind what God does here.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:19.500]   He goes right back to a very fundamental time in Israel's history.
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.000]   Right before he says, "I'm doing a new thing,"
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.900]   God describes an old thing He has done.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.600]   Not just an old thing, but the greatest old thing He's ever done for them.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.900]   He says, "To he who has made a way through the sea."
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.400]   What is He talking about there?
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   Come on, everybody.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.900]   What's He talking about?
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.100]   I heard it over here.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.600]   Red Sea. Exodus, right?
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.700]   He's going back to the most fundamental moment
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.700]   that actually defines the modern nation of Israel.
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.700]   That moment where God passed the Red Sea,
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:55.100]   Israel was able to get through, the evading Egyptian army follows after them,
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.900]   the seas come back, all the chariots get messed up,
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.400]   they get snuffed out, never to appear again, as it says right here.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:06.700]   God takes them back to the greatest moment of His activity ever that He's ever done in life.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.900]   In fact, it is the greatest miracle that He's ever done
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.400]   that shaped and molded Israel as the nation itself.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.600]   And then He says, "Forget the former things."
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.100]   Do not dwell on the past.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.500]   Hang on a sec.
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.600]   Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a sec.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.100]   It's like God is saying, "Hey, do you remember the most amazing thing I've ever done in your life?
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.900]   The thing that totally changed your life?
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.400]   The thing that made you the best person that you've ever been?
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   You remember that moment?
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.900]   Remember when I split the Red Sea and you guys remember that?
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.300]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.700]   I want you to forget about it.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.700]   I don't want you to think about it anymore.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.000]   I want you to let it go.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.900]   Why?
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:49.700]   Because that moment in your past is blinding you to the new thing I'm about to do.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.500]   Even the really good thing in your past is blinding you to the new reality.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.200]   Because guess what? I'm doing a kynos work.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.500]   It means it's never existed before.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.700]   It means that your expectations in the past won't actually help you in what I'm about to do.
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.200]   It'll only blind you.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:12.900]   You'll only be holding on to the God who parts the seas when I'm about to be a God who becomes a human in flesh.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.400]   You never expected that.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.000]   You never thought that was going to happen.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.700]   So let go of the former things, even the great stuff,
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:26.000]   because it's creating a box that you've put me in and I'm about to break that box.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.200]   And if you think I'm just a God who parts the seas, as great as that is,
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.700]   you're not ready for the God who's about to act.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.800]   Paul, in a different way, says it like this.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:45.700]   Our God is able to do immeasurably more than I could ever ask or imagine.
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.900]   See, the new thing God wants to do in your life is immeasurably more than you could ever ask or imagine.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:55.700]   The new thing he wants to do in our city is immeasurably more than we could ever ask or imagine.
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:02.700]   And we are so boxed in by all the things that have happened before,
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:09.700]   when God wants to free us so we can see again.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.800]   Now, it's easy, isn't it?
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.700]   In fact, it sounds great when I tell you, "Hey, let go of the bad stuff."
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:21.300]   You know, we read a passage like this, "Hey, forget the former things. Do not dwell on the past."
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:25.700]   We're like, "Oh, thank you, Jesus, man. Yeah, because I made some messed up things in the past.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.500]   I did some things that were wrong. I did some things that were bad, man.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:33.200]   I feel so bad and so guilty. Oh, but I step into the new year, and you're telling me to let go.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.400]   Oh, yeah. Happy. See you later."
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.500]   Are you with me?
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:41.300]   Like when we hear, "Let go of the past," it fills a great word for us
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:45.300]   because all the stuff that is bad in us, all the stuff that we suffered from,
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.600]   yeah, let's let those things go.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.200]   That's not what God says here.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.100]   He takes them back to the most amazing thing he's done,
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.700]   and he's saying, "Let go of that thing because that's only going to put you in a box.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.200]   It's only going to create a way in which you're going to see the world that is not actually what I want."
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:06.600]   You see, God didn't want Israel's previous expectations of his actions in the world
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.500]   to be their ceiling but their floor.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.700]   Are you with me, church?
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.700]   He didn't want it to be their ceiling, the thing that they're always hutting up against.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.300]   "Oh, he did that in the past, so let's hope he does that again."
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.200]   And God's like, "I don't want to do that again.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.500]   I did that before. It was important before.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.900]   I've got a new thing. I'm doing a new thing.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:33.400]   It's a kynos thing. Stop hoping for neos when I have kynos for you."
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.100]   Two days before Christmas, my iPhone brought up a photo history moment.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.600]   Did you get those?
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.700]   Really annoying, right?
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.400]   You turn on your phone, and there's like a photo there from the past,
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.400]   and it's like when you had really bad hair.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.700]   Five years ago, you had bad hair, you know, like something like that, right?
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:58.000]   So, two days before Christmas, my phone jumps up a photo of Christmas Day at the Vine 2018.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.300]   And stupidly, I clicked on it.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:07.100]   And I was taken to a folder of all the photos and videos I'd made on Christmas Day 2018.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.500]   Let me tell you about that day.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.600]   This place was packed.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.500]   There was not an empty seat in the auditorium.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:22.900]   I watched those videos with a sense of, "Man, God was awesome. That is so cool.
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:29.900]   Oh, I wish the Vine was still like that."
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.000]   It's funny, isn't it?
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.700]   How the great things God has done in our past can be the things that upset us in our present,
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:44.900]   can be the things that make us go, "Pfft, he doesn't do that anymore."
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.800]   I have to say, two days before Christmas, I was pretty deflated.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.000]   Who's going to show up on Christmas Day?
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Like, so many people are on holiday.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.500]   All my friends are in Niseko skiing. It's really annoying.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.200]   Like, who's going to show up, right?
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:06.300]   At our 11.30 service on Christmas Day, we had almost 900 people in one service.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:11.000]   It's the largest single service we've had in 27 years here at the Vine.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.400]   We could not, like, we didn't just run out of chairs in this room.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.800]   We ran out of places in the building for people to be.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.700]   Out right here was full.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.600]   The mini hall downstairs, full.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.300]   Right outside by the thing, Tony Reed, our former senior pastor, was texting us saying,
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.100]   "Do not let any more people in the building."
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:31.300]   I love you, Tony, but I agree, man. It was so packed.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   The single biggest moment ever.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.700]   And there's me two days before,
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.100]   looking at the great thing God has done in the past,
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.600]   and kind of going, "That's now my thing that I kind of..."
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:45.700]   And like, God is like, "You have no idea, Andrew, what I'm about to do."
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.100]   And of course, it's not about the numbers of things, the size of things.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.400]   Some of the great new things that God wants to do in you are so small
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.700]   that you're likely to miss them unless He opens your eyes.
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.000]   And so He says here through Isaiah to Isaiah,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   "Do you not perceive it?"
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.800]   Can you not see it?
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.700]   What we're going to do over the next six weeks is help you to see it.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.800]   This series is called "Will You See?"
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.400]   And I believe that there is so much that God has for you ahead.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.300]   And as we look at this here on the screen,
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.200]   I'll give you a breakdown of how we're going to go through this.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.800]   We're going to go through chapters 40 to 66 in Isaiah.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.700]   And each week, we're going to pull out a new thing that God says to them
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.600]   in that critical season of history when He turns their expectations.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.400]   And He talks about lots of different new things in those chapters.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.500]   And we're going to look at those each week here together
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:39.000]   to help you to get your mind around the new thing that God wants to do in your life.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.900]   Here's the thing.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.900]   Let go.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.200]   Let go of all the bad stuff, the hard stuff.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.400]   If you've had a tough 2022, and many of us have,
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.600]   don't allow that to set your expectations for 2023.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.200]   Let me also challenge you to even let go of the great stuff,
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.600]   the stuff that God did that was amazing.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.700]   But don't allow that for you to put God in a box
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.000]   and think that God's always going to act like that
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.100]   when God has new amazing things that are abundantly beyond anything you could ever imagine.
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:16.600]   That's your 23, and that's why I'm exhilarated for you.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.800]   Amen?
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.200]   We're going to respond by taking communion together.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.400]   I wonder whether you just take a cup with me, and the band are going to come.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   And I'm going to invite you to stand with me, actually, as we do this.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.100]   I think there's no better way to start the year
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:34.600]   and to respond to a message like this than to take a moment
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:41.800]   with a symbol of coming around Christ in his life, death, and resurrection.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.600]   So I wonder whether you just peel back the first layer,
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:52.100]   take the little paper, I don't know what it is, cardboard thing, whatever, in your hand.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.500]   It's not cardboard. It's edible. Don't worry.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.100]   Don't eat it yet. Don't eat it yet.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:01.500]   I wonder whether you just close your eyes as you're holding this.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:06.700]   What you're holding in your hand is a symbol of the life of Christ, his body broken for you.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:17.400]   And as you start 2023, this represents the incredible things that he has done for you in the past.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.900]   When his body was broken on that cross, he had given his life for his disciples
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.500]   and for those in the first century.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:32.000]   And he gave up his life, his body, after having done all these miracles,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.900]   all this teaching, all this incredible stuff,
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:41.200]   so that they would come to know a resurrection that was unlike anything that they had expected.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.100]   What you're holding in your hands this morning is a symbol of the greatest thing
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.700]   that Christ has ever done for you.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.700]   It might be when you came to know him.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.900]   It might be your baptism.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:57.900]   It might be the person he's brought into your life, a spouse or a relationship.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:02.500]   It might be that moment when you prayed for someone who was sick and they got well.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.500]   It might be a miracle that he's done for you.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:10.900]   And just like with the bread, our place with the bread is gratitude.
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.300]   Thank you, Lord, for your body broken for me.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:18.700]   So today it is that great thing he's done for us in the past.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.300]   I want you to bring that to mind for you.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.900]   And as you bring it to mind for you, I want you to thank him for that incredible thing.
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.700]   Maybe it's a whole list of things.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:34.900]   Maybe it's for your family, relationships in your life, whatever.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:41.900]   And that great thing is to be now your floor, not your ceiling.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:47.100]   That great thing is not to be a box that you've put God in.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:56.700]   And as we take the bread together today, we do so with this idea of allowing ourselves not to dwell
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.100]   on the things that God has done in the past that are so great,
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.100]   but actually allow ourselves to be open to the new.
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:10.900]   I want to take the bread with me together.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:15.700]   Then you want to peel back the next layer of your cup.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:21.700]   And then we're going to just hold that for a moment again with our eyes closed before we take it.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:26.100]   So once you've peeled it back, just close your eyes again.
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:32.500]   Christ is with us here in this moment, and it's such a precious gift.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.700]   The blood of Jesus represents forgiveness of sin.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:41.100]   What a gift it is for us at the beginning of this new year to take the cups
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:45.300]   in that place of remembering our brokenness and difficulties.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.100]   And just as we've thought about the greatest things that God has done,
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:53.300]   I want you now to take a moment just to bring before Christ some of the things that you're not so proud of.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.500]   Maybe the Holy Spirit is just speaking to you now.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.300]   Maybe it's just some sins that you want to bring to Him and confess before Him.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.700]   Maybe there's just something that's there that, yeah, you know that.
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:08.500]   Maybe it's just something you haven't done this year, a relationship that broke down,
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.100]   something that happened at work.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:17.100]   Maybe it was your fault, maybe it wasn't, but it was really difficult for you and really hard.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:22.700]   The blood of Jesus covers everything that we do that we're not proud of.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:26.300]   Everything that has happened to us, whether we've caused it or it's just happened to us,
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:31.900]   that has been difficult and hard. The blood of Christ releases us from this.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:36.500]   The glory of the cross and the resurrection is that blood paid the price for our sins
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:41.300]   so that we are not punished by God, but we receive new eternal life.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:47.900]   So just as Isaiah says to his people, "Forget the former things, even the hard things."
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:53.300]   I don't want you as your pastor for you to carry any of that brokenness, any of that sin into the new year.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.300]   And right here we have an opportunity just to confess it before Christ.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.700]   The Bible says just to take a moment to do this.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:06.100]   If there's anything that we have against one another, we ought to confess those things before we take the cup.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:11.100]   So I want you just to take a moment just in your heart to bring anything before Him.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:17.300]   Ask for His forgiveness and His grace. He loves you so much. He's not angry at you. He's not upset at you.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:24.300]   He's so excited about your future. Just bring Him that now.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:32.300]   And now let's take in the cup together in the forgiveness of Christ Jesus.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.100]   I wonder whether you just open your hands with me as we're going to respond just in a moment in worship.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:43.500]   But as your hands are open, the Holy Spirit just wants to come and continue to minister to you here at the start of the new year.
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.500]   You don't need to rush from this place. You don't need to rush from this moment.
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   Just allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you now.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:55.300]   He's got such great things ahead. The kynos for you, the brand new.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:01.500]   And maybe your prayer as we worship now is just to say, "Lord, open my eyes. Open my eyes.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:07.500]   Shift my expectations so that I can truly see what it is that you are doing."
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.500]   Let's worship together.
