[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]   it will change us, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.180]   - Amen.
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.520]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Good morning.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.860]   - How y'all doing?
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.080]   One more.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.880]   That was very convincing.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.420]   Well, hey, listen, I wanna talk about
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.840]   the elephant in the room.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.000]   I cut my hair.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.720]   We've noticed, yeah, we've noticed.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.380]   And in this hair-cutting adventure,
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.080]   I've heard some rumors.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.440]   So we're gonna address the rumors today.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.200]   There have been some speculation
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.360]   as to why I cut my hair,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.180]   and I wanna make sure, before I dive into God's word,
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.980]   that I am up front with you and we clear the air.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.940]   So the first rumor is that it was a wig.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.000]   Y'all, listen, this was real hair.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.280]   It took me four to five years to grow it, okay?
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.980]   I've got pictures of the whole journey.
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.160]   They were natural dreads.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160]   They were beautiful, but I did cut them.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.940]   So they were real, not a wig.
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.640]   Second rumor, this one tickles me,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.360]   was that I'm going through a midlife crisis, y'all.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.200]   Come on.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.840]   I'm younger than Allison, right?
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.400]   Like, come on.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.920]   I'm still like vibrant, you know, I'm 34.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.160]   I've got so much left ahead of me.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.400]   So no, I did not cut my hair
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.360]   'cause I'm going through a midlife crisis,
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.960]   and my hair is real.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.080]   There's not been a wig, but maybe it's not a bad idea
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.560]   if I wanna bring it back.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.960]   Okay, Emma says no, whatever.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.100]   Let me explain to you the reason I cut my hair,
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.600]   because it's, you know, just so you know,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.600]   'cause I think once we know that,
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.720]   we can stop worrying about that
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.680]   and actually focus on God's word.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.200]   My wife and I had a daughter back in June this past year,
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200]   little Remy, and I love being a dad.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.520]   This is my second kid.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.680]   My first one's Elias, the perfect little boy,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.480]   and I have the perfect little girl, Remy.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.480]   And I am about 99,000% convinced
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.620]   that my daughter thought my dreads were her father.
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.240]   Let me explain this to you.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.560]   So I, you know, her being tiny and a baby,
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.840]   you know, I look over her when I see her,
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.520]   and every time I would see her, I would talk to her,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.360]   and I would be animated, and I would smile.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.520]   We'd be making eye contact,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.000]   and I realized at some point
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.680]   that actually I'm making eye contact with her,
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.680]   but she's looking a little higher.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.960]   And so I would like swing my dreads
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.120]   and just watch her eyes go there,
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.160]   and I'd like move over here,
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.320]   and my dreads were quite long.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.040]   And I realized she loved my dreads.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.200]   She thought her father were these beautiful dreadlocks
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.360]   that I had, and I refuse to let anything
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.000]   come between me and my daughter.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.280]   So I cut 'em, and that's the story.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.960]   So they're gone, they're not coming back.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.600]   Remy now makes, someone asked me this
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.960]   after the first service, they're like,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.760]   "But does she actually make eye contact with you?"
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.600]   Yes, she does.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.000]   She does make eye contact with me,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.480]   and all is well again in the Armstrong household.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.160]   But all three of us, my son, my wife, and I
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.640]   are adjusting to now being a family of four.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.480]   Having a little girl's been fun.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.240]   My son, he's three years old, and he is learning, man.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.160]   Like, he's never had a sibling before.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.440]   He's the oldest, so he's learning.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.040]   He's trying to figure out, how do I engage?
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.320]   He doesn't know, how do I play with a tiny little baby?
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.240]   You know, he goes to school,
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.360]   he has all the energy in the world,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.560]   and she's just like, "Man."
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.400]   So it's a bit of a journey for him.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.680]   And I realize that he's been watching me.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.080]   He's been watching me when I didn't realize
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.920]   he was watching me.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.880]   He's been learning from me, he's been spying on me.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.600]   A few weeks ago, I walked into our living room,
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.280]   and Remy's in her space, and I see, but I hear,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.840]   Elias over her little Moses basket.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.400]   He's like, "How you doing, my little girl, girl?"
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.800]   In a high-pitched voice, and he's got his nose
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.880]   next to her nose, and he's tickling her feet,
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.520]   and he's doing all my mannerisms.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.800]   And I'm like, "Yo, dude is stealing."
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.200]   First of all, "Girl, girl," that's what I say, okay?
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.000]   Kayla, my wife, is girl, 'cause she's number one,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.280]   the number one woman in my life, so she's my girl.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.640]   Remy is my second most important woman in my life,
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.360]   girl, girl, so she's my girl, girl.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.560]   Elias doesn't know this, he's three years old,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.200]   but he's referring to her as his girl, girl,
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.280]   and I'm just getting a little bit jealous and annoyed
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.080]   as a father, like, pray for me, it's a whole thing.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.280]   But I'm realizing he's catching on to the things
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.360]   that we are doing, and I'm not trying to be an example,
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.920]   he just happens to learn from me, and he's listening,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.480]   and this is slightly problematic,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.120]   because he's in school now.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.880]   And so, every so often, he takes the things
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.760]   that he hears from home to school,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.680]   so I'm already a pretty holy man, but just know,
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.280]   I am being even more holy.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.680]   When I stub my toe, I quote scripture,
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.120]   just to make sure that Elias doesn't say anything
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.320]   inappropriate, and we get emails at small world.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.520]   But I am now properly recognizing the impact
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.120]   and the example that I am to my son.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.040]   You know, my wife and I are both pretty big examples
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.920]   for him, he copies what we do, he listens when we know
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.960]   he's listening, he listens when we don't know
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.920]   he's listening, and he's repeating after us,
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.760]   and we're pretty much the biggest example in his life.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.820]   Now, he, one day, will be the biggest example
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.840]   in Remy's life, 'cause he's the oldest, right?
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.280]   Are there any firstborns here?
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.920]   Anyone who's a firstborn and have siblings?
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.040]   No, no, only children, just firstborn with siblings, right?
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.520]   So I'm the firstborn of three, right?
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.400]   My brother Jeremy is great, but not as cool,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.920]   my sister Jasmine's great, but nowhere as cool.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.080]   I'm the oldest, and I remember, growing up,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.160]   my mom, I can still hear it to this day,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.320]   my mom would be like, now be careful what you do,
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.120]   because, you know, Jeremy is watching you,
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.400]   he's looking up to you as an example.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.920]   And actually, I didn't share this in the first story,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.960]   but let me just tell you guys what kind of example
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.980]   I've been to my brother.
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.800]   So I played baseball, I'm five years older,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.200]   just so you know, there's plenty of space.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.840]   I played baseball, my brother played baseball after me.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   I started playing guitar self-taught,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.760]   Jeremy started playing guitar self-taught.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.920]   I end up marrying a white woman,
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.680]   my brother ends up marrying a white,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.920]   like he literally has copied every single thing.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.240]   I have been such an example, you guys.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.480]   It's been a good time.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.680]   Jeremy, I love you if you ever watch this, for the record.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.240]   But yeah, so the way that he operates,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.280]   my son will have to be an example at some point
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.760]   to his sister, Remy.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.680]   And examples are super helpful.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.000]   Having a guide, having someone who has gone ahead of you,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.760]   who can give you a bit of a template,
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.120]   who you can look at when things are challenging,
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.400]   is helpful, because times do get challenging for us.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.040]   Things are tricky, and sometimes we don't know the answer,
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.520]   and rather than trying to blaze the trail yourself
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.480]   to figure it out, we have templates in life.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.600]   We have examples, and as we sit in this second week
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.480]   of our forgiveness series, I wanna pretty much premise
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.680]   everything on the idea that Jesus
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.280]   was perhaps the greatest example
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.600]   of what forgiveness looks like.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.320]   If we wanna know what forgiveness looks like,
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.280]   perhaps the first step is to be like my son,
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.160]   and to watch, to analyze, to examine the things
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.880]   that Jesus did to truly be able to understand
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.480]   what forgiveness really is.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.600]   It's not something that we've created in the 21st century.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.280]   We don't have to set up how to forgive.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.240]   Actually, we have a pretty good template
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.240]   of the most powerful example of forgiveness found in Christ.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.440]   His extreme and radical forgiveness is meant to serve
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.920]   as a template to the church
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.800]   on how we ought to forgive one another.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.120]   Because forgiveness is a hard thing.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.800]   Forgiveness is not an easy thing.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.920]   I think sometimes we get the misconception
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.240]   that we should just like do it.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.040]   It's a pretty challenging thing,
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.520]   and especially if we're gonna forgive
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.160]   the way Jesus forgave.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.240]   No, we've gotta be able to see him, hear him,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.960]   examine his example to be able to draw strength
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.640]   and guidance on how to forgive.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.280]   And perhaps there's no better place
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.160]   to really set up the forgiveness of Jesus
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.600]   than with the idea of the gospel.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.560]   And the gospel is this,
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.280]   that Christ offers forgiveness to all.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.480]   To all people for all things.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.480]   He offers, he's put on the table the chance for forgiveness.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.680]   All who have sinned and have fallen short,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.720]   who's not been enough, who've messed up,
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.200]   this forgiveness ends up being the fabric of our salvation.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.680]   Ends up paving the pathway for our reconciliation.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.000]   Ends up being the foundation of our redemption.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.840]   This is powerful forgiveness.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.800]   And based off of what I've heard from this community,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.840]   we need powerful forgiveness.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.560]   When it still hurts and you still carry the hurt
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.360]   of the offense that was done to you,
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.880]   you need powerful forgiveness.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.520]   When you still have to look the other person in the eye
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.240]   who's wronged you painfully or still live in that space,
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.640]   you need powerful forgiveness.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.880]   When the words spoken over you still mark
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.880]   and direct you to today, you need a powerful forgiveness.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.600]   Not some simple stuff.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.520]   You need the powerful stuff.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.360]   And luckily enough, we have the example of Jesus
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.560]   and the kind of forgiveness he gives us
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.040]   as a template of something to look at.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.760]   When your offense cuts deep,
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.000]   you have the powerful forgiveness of Jesus as your template.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.440]   So I think it's best that we examine the gospel
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.920]   and the tenets of it because it will provide us
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.560]   both a blueprint and a guide to give us strength
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.000]   in the kind of forgiveness that we're looking into.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.800]   So the scriptures are quite clear on what the gospel is,
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.600]   but I think for most Christians,
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.920]   we don't use the word gospel every day.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.600]   Like it's just not a conversation piece.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.880]   You don't use the word gospel
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.080]   when you're talking to your friends.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.140]   And so probably for that reason,
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.960]   we don't properly understand all of what it means.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.920]   So just a way for us to understand the word gospel,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.280]   so I'm not gonna go into all the Greek around it,
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.420]   but the simple Greek translation of the word gospel
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.640]   is the phrase good news.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.720]   So rather than thinking of the gospel of Jesus
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.120]   and it just being kind of like church jargon,
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.400]   think the good news of Jesus.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.240]   Something good has happened
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.480]   and we are in response to that good news.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.800]   When we say the gospel of Jesus sets you free,
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.440]   it's the good news that he offers that sets you free.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.320]   Gospel is good news.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.840]   For the Christian, it's the gospel proclamation
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.000]   and the inauguration of the reality
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.880]   of the good news of Jesus.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.640]   And that good news is pretty clear.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.120]   It's that this, because of Jesus,
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.480]   if we now will confess our sins,
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.720]   he is faithful and he is just to forgive us of all our sins
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.920]   and he will cleanse us from all our unrighteousness.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.540]   So gospel, the good news is that we can be forgiven,
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.040]   that we can stand forgiven and are new.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.240]   And I know a lot of this probably isn't gonna be
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.480]   new information for you.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.480]   I'm not trying to teach you anything new today.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.160]   I'm hoping that as we examine the gospel,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.640]   as we remember what it is that Christ has done for us
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   and what it means to live in that gospel,
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.200]   that God will just shed light on it for us
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.400]   to properly understand what these terms are
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.680]   and what it means for us.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.480]   So we're gonna examine it closely today.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.720]   We've been forgiven.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.440]   Our sins are not just canceled, but our debt is paid.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.000]   The scales have been balanced.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.800]   God remains a God of love and of justice simultaneously.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.120]   And we have to understand the elements and the tenets
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.280]   of what this gospel means.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.640]   So in one column, you've got sin.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.000]   In the other column, we're gonna talk about
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.800]   what exactly Jesus did for us, how he actually forgives us.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.400]   And then lastly, we're gonna look at
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.600]   what does all that mean?
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.880]   What does that actually offer us?
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.600]   What are the benefits of the life, death,
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.800]   and resurrection of Jesus and what he forgives us from?
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   So when we look at sin and we understand sin,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.520]   sin ends up being one of the first major players
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.680]   in this concept of our existence.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.160]   And I think for lots of us,
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.760]   we don't fully understand what sin is.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.080]   We understand some of the fruit of sin.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.760]   We understand the things you're not supposed to do,
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.560]   but what is sin at its core?
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.920]   And I think we have to understand it
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.560]   if we're gonna have any chance of doing what Paul tells us.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.440]   He says that you should flee from sin.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.620]   Not inch away, not go to where's the line
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.120]   of what can I do, what I can't do,
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.920]   build my house here and say, oh look, I'm still good.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.640]   No, if you understand sin the way Paul understands sin,
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.120]   then you flee from it at all costs.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.840]   You run away from it.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.080]   You avoid it.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.120]   You want to remove it from your life.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.080]   So we're gonna start with understanding what sin is.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.800]   Sin tempts us.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.240]   It entices us.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.960]   Then it traps you and it entangles you.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.720]   It's meant to separate you from God,
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.280]   introducing elements like shame and guilt.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.640]   And we've all fallen susceptible to this.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.480]   Scripture would say that all have sinned
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.600]   and fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.240]   We are all guilty of this.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.720]   And when we break down what sin means,
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.320]   in our sin we end up doing this concept
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.840]   where instead of having God as the one
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.600]   in charge of our lives,
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.680]   instead of having God as the one
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.800]   who rules and reigns over all things,
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.560]   we have exchanged that and put ourselves on top of it.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.720]   Any sin you can think of,
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.000]   it has been an exchange of God for you.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.640]   We've replaced God.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.440]   In the Garden of Eden, we've chosen for ourselves
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.880]   our definition of what good and what evil is
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   versus God's definition.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.600]   And we still see that to this day.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.640]   Like we don't know what truth is anymore.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.000]   Everything is subjective.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.440]   Everything is your own truth.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.560]   Live what you think.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.640]   Live your own peace.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.520]   We've exchanged what God says is good and evil
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.840]   for our definition.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.760]   Secondly, we've exchanged the way for human flourishing.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.840]   God has a way.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.480]   He has set up a design so that all would flourish.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.400]   In sin, we have exchanged that method for our own methods.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.200]   A me first method, a me and my clan
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.080]   doing whatever I can to help myself get ahead.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.560]   We end up exchanging his method
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.200]   and it ends up hurting people,
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.440]   ends up hurting his creation.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.840]   It robs us or at least it challenges
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.160]   our understanding of our morality.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.640]   It pushes us.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.040]   We exchange God's definitions.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.320]   We exchange his way.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.920]   So boiling down sin is this,
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.720]   it's replacing God with ourselves.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.120]   It's an easy way to think of sin.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.760]   Sin is replacing God with ourselves
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.320]   where we've decided that we know better.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.800]   That our lives are too precious
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.000]   to leave into someone's hands,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.120]   so we take charge.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.680]   We do it our way because you know,
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.080]   this is me we're talking about.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.440]   This is me and my family and the things that I need.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.960]   We do whatever we can to make sure we get what we need.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.360]   The basic nature of that is what sin is.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.280]   We've filled ourselves with the things
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.720]   that are opposed with God.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.920]   We've labeled somehow these subjective things
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.840]   as the ultimate good and we find ourselves
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.040]   as a people striving after achievement
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.160]   and after earnings and we've labeled that
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.240]   as like this is the indicator.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.680]   This is the metric of what a good life looks like.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.800]   If you can earn this much,
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.120]   if you can achieve this much,
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.520]   if you can live in this house,
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.640]   if you could have this car,
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.240]   if you could marry this person,
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.120]   you've achieved but that is not God's definition
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.240]   of what a good life looks like.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.880]   In our sin we've exchanged,
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.880]   we've twisted and poisoned the good that is here.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.440]   Trying to preserve ourselves,
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.320]   trying to get ahead and the thing that we're aiming for,
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.280]   the thing that we're trying to attain
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.240]   ends up trapping us.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.000]   Ends up ensnaring us,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.440]   ends up entangling us and we find ourselves
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.080]   not actually achieving those things
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   or earning those things.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.720]   We find ourselves ultimately becoming slaves
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.800]   to those things where we work and live
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.760]   and breathe just to get ahead,
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.880]   just to make a certain milestone in a financial setting,
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.520]   just to earn a certain amount,
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.760]   just to live in a certain place,
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.080]   just to be a certain,
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.000]   that is not the reason we are here.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.760]   Genesis would tell us that when God created us,
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.600]   he had a mandate for humanity.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.880]   He had a purpose in why we would exist.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.000]   Yes, we bring him glory
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.800]   but he actually had a mission for us.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.400]   He created us and he wanted us
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.520]   to have dominion over all creation.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.600]   He had a purpose for us to reflect his image,
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.680]   to live as his image bearers,
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.320]   his representatives on earth
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.560]   and when we fall into sin,
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.880]   when we take our lives into our own hand,
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.200]   when we define what is good and what's evil for ourselves,
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.400]   we end up becoming a slave to ourselves,
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.520]   to our desires,
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.080]   we end up being controlled by creation
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.200]   and what a tragedy.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.960]   What an absolute tragedy.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.800]   We end up morally and spiritually spiraling
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.720]   while living in the consequences of poor decisions,
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.840]   dethroning God and replacing him with a lesser God
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.840]   who is subject to temptation and gives in.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.040]   Scripture would tell us that this is sin
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:45.880]   and sin has a price,
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.080]   sin has a consequence.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.880]   There is a response.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.800]   The wages of sin is death, right?
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.400]   So when we sin,
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.600]   the consequence of that is death
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.080]   and our world experiences this now.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.560]   How much sin in the world causes death?
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.800]   Causes the decay of humanity,
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.600]   causes the decay of our love for our neighbor,
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.480]   even our love for ourselves
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.120]   and it's not just a physical death
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.920]   that we are spiraling into.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.080]   There's also the eternal state
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.960]   that God has created us to be in starts to corrode
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.400]   and we find ourselves in this cosmic battle
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.840]   between God and his goodness
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:31.040]   and our sin and death.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.120]   This is sin.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.600]   This is sin and its impact is so strong
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:45.640]   but God and his goodness and his love steps in.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.280]   He interjects, he intercepts us
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.920]   as we are headed for disaster.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.600]   I normally speak pretty exaggerated and poetically
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.080]   in just all the things 'cause I'm a musician, right?
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.120]   I wanna clarify that what I'm about to say next
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.880]   is not something I came up with.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.880]   This is how Scripture defined God intercepting our sin.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:14.920]   Scripture uses very poetic, very intense and weighty words
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.840]   so that we can get a picture, a clear picture
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.400]   and understand exactly what he does.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.800]   It says that yet while we were still sinner
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.680]   and while we were still away from him,
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.800]   while we were still dead in our sin,
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.160]   God sent Christ for us.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.400]   So before we did anything right,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.720]   before you thought, oh, maybe I could be a better person,
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.920]   before you reconciled yourself
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.480]   and decided to overcome
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.840]   whatever the temptation is in your life,
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.320]   before you said sorry,
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.920]   God has sent Jesus.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.840]   This is where the gospel,
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.080]   the good news of Jesus shines into our world
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.520]   that despite all being lost and all being broken,
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.720]   Christ has come and he's not just come to erase our sins,
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.400]   he's come to forgive you and to make you new.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.720]   This is what he's aiming for.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.880]   This is what his forgiveness is meant to look like.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.760]   If we confess our sins, he is faithful.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.120]   Like we sung a minute ago,
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.640]   he is faithful and he is just to forgive us of those sins
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.040]   and cleanse us of all unrighteousness.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.240]   There is no death.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.720]   There is no death that's too low.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.760]   There is nothing you can do that is so bad
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.880]   that Christ's blood cannot cover.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.280]   This is what his forgiveness looks like.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.280]   You remember when I said that
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.800]   Christ offers us a powerful forgiveness?
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.960]   This is what I'm talking about.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.480]   That is a powerful forgiveness.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.360]   Don't we wish we knew how to live in a way
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.940]   where we could forgive others like that?
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.920]   The scripture would tell us that God loves us.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.160]   I think we know that.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.440]   God loves us.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.640]   His forgiveness is not a siloed act.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.800]   It's not just him responding
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.240]   to the fact that we made mistakes.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.560]   No, but it tells us that God's forgiveness
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.560]   is an intentional act of love.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.640]   John 3:16, perhaps the most famous passage in scripture,
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.480]   says what?
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.360]   For God so loved the world
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.520]   that he sent his son.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:15.240]   And through his son, we get the forgiveness of our sins.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   In order to forgive us, God gives us Jesus.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.480]   This is what his love looks like.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.260]   He could have outsourced it.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.880]   You know, in the scripture, you read about
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.120]   Michael the archangel or Gabriel who visits.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.960]   He could have sent one of those guys.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.680]   No, he sends Jesus.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.960]   And just to clarify, Jesus, God, same, okay?
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.800]   Same thing.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.360]   Jesus is God in flesh.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.800]   The scripture in Isaiah 7 would call him Emmanuel,
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.160]   God with us, God incarnate.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.720]   So God doesn't just send some dude named Jesus.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.960]   God puts on flesh and blood,
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.280]   and he comes still being divine, still being God,
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.560]   and he walks among broken people.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.280]   He comes and he lives with us, and he understands us.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.040]   He walks our journey.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.280]   God sends Jesus.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.360]   He ultimately sends himself.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.200]   What does that mean?
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.280]   It means this, that God made a sacrifice.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:18.600]   It means that forgiveness isn't just something you do.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.680]   Forgiveness is a sacrifice you make.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.240]   Right, 'cause in Philippians 2,
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.920]   Paul writes it super beautifully.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.120]   We understand Paul's other epistles.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.640]   We know that he would tell us to imitate him
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.640]   while he imitates Christ.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.720]   The Christian life is, you can call yourself a Christian,
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.160]   is Christ-like, we're meant to imitate Christ.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.320]   But Paul is gonna push this idea significantly further.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.000]   Don't just imitate Christ's actions.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.240]   He's gonna pull us and tell us
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.960]   that there's something even bigger,
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.160]   probably a precursor to imitating Christ's action
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.920]   that we have to understand.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.520]   He would tell us that we need to imitate
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.840]   the same mindset as Christ.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.760]   We have to think like Christ.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.240]   We have to see things like Christ.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.380]   We have to take on his mindset,
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.520]   how he approached things.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.340]   See, he took on a mindset of deep humility.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.900]   Deep humility.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.760]   Christ-like forgiveness requires this Christ-like humility.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.720]   So I'm not, I'll just read to you what Philippians 2 says
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.360]   so that you get why I'm saying this.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.760]   Philippians 2, verses eight.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.280]   Christ, who being in very nature God,
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.720]   did not consider equality with God
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.040]   something to be used to his own advantage.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.880]   Rather, instead, he made himself nothing.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.720]   Big word there.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.820]   He made himself nothing.
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.040]   Taking on the very nature of a servant.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.840]   I use the, I think the ES or the NIV on this.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.760]   I should use the ESV.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.080]   It says he made himself a slave.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.420]   Talk about humility, right?
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.400]   Taking on the very nature of a slave,
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.280]   being made in human likeness
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.400]   and being found in the appearance as a man,
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.780]   he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death,
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.220]   even death on a cross.
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.600]   This is a wild kind of humility.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.520]   Who lives this way?
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.400]   Who steps into such a radical,
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.720]   this is what God's Christ-forgiveness looks like.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.200]   This is how he forgives us.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   He is executed through a radical humility.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.360]   So you can't forgive others like Christ forgives
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.480]   without this posture of humility.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.720]   Forgiveness is not something you do
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.180]   to pat yourself on the back.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.360]   It's not something you do to show the world,
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.860]   look, I'm a bigger person, I've forgiven.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.160]   That's not what it's about.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:42.160]   Consider that forgiveness is rooted in this mindset
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.820]   and this framework and this posture of humility.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.500]   And this mark of humility is a bit of a scandal.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.180]   It's pretty challenging
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.660]   because I know there's quite a few of us,
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.100]   understandably so, who would feel
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.880]   that for the offenses done to us,
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:07.940]   our offenders deserve our anger.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.980]   They deserve our bitterness.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.100]   For what has been said to you,
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.360]   what has shaped your identity,
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.340]   they deserve some frustration.
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.760]   For how you've been treated, for how you've been hurt,
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.040]   the fact that you're still carrying this wound still
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.700]   from a close family loved one, they deserve your anger.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.560]   They deserve our frustration.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.800]   For the way they've said things and treated you
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.080]   and hurt you, we feel that others deserve,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.860]   it's only just that they get what's coming to them.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.480]   This is the natural way of thinking,
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.240]   but let me flip it on its head
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.600]   because scripture uses the word about deserving as well.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.160]   Christ would say that, the Bible would say,
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.400]   that we were once children of wrath.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.400]   We were enemies of God, deserving death.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:01.180]   We too deserve the thing.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:07.440]   We deserved death, but while we were still sinners,
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.440]   before we said sorry, before we repented,
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.280]   forgiveness is offered.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.740]   God sends himself to come and take the place
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.300]   of the things that you've done wrong,
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.920]   the consequences that you deserve,
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.720]   God sends himself to take that on.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.760]   While we were still sinners, before we get our act together,
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.360]   God substitutes, he exchanges.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.040]   Now remember, when we defined sin,
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.500]   we said that sin was this exchanging
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.720]   of who is God in your life,
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.960]   from it being God to it being you.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.080]   And in Christ's forgiveness to us,
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.320]   there is another exchange.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.800]   It's an exchange of who is guilty.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.040]   See, Christ comes in and you are supposed
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.960]   to stand guilty for the things that you've done,
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.880]   and his forgiveness offers an exchange,
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.080]   where he stands in the place of our wrongdoings,
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.440]   our shortcomings, where we failed,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.080]   where we've been on purpose,
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.560]   and where we've just not been strong enough
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.660]   to do the right thing.
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:13.680]   He takes our place, which leads us to our salvation,
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.280]   but it's done through the path of the cross
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.960]   and the blood of Jesus, which we say,
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.440]   if you grew up in church, you've heard something
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.040]   about the power of the blood of Jesus.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.560]   Nothing like the blood of Jesus,
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.640]   which kind of doesn't make sense,
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.040]   because the idea is that the blood
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.060]   is supposed to wash you clean,
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.200]   but if you put blood on something,
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.120]   it doesn't make it clean, it makes it more dirty.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.360]   So I just don't want us to be living in a world
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.520]   where we hear Christian jargon,
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.280]   we sing about it, but we don't understand it.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.440]   So I'm gonna take a few minutes
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.500]   to help us understand a little bit more,
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.320]   why do we say his blood makes us clean?
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.020]   How does his blood actually clean us?
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.920]   What does that even mean?
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.240]   Are you still tracking with me?
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.400]   We're all here?
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.920]   So in the Old Testament, for the price of sin,
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.640]   the consequence is death.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.800]   God sets up this, I don't know how you wanna call it,
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.680]   a system, a sacrificial system,
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.000]   where the place of our sin and the death
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   that we had acquired would be passed on to something else.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.340]   Something had to die in place of our sin.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.200]   So the whole sacrificial system exists.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.080]   You hear about people killing goats and sheep
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.400]   and two, was it pigeons or turtle doves or whatever it is.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.100]   They had all these animals that they had to kill,
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.040]   and the animals had to be clean.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.040]   They had to be pure, but you really can't tell
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.120]   the motives of a chicken, can you?
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.680]   That might be a little much.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.880]   So God sets up this system
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.240]   where they need to optically be pure.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.960]   That's why they said no animals with blemishes,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.120]   only the clean ones, the ones that were normally young
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.080]   and innocent to some extent.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.880]   And these optical purity, when the animal was killed,
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.080]   that blood, that sacrifice would take the place
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.320]   of the death that was upon us for our sins.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.320]   So they had a whole system around this, right?
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.420]   And in that system, you had to offer up certain animals
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.640]   for certain sins, but not every animal could cover every sin.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.720]   Not every sin could be covered,
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   and at best, what was covered was a temporary cover.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.560]   Because after all, it's a sheep for a human,
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.020]   and nowhere is that fair.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.680]   Nowhere is that just or balanced.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.600]   And so God sees this, God knows this, God understands this.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.760]   This is his temporary solution,
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.960]   while in the meanwhile, he has his plan,
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.160]   and he sends himself, he sends Jesus.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.140]   And we all know that God dies for us, right?
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.480]   Jesus dies for our sins, and we're made clean.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.580]   But I wanna look at the controversy of the fact
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.680]   that Jesus actually lived for us to be saved, right?
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.920]   So it's not just that he needed to die,
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.240]   but in order for Jesus to be clean,
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.480]   it wasn't about what he looks like.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.640]   It was about the fact that Jesus had to live a life
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.960]   of no sin.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.160]   So that's why you'll hear people in the Christian tradition
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.640]   talk about how Jesus lived a sinless life.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.680]   If he doesn't live a sinless life,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.560]   his death doesn't mean anything.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.400]   He had to be pure, he had to be clean.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.440]   So Jesus' day in and day out,
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.400]   when Jesus was thirsty and hungry in the desert,
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.840]   being tempted by Satan,
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.400]   do you know why he was saying no?
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.400]   Yes, because he was God,
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.640]   but because he was remaining clean and pure
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.480]   so that when he would die and be a sacrifice for us,
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:24.480]   our sins, all humanity's sins could be covered.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.600]   In his forgiveness, Jesus' death covers us and frees us.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:36.920]   But it's also in his forgiveness that he lives for us.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.520]   This blameless life that we get from him
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.840]   gives the blood power.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.320]   It gives, and that's why we sing and we celebrate,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.400]   and when we take communion,
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.360]   we've got the little tiny cup with juice in it, right?
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.800]   It's because the blood of Jesus has done something for us.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   He lived and he died so that we could properly be forgiven,
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.960]   so that you are no longer,
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.280]   you no longer have to be guilty for the sins that you commit.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.800]   That's the whole exchange here.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.480]   He's stepping in, he's taking the place, he's exchanging,
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.060]   and I could go on forever around this,
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.860]   but instead I wanna give us a chance to sit and think.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.260]   Normally here at the Vine,
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.140]   around, I don't know, the 30-minute mark after the service
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.200]   or the hour and 30-minute mark,
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.880]   we have a response song,
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.300]   and lots of you get up and you sprint out for lunch.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.620]   I get it, it makes sense.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.020]   We're gonna, instead of doing that,
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.540]   we're gonna sit in this.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.300]   The sermon's not done, we'll come back in a minute,
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.500]   but I want us to sit and we're gonna put up some words
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.440]   and we're gonna have a moment,
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.660]   and this moment is built around the hymn,
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.100]   How Deep the Father's Love for Us,
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.560]   which portrays, I think, flawlessly
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.480]   what the exchange looks like.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.320]   For Jesus to hang in our place,
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.600]   for Jesus to take upon himself
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.040]   the wrath of God poured out in our place,
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.520]   for Jesus to be the one who stepped in,
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.480]   and I know you're gonna be tempted to sing it
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.600]   'cause you know the melody,
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.220]   but you'll see there's no microphone here,
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.880]   there's no singer here, we're not singing right now.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.960]   I just want us to sit.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.900]   'Cause I think sometimes when we sing,
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.000]   we sing and we don't think, sometimes.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   I think when we sit and we just read,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.480]   there's a chance that this might hit you differently,
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.840]   even if you've been a Christian for 20 years.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.880]   There's a chance that you might see and remember
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:33.060]   and feel just what Jesus did for you.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.080]   So I'm gonna hand it over to Jethro.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.040]   Don't sing, take a minute and sit.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:46.080]   (gentle piano music)
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.160]   (gentle piano music)
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.240]   (gentle piano music)
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.320]   (gentle piano music)
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.400]   (gentle piano music)
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:15.480]   (gentle piano music)
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.560]   (gentle piano music)
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:43.640]   (gentle piano music)
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.800]   (gentle piano music)
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   (gentle piano music)
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   (gentle piano music)
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.960]   (gentle piano music)
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:31.960]   (gentle piano music)
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.120]   (gentle piano music)
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:45.120]   (gentle piano music)
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:56.120]   (gentle piano music)
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.280]   (gentle piano music)
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   (gentle piano music)
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.280]   (gentle piano music)
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.200]   - The cross is the most powerful expression
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:38.000]   of Christ's forgiveness for you and for me.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.320]   It was a ridiculous display of humility,
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.080]   a commitment to love,
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.960]   and ridiculous obedience.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.800]   It was our sin, it was our debt that he pays
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.160]   with his life and with his blood.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.200]   Christ's unforgiveness is actually,
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.800]   or his forgiveness is unfair 'cause it's unearned,
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.920]   but it's this beautiful exchange
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.440]   where God himself would take upon him
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.800]   the consequences of the mistakes we've made.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.240]   I'm preaching this sermon three times,
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.480]   but even as I think about it now,
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.680]   I don't know, there's just something
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.720]   about really sitting in the reality
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.400]   that God would do that.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.920]   I think we know it, we do know it,
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.720]   but not enough do we sit in it.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:42.160]   And I'm just thankful.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.160]   I'm just really thankful.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.280]   Beyond what it does for me and all the things
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.480]   that might get after it,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.360]   I'm just thankful that his love looks like that,
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.520]   that his forgiveness is that powerful.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:36:01.680]   When we consider the weight of our sin,
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.880]   the re-exchange that takes place here,
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.160]   the God-sized mistakes that we've made,
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.520]   the God complex which we live within,
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:15.360]   when we consider just how deep our sin was and is,
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.400]   it gives us a great opportunity to see how much greater
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.680]   the forgiveness of God is to cancel the debt,
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:28.400]   to satisfy our debt.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.000]   Then we understand what Christ did for us.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.640]   Then we understand that his forgiveness
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.520]   isn't something that you earn.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.600]   You don't behave good enough and now you get forgiven.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.760]   You don't come to church enough and now you're forgiven.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.880]   You don't not say bad words and now you're forgiven.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.080]   No, it's not something you can earn.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.080]   It's something he has given to you of his own accord.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.800]   It's a grace and it's because of that
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.640]   that we can boast in no thing, no power, no wisdom,
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.680]   no gift, no nothing, nothing we've done,
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.080]   but it's a free gift given to all of us.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.960]   It's a ridiculous thing God has done.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:12.600]   That if we confess our sins, he would be faithful
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.960]   and he would be just to forgive us those sins,
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.160]   cleanse us of all unrighteousness.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.360]   The gospel is a proclamation of good news.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.480]   This is good news that Jesus is willing
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:28.040]   to forgive all people of all things.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.320]   And when we see that our sins are now forgiven,
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.560]   when we see the way in which he forgives us,
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.640]   the type of humility that he has to have,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.360]   the kind of sacrifice he's willing to make,
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.760]   we have to ask ourselves, what does it produce?
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.240]   We are forgiven, what does that actually mean?
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.760]   We understand sin, we understand his sacrifice,
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.840]   but what does it mean that we are forgiven?
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.520]   His forgiveness makes available to us
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:57.520]   a reconciled relationship and it reawakens our spirits
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.640]   and it reaffirms our identity into God's family.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.120]   In short, Christ's forgiveness is our salvation.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.120]   When you hear people say, are you saved?
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.520]   Well, I was saved on this date.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.040]   This is what we mean by saved.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.080]   His forgiveness leads us to that salvation.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.400]   It is our salvation.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.520]   In our sin, we lived as hostile towards God.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.600]   We lived as enemies towards God,
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.320]   but what Jesus's forgiveness does is that it brings you in.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.920]   He doesn't forgive you and say,
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.320]   now never come back again, I've forgiven you,
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.200]   now just leave.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.280]   No, he forgives and he draws you into himself.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.360]   He makes a channel, a pathway available
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.040]   that you can commune and know the heart of God
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.200]   to where the most sovereign being,
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.720]   the creator of everything will speak to you,
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.720]   will inspire you, will talk to you, will comfort you.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:58.840]   Right, like this is what his forgiveness does for us.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.120]   It's another exchange where,
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.720]   and before Christ's forgiveness,
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.640]   if God would look upon us, he would see our sin.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.320]   He would see where we've fallen short
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.680]   because of Christ's forgiveness
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.120]   and if we will accept that salvation,
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.360]   when God looks at you and exchange takes place,
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.880]   there is an imparted, Christ puts his righteousness,
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.880]   his perfect, flawless living, his sinless, pure life.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.560]   He puts all that he has actually done upon you
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.320]   so that when God looks at you, God's not angry.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.160]   You know that?
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.200]   Ask Christians the mistakes you've made.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.280]   When God looks at you, he's not annoyed.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.640]   He's not like, oh, you did it again.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.120]   But I think a lot of us feel that way.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.280]   It probably makes us hesitate to come close to God
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.640]   'cause we think he sees us for what we've done
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.520]   but the freedom that is found in Christ's forgiveness
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.600]   is that he sees you based off of what Jesus has done.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:59.480]   That's powerful forgiveness.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.040]   His righteousness, Christ's righteousness
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.680]   has been imputed towards us.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.720]   Another gift that we get
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.760]   is this reawakening of our spirits.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.480]   Right, so God could have forgiven us
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.520]   and left us be, okay, he draws us in
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:16.680]   and he now looks at us the way that Christ behaved
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.880]   but then he gives us a spirit.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.840]   He gives us his spirit that acts as our counselor,
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.440]   as our comforter, as our companion.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.200]   It's the one that helps us understand scripture
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.280]   and the word of God.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.360]   He gives us this beautiful gift of himself.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.920]   Like how many times do you forgive someone
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.000]   and say, also, I have a gift for you?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.920]   This is not very common, right?
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.120]   This is how Christ's forgiveness looks like.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.120]   He draws you in and then he gives you stuff.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.280]   He gives you himself, his spirit,
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.720]   not just the breath that we see in Genesis
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.600]   where he breathed his spirit and we're alive.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.600]   Now he sends his spirit to forever dwell in us
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.680]   and it says that with the spirit of God in us,
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:06.160]   we would be able to do even more than Christ has done.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.840]   Oh, he lived perfect.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.680]   That's just wild, right?
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.000]   Like what a gift.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.880]   This is what he gives us in his forgiveness.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.440]   Our spirits are reawakened
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.920]   and we end up becoming people who live by the spirit.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.720]   Most of Paul's books would have some section
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.760]   in his epistles about living by the spirit,
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.960]   being you in the spirit.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.880]   It's because of this idea that Jesus' forgiveness doesn't,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.600]   I think a lot of us think, it wipes the slate clean, right?
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.240]   It wipes the sins that we had here, it just wipes it.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.400]   I kinda wish I had a whiteboard, I could show you it.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.840]   He doesn't wipe it, he like throws the board away
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.040]   and he gives you a new one.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.160]   It's not about like cleaning it off.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.800]   It's Jesus gives you a new,
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.480]   this is why it says that in Galatians,
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   the old is gone, the new has come in Christ Jesus.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.360]   He's not trying to clean off how bad your sins are,
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.840]   he's giving you something new.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.280]   He's giving you a new life, a new spirit,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.920]   a newness that we can now live in the spirit,
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.640]   we can now walk in the spirit,
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.480]   we can set our hearts and our eyes
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.560]   on things of the spirit.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.160]   He's giving us a new slate, we are made new.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.960]   And the last thing he does,
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.520]   which I just think is absolutely wild, genuinely crazy,
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.700]   is this idea that he brings us into his family.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.740]   I just can't imagine a scenario
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.920]   where you forgive someone of a tremendous debt
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.320]   and then after you forgive them, you say,
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.320]   also, here's my will, I'm writing your name on it.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.320]   Like, think about this stuff.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.760]   Like, this is the gospel,
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.680]   that Jesus not only forgives you of his sin,
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.620]   but he brings you into his family.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:51.040]   He says, you used to be sons and daughters of wrath
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.800]   and you deserve death, but now you are children of God.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   First John, where we get our anchor verse,
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.440]   we've been reading like three times today,
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.240]   in the few verses or the few chapters that are there,
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   John refers to us as children 13 times.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.920]   Like, it's really clear that God wants you in the family.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.740]   He doesn't want you thinking, I have to earn this.
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.080]   My son doesn't earn my love.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.560]   Remy will never have to earn my love
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.280]   because they're my children.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.280]   And if I can love my kids this way,
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.760]   how much more will God love you?
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.440]   He brings you in.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.460]   Modern day forgiveness is, you say you're sorry,
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.240]   maybe I'm a little angry, but whatever,
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.180]   I don't have to see you again.
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.440]   We forgive and we forget.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.400]   That's not God's playbook.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.120]   This is not how we've been forgiven.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.840]   The forgiveness offered to you is he forgives you
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:40.880]   and he brings you in and he floods you with gifts,
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.280]   with his spirit, with an awakening in your spirits
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   where you can sense the things of the spirit.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.640]   He puts you on the list.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.440]   You are now a child of God.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.960]   You inherit the goodness and all that God has.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.280]   The power of God resides in you.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.800]   Like, this is why we have to, the crux of the sermon,
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.420]   this is why we have to look at Christ's example
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.860]   of forgiveness, because this is the only place
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.080]   that we see forgiveness that looks like this.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.000]   No other religion, no other culture,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.420]   no other story has a forgiveness that looks like this.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:17.080]   This is like not even heard of anywhere.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.520]   It's absolutely one of one.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.480]   This is how Christ forgives.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.920]   He brings you into the family.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.720]   He doesn't treat you like family.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.060]   Paul would say he grafts you in.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.720]   You become his children.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.720]   And this is why he would say you must be born
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.800]   again, born into the family of God.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.140]   This is, it's so important that we get it.
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:42.000]   The family of God, you are in God's family.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.200]   Stop trying to earn it.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.840]   Don't think you can lose it.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.040]   If you accept his forgiveness,
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.160]   if you will walk that path to salvation,
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.560]   if you will journey with him, he puts you in the family.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.480]   You don't have to beat yourself up all the time.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.800]   You don't have to worry about your status.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.400]   No, he loves you.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.040]   He loves you.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.120]   He loves us.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.000]   I feel like this sermon,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.480]   and I feel like you probably think the same thing as well,
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.480]   could have been boiled down to like a three minute idea.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   'Cause it's just been the same thing
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.280]   over and over again about the gospel.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.680]   But ultimately, what it's saying is that
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.920]   despite what you've done,
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.580]   despite what you're prone to do,
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.000]   despite how big the mistakes you made,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.040]   or how terrible the choices you chose to make,
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.560]   despite how short you've come up,
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.480]   despite the frustrations that you might have caused,
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:39.800]   God is armed, and I use that word on purpose,
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.440]   he is armed with forgiveness,
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.440]   ready, quick to forgive, slow to anger.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:52.080]   This is our God.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.820]   This is the gospel.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:57.040]   This is why we call it good news, right?
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.880]   This is good news, not a clean slate,
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.280]   a new slate, fully new.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.800]   And I tell you this gospel story
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.480]   because it is of the utmost importance,
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.280]   and we have to remember, we have to remember,
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.360]   in our world we're flooded with so much stuff,
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:16.040]   we forget, we have to sit and remember
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.760]   what he's actually done for us.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.120]   What it actually looks like,
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.800]   the fact that it cost him things.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.200]   And forgiveness won't just be something
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.880]   that we muster up with our strength and we remember this.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.360]   If we can remember correctly,
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.800]   if we can remember what we've been forgiven from,
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.880]   perhaps it's gonna impact the way that we forgive.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.960]   And I wanna, before it comes out weird
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.320]   and you think I'm saying something else,
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.720]   I wanna clarify, I'm not saying that
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.160]   if you just trust in Jesus, all of a sudden,
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.560]   the way you are hurt won't hurt no more.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.880]   I'm not just saying that if you just trust in Jesus,
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.420]   forgiveness becomes easy overnight.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:56.320]   That's actually nowhere in the 66 books of scripture.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:00.280]   No, forgiveness is hard, and because it's hard,
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.520]   we need a strength that we don't find in ourselves.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:08.880]   If you were here for Converse, I just chose a few.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.800]   We had a prayer station where you got a chance
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.620]   to write the things that you were dealing with
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.000]   when it came to forgiveness, some of the offenses,
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.640]   some of the hurt that you're living with.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.600]   Forgiveness isn't easy because we've had hurt in our lives.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:25.280]   Someone wrote, "I forgive blank for betraying my trust
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   "and my love for you."
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.320]   That causes deep hurt.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:33.000]   You can't just will your way or Jesus coat that, right?
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.720]   Someone wrote, "Forgiving myself,
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.520]   "even though I know I'm sinful,
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.880]   "God has already forgiven me,
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:42.460]   "and I need to quit the shame because I'm a new person."
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.960]   Someone else just wrote, "Forgiveness towards God."
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.600]   Someone wrote, "Forgiving themselves."
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.280]   Two people wrote, "Forgiving themselves."
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.160]   Someone said, "Forgiving my ma and my pa."
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.020]   "I release forgiveness.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:59.120]   "The things you did hurt, but I know you did your best."
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:03.920]   Forgiveness, when it's that close, is hard.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.880]   "Lord, help me let go of the way my in-laws treat me."
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.240]   I know most people make a joke about that,
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.280]   but that will impact your life, right?
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.040]   "My dad, my grandmother, my country,
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.440]   "my old friends, my family."
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.640]   Guys, forgiveness isn't something that a sermon fixes.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.040]   It's something that Jesus helps us with.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.760]   So, forgiveness is still gonna be super hard after this.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:33.120]   So, I do want it to be debunked.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   I want it to be clear
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.680]   that you don't have to have the strength
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.420]   to forgive on your own.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:45.220]   That forgiveness isn't something that you just do,
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.040]   but that forgiveness is actually something
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.520]   that requires supernatural strength.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.120]   When we still carry the pains of our hurt,
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.420]   we need God's help to forgive.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.640]   When we still live with the scars of what's been done to us,
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.200]   we need God's help to forgive.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.360]   In order for us to come close to this
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.640]   forgive your brother 70 times seven concept,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.860]   we need God's help.
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:13.200]   And that's what the gospel shows us.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.740]   So, look, I have two points, super simple.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.840]   The goal of this sermon is to help you remember.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.680]   It's to create space for us to remember the gospel,
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.720]   what Jesus has done, and to see it real, real clear.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.760]   And so, the two things I want you to take with you,
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.640]   I want us to remember so that we know
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.760]   what forgiveness truly looks like, okay?
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.680]   Remember so that you know exactly
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.640]   what you were forgiven from,
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.020]   exactly who forgave you and what that sacrifice cost them.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:48.420]   Remember so that you can know what forgiveness looks like.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:51.960]   The second thing is remember so that we don't,
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.560]   so that we know where to go for our strength.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.920]   So that we don't go to other places
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.480]   thinking that this person or this,
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.160]   this thing is gonna help me forgive.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:09.120]   There's no other forgiveness story out there like this.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:13.860]   Only in Jesus can you find this kind of forgiveness
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:17.680]   for yourself and find the strength to lean on him
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.520]   and that spirit in him that is now in you
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.020]   to forgive others of the things that they've done.
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.720]   Forgiveness is important.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.280]   It's very important to all of our hearts.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.580]   And so today, I wanna create space for us,
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.500]   not just to stand up and sing,
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.460]   so I'm gonna again ask you not to stand up.
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.000]   You can sing if you want.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.760]   But we're gonna create space to sit for a minute
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.520]   and just think and just reflect.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.040]   Because there's some of us here who,
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.640]   if we think about it, if we ask ourselves
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:51.560]   and we're honest, today's a chance for us to realize
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.440]   it's not about how hard we try to earn God's forgiveness.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:59.340]   It requires God's help to forgive others.
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:02.360]   There are some of us today who this is just a chance
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.120]   to slow down and stop striving.
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:08.460]   There's some of us today who don't know Jesus.
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:11.320]   And this is a chance to come in closer
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.640]   and ask him to reveal himself to you.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.280]   That this gospel, this good news,
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.000]   this is not for all people.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.800]   It's for those who will confess their sins.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   There's a condition to believe in him,
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.160]   not believe in yourself.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.320]   So maybe you're here today,
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.860]   this is your first time hearing the gospel.
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:37.820]   Maybe you're here today and you just need help.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.360]   He is our ever-present help.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.680]   That's such a good phrase.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.740]   Like always present, always available,
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.800]   never taking a nap, never on vacation.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.600]   He's always present, ever-present help.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.760]   Maybe today's a chance for you to lean
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.720]   upon that ever-present help.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.880]   I don't know what kind of work he needs to do,
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:51:59.000]   but I'm gonna get off stage,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.160]   the band's gonna sing that song.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.000]   Don't get up, don't rush out, guys.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:04.840]   Lunch can wait.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.860]   Sit in this.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.760]   Ask God, what is he saying?
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.920]   What is he revealing?
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.400]   What is he unearthing?
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.020]   What is he building in you?
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.180]   Let him do a little bit of work in you today.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.280]   That's why we're here.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.860]   (gentle music)
