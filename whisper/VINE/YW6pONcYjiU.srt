1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
 Amen, amen, amen.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,460
 We wanna thank the worship team.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,300
 Thank you guys.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,740
 (congregation applauding)

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,460
 Why don't you go ahead and grab a seat, everyone.

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,500
 Welcome to the Vine.

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,160
 Welcome to the 11 o'clock as per youge.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,260
 It is full.

9
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,940
 It is real full.

10
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,920
 There's like no room in here at all.

11
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,660
 Well, guys, I am Promise.

12
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,820
 I am the creative pastor here at the Vine.

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,700
 Welcome, so glad you're here.

14
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,640
 And to those who are watching online, also welcome.

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,000
 We're so glad that you're tuned in.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,420
 You're not here, but you're kind of here.

17
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,260
 So thanks for that connection.

18
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,000
 We've been going through this series over the past few,

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,700
 actually since the beginning of the year on intimacy.

20
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,540
 All right, if you've been here,

21
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,200
 you would have heard Pastor Andrew talk about this idea,

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,540
 this concept of intimacy.

23
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,380
 And it's a strange word trying to figure out

24
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,220
 what does that mean?

25
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,220
 So we've been exploring it.

26
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,220
 We've been peeling back the layers and understanding

27
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,780
 what does it mean for you and for me

28
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,380
 to find our intimacy with God?

29
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,440
 Pastor Andrew would have shared with you

30
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,200
 that we as a leadership here at the Vine

31
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,080
 have been really wrestling with this idea.

32
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,640
 God spoke to us and has challenged us

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,960
 to lead the charge in helping us all understand

34
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,680
 that God has called us not just to come into the gates

35
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,280
 and stand at the entrance.

36
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,120
 Or another way of putting it,

37
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,200
 he's not called us to settle for the atmosphere of God,

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,560
 but he actually has called us to press in

39
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,720
 to the person of who God is.

40
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,080
 Intimacy is when we press beyond the atmosphere.

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,100
 We don't just settle for an idea of God,

42
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,260
 but pressing in to the person of who God himself is.

43
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,920
 To not just be satisfied with the atmosphere.

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,780
 This kind of call is an invitation to a real journey.

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,600
 Intimacy is not a one-time thing.

46
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,340
 It doesn't just snap and happen.

47
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,320
 It's a whole journey.

48
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,360
 And so far we've looked at some of the obstacles

49
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,680
 that present themselves in our journey

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,580
 towards intimacy with God.

51
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,320
 The first thing we talked about with this concept

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,380
 of rumors of God, how if we're not careful,

53
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,640
 we can settle for secondhand accounts

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
 of what someone else says about God

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,680
 to be our primary intimacy.

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,320
 Pastor Andrew would have had this little basket

57
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,560
 and he would have shown you what it looks like to harvest

58
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,080
 and what it looks like to glean,

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,800
 to pick up the leftovers of what somebody else said.

60
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,120
 And in order for us to actually have intimacy with Christ,

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,180
 we cannot allow the substance of our spiritual life

62
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,720
 to just be on someone else's account.

63
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,940
 Intimacy means you and me have to do the hard work

64
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,200
 of actually being relational with God, coming close to him.

65
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,680
 We can't just let it be someone else's story

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,840
 or someone else's sermon.

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,920
 That's predominantly why you hear us regularly say

68
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,560
 that church cannot just be 90 minutes on a Sunday.

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
 That's not just a cool saying.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,640
 It's 'cause for you to be intimate with God,

71
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,880
 you've gotta press through.

72
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,880
 It's gotta be your time as well.

73
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,040
 The idea of secondhand rumors of God,

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,740
 what other people says can be a challenge to our intimacy.

75
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,740
 And if you were here last week,

76
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,860
 you also heard Pastor Andrew talk

77
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,420
 about this idea of blessings, right?

78
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,740
 And blessings are a good thing.

79
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,220
 We all love blessings.

80
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,620
 I want blessings, you want blessings,

81
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,460
 we all want blessings.

82
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,240
 Blessings aren't bad.

83
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,140
 However, our relationship to blessings,

84
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,540
 our posture to blessings is worth questioning.

85
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,620
 We have the temptation sometimes if we're not careful

86
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,640
 to evaluate our intimacy with God

87
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,080
 based off of how blessed we are,

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,960
 how many things he's given us.

89
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,900
 And if we determine our intimacy with God

90
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,840
 based off of our blessings,

91
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,160
 we all know that blessings come and blessings go.

92
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
 Some days we are extremely blessed

93
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,440
 and it's everywhere and it's evident and it's tangible.

94
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,380
 Some days we're in the desert,

95
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,320
 but that doesn't mean God has left you.

96
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,840
 It doesn't mean God is absent.

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,940
 That's why we can't build our intimacy on blessings

98
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,440
 because we end up building our intimacies with blessings.

99
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,080
 We end up worshiping the gift over the giver,

100
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,660
 finding ourselves in a form of idolatry.

101
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,700
 That's the second thing that ends up being an obstacle,

102
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,700
 a challenge to our relationship of intimacy with God.

103
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,080
 See, intimacy is such a powerful thing.

104
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,280
 Intimacy is vast.

105
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,960
 It's going to shape the way that you see yourself,

106
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,420
 the way that you see life,

107
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,320
 the way that you are aligned,

108
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
 the things that you understand.

109
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,160
 And if we're intimate with God, He shapes us.

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
 He aligns us to Him and to His will.

111
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,560
 He shapes our motivations, our preferences,

112
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,280
 our thought process, the way that we think.

113
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
 He shapes our philosophies and our worldviews

114
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,680
 and our behaviors and our practices.

115
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,880
 Intimacy and this closeness with God aligns us to Him

116
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,640
 so that we can know and be close to the heart of God.

117
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,640
 We can hear the creator speak

118
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,800
 and know that when we speak, He listens and hears us.

119
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,600
 Now, if we actually pull it back a little further,

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 yeah, I dare say that intimacy is the gift of God Himself.

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,560
 That's why we're talking about it.

122
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
 That's why it's so important.

123
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,640
 Now, achieving intimacy is one thing, right?

124
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,040
 Getting there, I'm intimate, awesome, cool.

125
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,080
 Maintaining intimacy is a whole 'nother struggle.

126
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,720
 Yes, there are things that will prevent us

127
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,360
 in our pursuits of intimacy,

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,680
 but once we have achieved

129
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,660
 and once we have become intimate with God,

130
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,200
 there are also other things.

131
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,200
 There are also false gods, lesser goods,

132
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,720
 alternatives, faulty substitutes that position themselves

133
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,680
 and present themselves as viable options to God,

134
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,520
 looking to take our worship and our attention and our time.

135
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,960
 There are substitutes that are all around us,

136
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,480
 not just obstacles blocking us,

137
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,680
 things that we can literally turn to accidentally

138
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,100
 and find our intimacy with them.

139
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,500
 And that's what we're gonna be looking at

140
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,820
 over the next two weeks.

141
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,260
 Two major things that we, if we're not careful,

142
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,260
 will turn to and find intimacy with,

143
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,260
 things that literally end up taking the place

144
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,980
 of God in our lives.

145
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,540
 So with that said, let's talk about these things

146
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,460
 that we turn to.

147
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,060
 It's good for us to understand this,

148
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,380
 that we have this tendency that when we fail

149
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,640
 to find intimacy in Christ,

150
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,280
 we are then tempted to turn somewhere else.

151
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,880
 Now this is not like some big spiritual concept.

152
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,040
 This is an everyday thing.

153
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,120
 If you try at something and you fail to find the success

154
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,980
 you need at it, by nature,

155
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,920
 you're gonna look somewhere else for it, right?

156
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,800
 Like if I try hard to turn this light on

157
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,960
 and it's not working, I'm gonna go find another light.

158
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,800
 That just makes sense.

159
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,720
 That's just common sense.

160
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,880
 But for us, we have to be aware that

161
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,160
 if we fail to find intimacy

162
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,260
 or fail to find satisfaction in Christ,

163
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,400
 then these other things become seemingly more desirable,

164
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,820
 seemingly like they'll fulfill more,

165
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,360
 like they will give us the validation

166
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,620
 and the significance that we think that we need,

167
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,680
 that they would satisfy.

168
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,440
 And if we're not aware, other things,

169
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,580
 good things, end up taking the place in our hearts

170
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,400
 that only God was ever actually meant to occupy.

171
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,280
 And that's why we have to wrap our heads around this

172
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,560
 and think around it and be careful.

173
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,980
 Perhaps one of the most common,

174
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,400
 one of the easiest forms,

175
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,400
 one of the most inconspicuous things that wrestles

176
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,520
 and seeks and pulls us into intimacy.

177
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,640
 And if we're not aware of it,

178
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,400
 we'll find ourselves turning to it time and time again.

179
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,240
 It's called the world.

180
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,040
 Now, I grew up in church

181
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
 and I've heard the phrase the world a lot.

182
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,000
 It speaks, it's really big, it's kind of a big concept.

183
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,560
 It doesn't really say a lot, is the world,

184
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,600
 what does that even mean, right?

185
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,840
 Like the world is a lot,

186
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,320
 but the world is also nothing in this explanation.

187
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,680
 But we do know that scripture as a whole

188
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,560
 speaks about this concept of the world.

189
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,880
 And my hope is that as we look into scripture today,

190
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,240
 we'll be able to help you understand

191
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,360
 what does it mean for the world to vie for our affections

192
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,060
 and what does it look like for our response

193
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,280
 to be correct in that.

194
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,000
 Specifically, the author John in 1 John

195
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,960
 has a lot to say about the world.

196
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,760
 So if you have your Bibles, if you have your smartphones,

197
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,920
 if you like the screen, we have it right here.

198
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,800
 So let's read this together, it says this.

199
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,200
 Do not love the world or anything in the world.

200
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,720
 If anyone loves the world,

201
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,040
 love for the Father is not in them.

202
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,800
 For everything in the world, the lust of the flesh

203
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
 and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life

204
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,540
 comes not from the Father, but from the world.

205
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,200
 The world and its desires pass away,

206
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,360
 but whoever does the will of God lives forever.

207
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,560
 Let me pray for us.

208
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,500
 God, we come before your word knowing that it's speak,

209
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,600
 that it's living and active,

210
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,320
 that it's meant to speak to our hearts,

211
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,960
 that it's meant to shape us and change us.

212
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,880
 So Holy Spirit, would you open us this morning?

213
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,480
 Would you allow us to position ourselves

214
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,760
 to hear from you, God?

215
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,080
 What your word has to say,

216
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,600
 will you allow us to position ourselves

217
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,880
 to be shaped by the truth found in your word, God?

218
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,620
 May it speak and may we be a people who hear and respond.

219
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,580
 So you name me pray, amen.

220
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,800
 So the first thing that we see in this passage

221
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,360
 is that John is gonna create somewhat of a duality.

222
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,820
 He's gonna create two options.

223
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,720
 There's the way of the world,

224
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,040
 then there's the way of the Father.

225
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,960
 He's not saying that they're bad or good,

226
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,320
 he's just saying there's the world and there is the Father.

227
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,680
 Two different ways, two paths,

228
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,840
 if you would have it that way,

229
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,840
 two alternative options for how your intimacy can be placed

230
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,640
 and how you can live.

231
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,040
 Actually, if we zoom in even further,

232
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,200
 we'll see that across these two passages,

233
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,200
 John is going to emphasize one phrase a lot.

234
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,320
 He's gonna look at the word the world

235
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,960
 six times in two verses.

236
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,500
 Do not love the world, anything in the world,

237
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,600
 if anyone loves the world, in the world,

238
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,160
 from the world, the world and its desires.

239
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,280
 John is speaking predominantly to a concept of the world

240
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
 and when something, a good little tip for you

241
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,440
 in your Bible studying, in your scripture reading,

242
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,600
 when you read a passage and you see a phrase

243
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
 show up over and over and over and over again,

244
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,480
 the author is intending for us to pick something up.

245
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,360
 He's showing us what the key concept truly is.

246
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,160
 And what John is doing here is showing us

247
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,560
 that there's something about the world

248
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
 that we need to understand before we decide

249
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,600
 where our allegiance will be.

250
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,280
 So the word that he uses to represent the world

251
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,840
 is the Greek word that we get our English word,

252
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,440
 cosmos, from.

253
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,480
 Now, the cosmos is something that might be quite familiar

254
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,380
 to all of us, right?

255
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,760
 Cosmos speaks of the world.

256
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,080
 We think of the physical planet, the physical space.

257
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,300
 That's one of the biggest definitions

258
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,240
 of what that word means,

259
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,460
 speaking of the earth and matter and substance

260
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,440
 and things that are tangible that we can feel and touch.

261
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,360
 However, when John is talking about that,

262
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,640
 he's talking about the world,

263
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,460
 it would be really odd to utilize this definition,

264
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,640
 to not love the physical space,

265
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,280
 to not love the earth and the ground

266
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,320
 and the sphere that we live in.

267
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,840
 So actually, in Greek, there's two definitions,

268
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,860
 or two primary definitions to the word cosmos.

269
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,000
 Yes, there is the idea of the earth and the physical space.

270
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,120
 However, there's a secondary definition

271
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,240
 which speaks of this.

272
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,000
 It speaks to systems and structural ways of doing things

273
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,920
 that are different from God.

274
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,320
 That's what the word itself means.

275
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,000
 The world can speak of the sphere,

276
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,920
 or it can speak of the systems that are different than God

277
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,200
 in how we do things,

278
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,940
 speaking to the intangible elements of the world.

279
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,000
 So for us to understand what he's saying

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,940
 about these systems and its impact,

281
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,780
 we're gonna dive really deeply into the idea of the world.

282
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,820
 I'm gonna give us an easy definition to remember

283
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,960
 so that we can hold onto it.

284
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,840
 So when I say the phrase the world,

285
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,260
 we won't think so general,

286
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,380
 but we'll have a clear position of what that means, okay?

287
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,740
 Everyone with me still?

288
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,900
 All right, so when we speak of the world,

289
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,820
 John is primarily saying this,

290
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,580
 the societal or cultural systems and attitudes

291
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,700
 that govern our values, beliefs, and practices.

292
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,560
 Say that one more time.

293
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,540
 When John is saying do not love the world

294
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,900
 and the world this and the world that,

295
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,620
 he's speaking of the societal or cultural systems

296
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,820
 and attitudes that govern our values,

297
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,940
 beliefs, and our practices.

298
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,400
 See, culture can shape things around us.

299
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,420
 Culture is powerful.

300
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,020
 It can shape the way that we process information.

301
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,900
 It can govern our understanding

302
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,820
 of our feelings and our behavior.

303
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,340
 It can define for us what is right,

304
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,140
 and it can define for us what is wrong.

305
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,780
 It becomes the lens that we wear

306
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,040
 to evaluate the experiences that we have

307
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,180
 as either good or worthy or not enjoyable.

308
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,580
 Culture is powerful because it sets for us

309
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,540
 a set of general norms that we live within,

310
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,340
 and sometimes we don't even question it.

311
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,660
 It's just the way things are, right?

312
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,540
 Culture shapes and molds the way that we think.

313
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,740
 So when John is speaking of the world,

314
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,860
 he's speaking of the authority that we give culture

315
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,220
 to decide for us what is true and what is right,

316
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,820
 what is good, what is important,

317
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,180
 what our priorities should be,

318
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,020
 what we should believe, and what we should do.

319
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,380
 And if he's saying that six times across two verses,

320
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,040
 let's actually ask ourselves,

321
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,660
 what does culture actually say?

322
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,500
 We all live here.

323
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,160
 What does culture say to us, right?

324
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,820
 Culture directs the way that we live.

325
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,820
 It directs our lives.

326
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,460
 It tells us, study hard, work harder,

327
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,620
 get a good job, save a lot of money.

328
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,140
 Don't get married so you can afford

329
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,940
 to take care of your spouse and feed your kids, right?

330
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,900
 Nothing bad about that.

331
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,060
 Those are actually some good statements, good ways to live.

332
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,700
 But the culture that we live in values that.

333
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,840
 It tells us this is how we ought to be.

334
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,780
 Culture gives us formula.

335
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,820
 It says if you work hard or work hard enough,

336
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,140
 you'll earn a lot and you'll be able

337
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,020
 to take care of yourself.

338
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,060
 And give the money to things that are promising,

339
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,780
 to things of value.

340
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,460
 Save a lot for yourself.

341
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,960
 You never know when you're gonna need

342
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,640
 some extra change.

343
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,580
 Culture can define our behavior.

344
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,940
 An eye for an eye.

345
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,780
 Do the practical thing that makes sense.

346
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,660
 Don't loan money to people who can't pay you back.

347
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,420
 Eh, it kinda makes sense.

348
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,740
 You get what you deserve.

349
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,960
 Take care of yourself first.

350
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,060
 Worry about your own problems.

351
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,180
 Mind your own business before you worry

352
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,620
 about the other person's issues.

353
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,980
 Seek the road that gives you the highest return.

354
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,700
 Perhaps seek pleasure and avoid pain.

355
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,300
 Love your neighbor.

356
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,040
 Treat your neighbor good.

357
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,200
 Maybe not hate your enemy,

358
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,400
 but don't got time for haters, right?

359
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,760
 Haters are gonna hate, I think is the famous phrase

360
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,160
 that goes around these days.

361
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,500
 Culture validates significance.

362
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,720
 You have meaning because you're popular.

363
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,520
 You have value because what you're saying

364
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,480
 and what you're doing and what you're producing is relevant.

365
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,920
 The more followers you have,

366
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,640
 the higher your worth somehow becomes.

367
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,800
 That's a weird system.

368
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,660
 The more friends you have online,

369
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,040
 that makes you into a more likable person.

370
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,880
 Maybe, but that's just kind of what we've accepted.

371
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,440
 That's kind of how things are.

372
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,920
 And perhaps the most interesting one

373
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,160
 is that culture shapes the how.

374
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,880
 Manifest it and it will happen.

375
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,320
 Have you ever heard that idea?

376
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,240
 Manifest it and it'll happen, just will it into existence.

377
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,040
 Life is what you make of it.

378
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
 Live your truth.

379
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
 You're the captain of your soul.

380
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,220
 Self-care and repeat, just follow your heart.

381
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,060
 Just live.

382
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,920
 I think YOLO used to be a cool thing for millennials.

383
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,640
 Where I come from, it's risk it for the biscuit.

384
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,520
 Or if you grew up in black culture,

385
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,060
 it's you do you, boo-boo.

386
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,920
 All right, like these are the things that we hear.

387
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,020
 These are the things that ends up shaping us.

388
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,360
 The reality is that these sayings and these beliefs

389
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,160
 are a direct byproduct of the culture we live in.

390
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,400
 They are what the world says.

391
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,800
 So when John speaks of the world,

392
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,000
 he's speaking of the systems and attitudes

393
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,760
 predominantly brought on by our culture and our society.

394
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,880
 It's the way that our society sees and perceives things.

395
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,040
 It's not evil, per se.

396
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,940
 It's not bad, even.

397
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,760
 It's the way it is.

398
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,920
 It becomes the norm.

399
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,680
 It's our default way of operating.

400
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,240
 It's just the way that we go.

401
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,920
 In this whole passage,

402
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,320
 John gives us all these ideas of the world,

403
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,040
 but then he interjects,

404
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,600
 and he's actually changing the direction of everything

405
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,660
 by introducing the Father.

406
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,580
 He's saying, yes, there's a way, there's a default system.

407
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,160
 There are norms, there's culture,

408
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,000
 there's society that tells you how to live

409
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,160
 and what to do and what to believe

410
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,600
 and what your priorities should be,

411
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,060
 but there's also another way.

412
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,560
 There's also the way of the Father.

413
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,680
 There's also a different way.

414
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,600
 Much like when he speaks of the world,

415
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,840
 John refers to the Father.

416
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,840
 He's primarily speaking about how God and kingdom values

417
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,200
 can shape the way that we see the world.

418
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,400
 And all that happens because Christ comes into the world

419
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,860
 and reveals to us both who God is,

420
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,440
 the heart of God, the nature of God, who we are.

421
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,480
 It's based off of Christ's revelation.

422
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,000
 So in Christ, we have a tangible and clear picture

423
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,480
 of the Father, of the way of the Father.

424
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,400
 By this, Christ ends up shaping how we see things,

425
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
 how we process information.

426
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,560
 He defines for us what is right and what is good

427
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,400
 and what is wrong.

428
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,480
 Christ becomes the lens by which we evaluate

429
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,760
 the experiences in our world

430
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,400
 if we are subscribed to this way of the Father.

431
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,900
 Christ shapes and molds our thinking.

432
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,980
 So when John speaks of the Father,

433
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,000
 he's speaking of the authority that we have given Christ

434
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,500
 to decide for us what is true and what is right,

435
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,660
 what is important, what is priority, and what is good.

436
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,240
 So what does the option of Christ say?

437
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,560
 Christ shows us how to live.

438
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,520
 He tells us to love God with all your heart

439
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,960
 and all your mind and all your soul and all your strength

440
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,900
 and to love your neighbor as yourself.

441
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,400
 Really good things, nobody's gonna say no to that.

442
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,120
 Christ says he welcomes those who are vulnerable.

443
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,320
 He says, "Blessed are the poor in spirit."

444
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,280
 This was revolutionary when it was spoken.

445
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,400
 "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness."

446
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,480
 Perhaps my favorite one.

447
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,820
 "Blessed are you when you are persecuted falsely."

448
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,180
 Blessed are the victims?

449
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,020
 Ooh.

450
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,520
 Christ redefines our strength.

451
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,320
 He says, "Blessed are the meek.

452
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,180
 "Seek justice for the marginalized

453
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,600
 "and take care of the widow and the orphan.

454
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,880
 "Care for the alien and the stranger in your land."

455
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,000
 He says, "Give without expecting a return."

456
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,360
 I think the parable he says,

457
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,800
 "When your right hand is giving,

458
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,600
 "make sure your left hand doesn't know what's happening."

459
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,420
 Right?

460
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,280
 He says, "Yeah, love your neighbor,

461
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,840
 "but get this, love your enemy."

462
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,980
 Christ says, "Turn the other cheek

463
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,320
 "and maybe go the extra mile."

464
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,320
 Not just if someone requires you to go a mile with them,

465
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,620
 go a mile further.

466
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,680
 Christ defines, redefines our strength.

467
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,240
 Christ purifies our heart.

468
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
 He says, "Blessed are the pure in hearts.

469
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,660
 "Do good deeds so that your Father will be glorified.

470
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,380
 "Beware of practicing your righteousness

471
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,400
 "in front of other people.

472
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,060
 "Store up treasures not here on earth, but in heaven.

473
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,640
 "Humble yourself before the Lord."

474
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,280
 And lastly, Christ is our source.

475
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,640
 He will tell us things like this.

476
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,280
 "Do not be anxious.

477
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,960
 "Ask God for what you need.

478
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,720
 "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done."

479
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,800
 If God clothed the lilies of the field,

480
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,040
 how much more would He clothe you?

481
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,440
 If God would feed the birds of the air,

482
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,600
 how much more would He feed you?

483
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,480
 He tells us that if you have to ask, it'll be given.

484
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,700
 "Every good and perfect gift comes from the Father above.

485
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,940
 "The heart is deceitful above all else.

486
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,280
 "Man might plan his way,

487
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,880
 "but it's the Lord that directs his steps."

488
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,400
 See, these sayings and beliefs,

489
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,360
 this is the way of the Father.

490
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,280
 They reflect the heart of God.

491
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,080
 In the intimate journey of transformation,

492
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,040
 He takes His followers on, those who are submitted to Him.

493
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,920
 We become shaped and molded by the way of the Father.

494
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,080
 So when John speaks of the Father, it's these systems.

495
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,880
 It's these attitudes predominantly brought on by Christ

496
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,500
 at the center of our lives.

497
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,960
 So with an understanding of the way of the world,

498
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,720
 culture, society, things that are just okay,

499
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,880
 not bad, not good, just are, and the way of the Father,

500
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,800
 John now turns our attention to understand

501
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,760
 the relationship between the two,

502
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,960
 and what we, who we are to be,

503
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,160
 relating to the world and to the Father.

504
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,980
 John would say this,

505
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,980
 "Do not love the world or anything in the world."

506
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:26,040
 I'll say that again, 'cause that's a really big statement.

507
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,860
 "Do not love the world or anything in the world."

508
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,280
 If anyone loves the world,

509
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,680
 love for the Father is not in them.

510
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,640
 Let me put this in sermon series language for us

511
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,080
 so we stay quite relevant.

512
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,220
 "Do not find your intimacy with the world."

513
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,280
 You cannot afford to find your intimacy with the world

514
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,640
 if the love of the Father is meant to be evident in you.

515
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,480
 All right?

516
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,720
 [coughing]

517
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,160
 John divides us two different ways, two different paths.

518
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,840
 He separates them, and I think the temptation for us

519
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,840
 is a lot more subtle than this text.

520
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,880
 I think whenever we hear about the world or idols,

521
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,440
 we're like, "Okay, I'm not bound on idols.

522
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,840
 "I'm not worshiping the world, I'm okay."

523
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,080
 And I think for most of us, most mornings,

524
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,120
 we don't wake up, pop out of bed, alarm clock goes off,

525
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,420
 and we're like, "All right, what am I gonna do today?

526
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,120
 "Let's worship the world."

527
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,160
 I don't think that's on anyone's agenda, right?

528
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,540
 No one wakes up like, "How can I love the world?

529
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,840
 "How can I put God on the shelf?

530
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,020
 "How can I forget about Christ?

531
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,040
 "How can I just worship the world

532
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,120
 "and myself and myself and the world?"

533
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,000
 I think it's actually significantly more subtle,

534
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,680
 therefore more dangerous than that.

535
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,880
 I think for a lot of us, and please don't miss this,

536
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,600
 for a lot of us, we wanna love Jesus.

537
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,480
 We wanna do the right thing.

538
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,840
 We wanna be intimate with Jesus.

539
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,560
 We wanna have Jesus.

540
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,480
 But if we're honest, we also wanna sprinkle

541
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,800
 a little bit of the world on there.

542
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,220
 We also want some of the things that the world offers,

543
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,460
 some of society's values, some of society's preferences.

544
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,580
 So perhaps we subscribe quite a lot

545
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,720
 to the way that the world operates.

546
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,080
 And that's the tricky thing.

547
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,820
 We want the, "I buy Jesus and get a side of the world,"

548
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,700
 the combo meal, the buy one, get one free concept.

549
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,100
 And John is saying, "It doesn't work that way.

550
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,800
 "It cannot work that way."

551
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,140
 Those two things, you can't have 'em both.

552
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,660
 You can't be walking towards Jesus,

553
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,060
 but also walking towards the world, right?

554
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,400
 It's like this lamp.

555
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,980
 It's either on or it's off.

556
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,060
 It can't be on/off.

557
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,900
 Doesn't exist, right?

558
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,180
 So I can, if I pull harder, it'll be, no, no, it's still on.

559
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,900
 If I pull it again, it's still off.

560
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,500
 There's no middle ground.

561
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,300
 There's no fence to sit on.

562
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,780
 And if we're honest with ourselves,

563
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,180
 most of us, if we evaluate where we are, are fence sitters.

564
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,860
 We're trying to get some Jesus

565
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,920
 and we're trying to come to church,

566
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,980
 but also when we go through Monday to Friday,

567
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,500
 where some of our practices might be a bit dodgy

568
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,300
 and some of the preferences that we have

569
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,340
 may be a bit cutthroat

570
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,420
 and we might not really love our neighbor.

571
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,340
 We might tolerate them

572
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,380
 and we definitely don't love our enemies.

573
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,300
 The two things kind of don't work.

574
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,780
 They can't go together.

575
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,100
 If your intimacy, I'll put it this way,

576
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,940
 it's a dichotomous scale, right?

577
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,260
 So the more you choose to be intimate

578
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,780
 with the things of the Father,

579
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,220
 if you walk towards the Father in your intimacy,

580
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,460
 you're actually walking away from the things of the world.

581
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,180
 Same vice versa.

582
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,280
 If we walk towards the world in our intimacy,

583
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,940
 we're walking away from the things of the Father.

584
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,580
 You can't do them both.

585
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,420
 Now here's the thing.

586
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,940
 I don't want to come across as someone who is condoning,

587
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,040
 you know, just be holy, live in your holy house

588
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
 on top of the hill and talk to no one

589
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,900
 and don't have Instagram and don't have friends

590
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,180
 and don't drive a car and don't have electricity.

591
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,580
 And I'm not saying that.

592
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,780
 That's actually not what the scripture is saying, right?

593
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,780
 To love God and to choose to walk closer to God,

594
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,840
 what it means is that these things control you less.

595
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,620
 These things own you less.

596
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,820
 They serve you, you don't serve them.

597
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,280
 There's a freedom that we step into

598
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,900
 when we choose to walk in intimacy with God

599
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,780
 and allow the things of the world,

600
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,060
 we're just saying it, the cross before me,

601
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,580
 the what behind me, the world behind me, right?

602
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,900
 It's this way of engaging with God

603
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,820
 where we are choosing to walk closer to him

604
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,820
 and leaving certain things behind by choice, by choice.

605
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,940
 The reality is if we aren't careful,

606
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,740
 we can allow culture and present philosophies

607
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,480
 and pseudo psychology and social norms

608
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,020
 to govern the way that we see things

609
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,100
 and practice life.

610
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,500
 If our aim and our chief satisfaction

611
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,900
 is in satisfying ourselves,

612
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,820
 if we give society the ultimate authority

613
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,960
 to define what is right and what is wrong, what is good,

614
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,220
 then we are in fact substituting intimacy with Christ

615
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,940
 for intimacy with the lust of the flesh,

616
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,380
 intimacy with the lust of the eyes,

617
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,280
 intimacy with the pride of life.

618
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,140
 And John makes it very clear.

619
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,620
 He goes, "These things do not come from the Father,

620
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,740
 "but from the world.

621
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,220
 "And the world and its desires will pass away.

622
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:19,220
 "But whosoever will do the will of the Father

623
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,500
 "lives forever."

624
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,620
 Incompatible, the two things don't mix.

625
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,220
 Think of oil and water.

626
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,420
 The values of love others first

627
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,840
 and humble yourself before God

628
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,700
 and blessed are the poor and the meek

629
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,580
 don't really work that well in the marketplace, right?

630
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,500
 It's kind of a hard thing to do.

631
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,460
 God's ways are different.

632
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,380
 His people therefore must be different.

633
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,260
 The values and methods of Christ

634
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,700
 when compared to the world, they cannot coexist.

635
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,620
 There is no blend of them.

636
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,780
 I know I'm beating that to a pulp,

637
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,220
 but I just gotta make that really clear.

638
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,860
 And I guess the question we have to ask ourselves is why?

639
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,920
 Why can't I have a little bit of Jesus

640
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,180
 and a little bit of world?

641
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,360
 Why do they not work out that way?

642
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,300
 Well, here's the thing.

643
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,660
 God is a jealous God.

644
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,900
 There's a place in your heart for God.

645
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,740
 There's a place you were created for him,

646
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,940
 by him, through him.

647
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,380
 You have life because of him.

648
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,380
 And so if he moves into your life, he takes up all of it.

649
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,660
 There is no space for anyone else.

650
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,740
 Jesus is not hoping to have a roommate in your heart

651
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,260
 that he shares with.

652
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,500
 It's either Jesus or it's the other person, right?

653
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,980
 He's too big for that.

654
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,180
 James chapter four, the message version

655
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,300
 reads it really, really well.

656
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,480
 I'm just gonna read it to you.

657
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,580
 So take a minute.

658
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,700
 It's not gonna be on the screen.

659
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,540
 You have to really listen.

660
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,180
 And it says like this.

661
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,380
 You are cheating on God if all you want is your way,

662
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,980
 flirting with the world every chance you get.

663
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,080
 You end up as enemies of God and his ways.

664
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,620
 And do you suppose God doesn't care?

665
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:01,660
 The proverb has it that he is a fiercely jealous lover.

666
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,300
 And this is the best part.

667
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,140
 And what he gives, what he offers,

668
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,820
 the way of the father is far better

669
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,680
 than anything else you'll ever find.

670
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,820
 That's the kicker.

671
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,500
 That's the kicker.

672
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,500
 Our tendency is pairing.

673
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,340
 It's pairing.

674
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,500
 It's Christ and something.

675
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,600
 Christ and intimacy with this.

676
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,860
 Christ and fill in the blanks.

677
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,860
 So Christ and success maybe for some of us.

678
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,380
 Christ and validation.

679
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,380
 Christ and relevance.

680
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,520
 Christ and creativity.

681
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,800
 Christ and security.

682
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,740
 Christ and blessings.

683
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,120
 Christ and, but I think it's supposed to be Christ alone.

684
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,760
 Christ alone, not Christ and stuff.

685
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,280
 Christ and things.

686
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,600
 We will find ourselves settling for the idea of Jesus

687
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,660
 if we are trying to pair him with something,

688
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,420
 never really getting to him itself.

689
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,180
 And so I think when you look at a message like this,

690
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,700
 I'm oftentimes cautious.

691
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,320
 I don't ever wanna come across as,

692
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,520
 Promise has read all this stuff

693
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,740
 and his life is like perfect now,

694
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,540
 so he's telling you guys, get your act together.

695
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,520
 That's not the case.

696
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,620
 Couldn't be further from the truth.

697
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,960
 I am just as broken as everyone else.

698
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,160
 So I wanted to share because Christ and fill in the blank

699
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,400
 can be maybe too broad for you.

700
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,320
 So let me share what it is for me.

701
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,600
 What is my Christ and that I struggle with every single day?

702
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,100
 For me, it's Christ and control.

703
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,680
 I wanna control my life.

704
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,400
 I wanna have a say in what I do.

705
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,980
 I wanna, I was telling Tony,

706
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,620
 I like to plan out what I'm gonna do every decade.

707
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,620
 At 30, I'm gonna have a master's and have my first kid.

708
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,900
 In my 40s, I'm gonna start my PhD.

709
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,160
 In my 50s, I'm gonna be a professor.

710
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,500
 In my 60s, I'm gonna write a book.

711
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,940
 Like I have it all planned out.

712
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,780
 I've written it out.

713
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,360
 It's a beautiful chart, it's an Excel sheet.

714
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,260
 I know what to do.

715
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,900
 Christ and controls for me.

716
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,740
 But this is the reason

717
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,760
 because I don't wanna depend on nobody else.

718
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,020
 Right, I have a sad story too.

719
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,760
 I came from a messed up situation too.

720
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,600
 I know what it's like to not have anything.

721
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,820
 I wanna make sure I earn enough.

722
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,660
 So it's me having to give myself the independence

723
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,700
 to make sure I earn enough,

724
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,720
 to make sure I have the right job,

725
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,300
 to make sure that my kids are fed

726
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,980
 and make sure my wife goes without need.

727
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,100
 I struggle with letting God have control.

728
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,420
 And some of my closest friends will tell you

729
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,660
 that's the one thing they pray for me all the time.

730
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,500
 I just can't let it go.

731
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 I really, really struggle.

732
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,540
 For me, it's always pairing the idea of Christ.

733
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,700
 I wanna be a good Christian.

734
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,980
 I wanna be intimate with God.

735
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,900
 But also I really wanna have control

736
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,220
 and have a say in how things turn out

737
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,220
 and make sure my life isn't a complete mess.

738
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,500
 I pair them together and Christ has been convicting me

739
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,700
 that rather than pairing my control with Christ,

740
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,200
 I'm supposed to be submitting,

741
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,120
 submitting my control to Christ.

742
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,900
 This is the thing, these objects,

743
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,660
 these concepts aren't bad in and of themselves.

744
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,740
 God didn't just create these things

745
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,680
 and said it's just a bunch of bad things in the world.

746
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,760
 No, there's a lot of good out here.

747
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,300
 But the problem that we potentially have,

748
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,460
 the tendency that we have is to pair together things

749
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,620
 when things are supposed to be submitted.

750
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:12,260
 And so I ask you, but that's my story, that's my reality.

751
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,660
 And maybe it's same for some of you, but what is it?

752
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,180
 What are the things, if you were to really ask yourself,

753
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,900
 what am I pairing with Jesus

754
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,660
 that I'm supposed to be submitting to Jesus?

755
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,660
 What good is there out there that I like

756
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,500
 that I've actually accidentally put at the same level

757
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,340
 or made an idol of or become more intimate with?

758
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,180
 And it's pushing out Jesus day in and day out.

759
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,380
 It is wearing me out.

760
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,580
 It is exhausting to try and juggle both

761
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,200
 because it's not possible.

762
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,260
 For some of us, not on scripts,

763
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,000
 for some of us, it's within relationships.

764
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,820
 And I really, I prayed about it this morning.

765
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,500
 I really felt I was supposed to share it at the 11 o'clock,

766
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,940
 so bear with me.

767
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,900
 If there is a relationship in your life

768
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,260
 where you are putting that person

769
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,780
 at the same level of Jesus,

770
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,000
 let me explain why it doesn't work.

771
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,700
 Because only God can satisfy fully.

772
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,620
 Only God can fulfill.

773
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,380
 So what we end up doing isn't just hurting ourselves.

774
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,760
 We actually end up hurting that person.

775
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,200
 We put God-like expectations on them to satisfy

776
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,780
 and make us feel or make us be a certain way

777
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,580
 when that can only be found in God.

778
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,400
 And that's not a rebuke.

779
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,240
 That's clarity.

780
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,700
 All right?

781
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,580
 The Father reveals these things that we might change,

782
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,820
 that we might turn away.

783
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,380
 So if that is you, I ask you to wrestle with it for a bit.

784
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,220
 You know, what is it?

785
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,040
 Maybe that's not you.

786
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,860
 Maybe it's something else.

787
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,580
 But we all have this temptation,

788
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,260
 and that ends up thwarting our intimacy

789
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,780
 away from walking closely with Christ

790
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,020
 and instead being intimate with other things.

791
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,460
 So I recognize this is a challenging,

792
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,800
 not even challenging,

793
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,780
 it's a very black and white sermon.

794
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,860
 Very strong worded, maybe.

795
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,860
 So I never wanna end on a negative.

796
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,040
 So I wanna offer us some thoughts, some ways,

797
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,340
 because the scriptures are so good.

798
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,660
 Like, God doesn't just tell us,

799
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,420
 "Oh, don't do this," and then like disappears.

800
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,380
 He actually leads us to a place

801
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,100
 of greater intimacy with him.

802
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,320
 So I wanna provide us two, I won't say simple,

803
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,500
 but hopefully simple to remember, steps.

804
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,160
 Some two things that we can do

805
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,540
 that will help us better choose

806
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,780
 where we're gonna be intimate,

807
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,380
 who we're gonna be intimate with.

808
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,620
 Is that okay?

809
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,680
 First thing is this.

810
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,220
 It begins by recognizing transformation over conformity.

811
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,580
 There's a passage in Romans 12

812
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,340
 that tells us not to conform

813
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,740
 to the patterns of this world.

814
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,020
 The patterns, the ideas, the systems,

815
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,220
 the structures, the way that the world operates.

816
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,700
 To not conform to that,

817
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,380
 but through the renewing of our minds

818
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,340
 to then be transformed.

819
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,400
 The renewing of our minds.

820
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,660
 Do not conform to the world.

821
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,880
 Live in the world, be in the world.

822
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,760
 Don't be of the world.

823
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,560
 That's what that verse is saying.

824
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,680
 My second thing is this.

825
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,800
 I share a quick story before I tell you this point.

826
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,000
 Last Sunday, I was listening to Pastor Andrew preach,

827
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,040
 and I was like, he got to his,

828
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,000
 I don't know, his deliverables or his action points, right?

829
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,080
 'Cause every good pastor has like an action point.

830
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,520
 And one of his action points was,

831
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,000
 my favorite passage in scripture from Matthew chapter six.

832
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,880
 It's the idea of seeking first the kingdom.

833
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,360
 And I was so annoyed knowing that's what I'm after.

834
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,400
 I'm like, Andrew, you stole my point for next week.

835
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,240
 He laughed and he hugged me.

836
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,160
 He goes, preach it anyways.

837
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,280
 Here's the thing.

838
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,680
 We're not saying it twice because we just want to repeat it.

839
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,380
 We're saying it twice because we want you to actually do it.

840
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,320
 Like this is super important.

841
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,640
 The idea of God-centered priorities

842
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,540
 will change everything for us.

843
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,760
 It will change everything for us.

844
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,180
 Matthew tells us to seek first, first, the first thing,

845
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,880
 the most important thing, the thing of most value,

846
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,400
 the thing of highest worth.

847
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,920
 Seek first his kingdom.

848
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,000
 He's defining for us what we should think

849
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,880
 and how we should believe and how we should live.

850
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,760
 Seek first the kingdom.

851
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,720
 And he doesn't say ignore everything else.

852
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,620
 He doesn't say, oh, well, we'll see what happens.

853
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,920
 Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.

854
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,480
 And all these things.

855
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,260
 Where promises kids go to school,

856
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,600
 how much money is in promises account,

857
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,540
 promises wife and family being in America,

858
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,160
 but me living in Hong Kong and missing Christmas

859
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,300
 for 10 years in a row.

860
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,760
 All the things that are hard.

861
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,920
 He says, seek first my kingdom.

862
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,260
 Seek first my kingdom promise

863
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,180
 and I will take care of everything else.

864
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,760
 He doesn't tell me how he's gonna do it.

865
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,600
 He doesn't say here are my four steps.

866
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,720
 Here's a PowerPoint, go look at it.

867
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,800
 But he invites me to trust him.

868
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,120
 And in that invitation of trust is perhaps

869
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,320
 a beautiful invitation to intimacy with God.

870
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,600
 Seek first his kingdom.

871
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,120
 I know there's a lot to process.

872
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,940
 I know there's a lot of things in here,

873
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,080
 but I really want us to, I guess,

874
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,360
 leave today encouraged and hopeful.

875
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:13,280
 Because if we grasp what intimacy is,

876
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,800
 if we can fall in love with the idea of being connected,

877
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,200
 being aligned, being in a God who speaks,

878
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,560
 who listens, who walks with you through every trial

879
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,880
 and who does not give you temptations,

880
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,420
 you cannot handle, who is your ever present help,

881
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,100
 who is your rock and your strong tower,

882
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,000
 who is the rock of your salvation,

883
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,400
 if we can understand intimacy with that,

884
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,380
 I believe it'll make us rethink our allegiances.

885
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,760
 If we can know that intimacy with God

886
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,200
 means I can choose peace.

887
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,360
 I don't have to worry about the things.

888
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,840
 He actually tells me don't worry about it at all.

889
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,000
 Don't be anxious for anything.

890
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,680
 Two different places, Matthew and James,

891
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,800
 made it real clear, don't be anxious.

892
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,200
 Just leave it up to him.

893
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,840
 Intimacy with God, choosing intimacy with God.

894
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,200
 Because the world will say worry about it,

895
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,880
 plan, plan, plan, get your spreadsheets,

896
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,000
 do your homework, prepare yourself, prepare yourself.

897
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,540
 God's saying don't be anxious.

898
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,520
 To be a Christian means to walk through this

899
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,640
 without anxiety, right?

900
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,540
 To live and there's things happening,

901
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,640
 but to not be shaken.

902
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,000
 Because our house isn't built on the sand.

903
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,200
 It's not built on what is important and popular in 2024,

904
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,840
 that'll probably be different in 2025

905
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
 and different in 2028.

906
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,720
 It's not based off of popular psychology

907
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,300
 or pseudo psychology or whatever magazine we're reading,

908
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,160
 whatever the news tells us,

909
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,880
 because our hope is built on Christ

910
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,000
 and he's an unshakable rock.

911
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,800
 That position is available for you.

912
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
 This is a,

913
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,540
 (sighs)

914
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,880
 this passage is a call for us to come back.

915
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,060
 It's a call for us to recognize that we're human,

916
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,040
 we made mistakes, it's okay, but there's a way back.

917
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,560
 So as the band comes up, I want to end with the reality

918
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,880
 of one of my favorite passages,

919
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,760
 one of my favorite parables in scripture.

920
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,060
 It's the parable of the two sons, right?

921
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,420
 I think it was somewhat familiar to some of us,

922
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,380
 but the idea is that these two sons have a father.

923
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,860
 One son gets his inheritance early, dips out,

924
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,920
 and he runs to the world.

925
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,520
 How fitting, fits right in.

926
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,920
 It's almost like I planned it.

927
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,620
 He goes out to the world and he squanders his wealth

928
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,180
 and he does his thing and he lives his life.

929
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,700
 And let's say he makes quite a few mistakes

930
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,160
 to where he's dirt poor, can't eat, has nowhere to sleep.

931
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,300
 He's messed it up and the thought goes

932
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,540
 through his head one day,

933
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,260
 rather than living here in the pigsty

934
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,540
 and just being cold and dirty and hungry and not clothed,

935
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,940
 maybe I can go back to my father

936
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,280
 and maybe he will at least allow me to be a servant

937
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,220
 in his house and take care of like the cattle or something.

938
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,940
 And so he musters up the courage to go back to his father.

939
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,420
 And on his way to his father, his father sees him,

940
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,860
 and perhaps one of the most beautiful things,

941
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:53,260
 he disrobes so that there is nothing holding him back,

942
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,060
 nothing resisting him from sprinting

943
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,780
 to his son that he loves.

944
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,740
 It doesn't matter that he's messed up.

945
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,620
 It doesn't matter that he's chosen the world over the father.

946
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,540
 The father drops everything.

947
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,620
 He runs and he hugs him and he welcomes him.

948
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,860
 He doesn't reject him.

949
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,620
 Doesn't say you dirty sinner.

950
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,300
 He welcomes him in.

951
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,740
 He loves him.

952
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,220
 It's such a story of love.

953
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,900
 He takes his coat and he puts it on him.

954
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,220
 He takes his ring and puts it back on him

955
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,940
 to let him know that you're not just gonna be

956
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,000
 someone taking care of my cattle.

957
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,180
 No, you're my family.

958
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,940
 You're with me.

959
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,860
 I still wanna be intimate with you.

960
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,860
 And perhaps there are some of us who are curious

961
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,820
 about what that road looks like back to the father.

962
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,500
 Can I just encourage you that the father's arms

963
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,940
 are open wide, that he's a father that welcomes us back.

964
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,040
 He welcomes the vulnerable.

965
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,460
 Says that if we are faithful enough to confess our sins,

966
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,700
 he is faithful and just to forgive us and restore us.

967
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,660
 We kept singing he makes all things new.

968
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,660
 He makes, we wrote that on purpose, y'all.

969
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,500
 Like that is the truth of who he is.

970
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,700
 He will make you new, but will you be open?

971
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,100
 Will you be open?

972
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,820
 And so I wanna pray for us.

973
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,980
 So if we can all just go ahead and stand.

974
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,820
 We'll just take a moment

975
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,020
 and we will just come to the father together.

976
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:27,460
 If this message hits anything for you,

977
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,020
 whether it's about priorities or about allegiances

978
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,620
 or about your intimacy or about the pairing,

979
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,400
 can I just ask you to open your hands?

980
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,220
 As a symbol, not for me, not for your neighbor,

981
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,780
 but this is a moment between you and God.

982
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,820
 If there's something here that you feel like

983
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,280
 I need to do with God, I need to speak with God,

984
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,780
 just open your hands.

985
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:54,380
 And Holy Spirit, as we sit here under your word,

986
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,540
 under your truth and your clarity,

987
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,960
 but also under your grace and forgiveness,

988
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,940
 God, we open our hands symbolically to say

989
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,340
 that we've messed up, that there's been moments,

990
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,820
 there are things that vie for our affections

991
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,940
 and our intentions.

992
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,020
 We open our hands to say, God, we're open.

993
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,820
 Could you please come?

994
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,020
 Would you please enter?

995
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,980
 Would you please come to meet us?

996
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,660
 We know that your arms are open, Father.

997
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,560
 We know that the road back to you is one

998
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,180
 where you welcome us and that you love us,

999
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,140
 that you call us your own,

1000
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,260
 that you call us sons and daughters, your family.

1001
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,980
 God, so I just pray against any lie

1002
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,180
 that's in anyone's head now.

1003
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,020
 Any voice that says, no, no, no, no, no.

1004
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,740
 Will God actually accept you?

1005
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,480
 Will God actually respond to you?

1006
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,720
 Any seeds of doubt that are flowing through this place,

1007
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,040
 we rebuke them.

1008
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,020
 But instead we speak your truth, we speak your grace,

1009
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,740
 we speak your mercies that are new.

1010
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,340
 Every single morning, we speak your steadfast love

1011
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,980
 over your people that leads us back

1012
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,560
 to a place of intimacy with you.

1013
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,460
 And God, Holy Spirit, would you begin to remind us

1014
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,460
 and show us what it means to be intimate

1015
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,540
 with the creator of the heavens and the earth,

1016
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,620
 the creators of us?

1017
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,100
 God, would you draw us in?

1018
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,340
 Would you hold us close?

1019
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,060
 Would you give us the fortitude and the courage

1020
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,100
 to continue taking a step towards you,

1021
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,100
 forsaking everything else?

1022
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,940
 Because you are better, because you are better.

1023
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,340
 We give you glory for this in Jesus' name, amen.

1024
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,760
 (soft music)

1025
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,340
 (gentle music)
