1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
 >> The Lord as he preaches here today,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,800
 we just pray that your spirit would just meet him,

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,520
 just help him to feel at home here and speak to him.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,920
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,840
 Everyone says.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,680
 >> Amen. >> Amen.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,500
 >> Thank you, Andrew.

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,400
 Good morning, how's everyone doing?

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560
 Upper house, you all right?

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,360
 All right.

11
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,560
 Hey, so if you are just joining us,

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,800
 we are in a season of Uncharted.

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,080
 Not meaning that we don't know what we're doing,

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,240
 but in a way, not knowing what God is gonna do in our midst.

15
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,000
 And we are also in a series of about the Holy Spirit.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 And if you've kind of missed the last few weeks,

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,680
 let me bring you up to speed quickly.

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,560
 In the last few weeks,

19
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,960
 we've learned that the Holy Spirit is a person,

20
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,520
 not a force that we just call upon anytime we want.

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,120
 But the Holy Spirit dwells within each of us

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,120
 to restore and to reorder, to heal and also to comfort us,

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,600
 and also to teach and illuminate the truth of who God is,

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,280
 so that in our most trivial, difficult times,

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,520
 we can come to experience Him.

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,240
 And so for all of us who yearn

27
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,760
 for the work of the Spirit in our life,

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,920
 it requires a willingness and a surrenderedness

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,980
 to want to actually hear what God wants to say.

30
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,200
 Today, we continue to focus on the Holy Spirit,

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,800
 but more so on the importance of the Spirit's work

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,200
 in both our personal faith,

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,280
 but also our communal faith as the Vine Church.

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,280
 Looking back on my faith journey,

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,000
 which I had some time to do this week,

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,680
 as a new Christian when I was 16,

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,080
 I remember how much I needed the Spirit of God

38
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,440
 to lead me, to guide me, to teach me

39
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,920
 in how to be a good person, a better person,

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,080
 but also to teach me in the Word.

41
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,080
 And when I think back to God's constant presence in my life,

42
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,200
 I could also think about the people who walked with me,

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,520
 the community that was with me.

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
 I want to show you a photo here.

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,640
 You're not gonna recognize me,

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
 but this was me when I was 16.

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,820
 This was the day of my baptism,

48
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,080
 and these boys, we called ourselves the Joy Luck Boys.

49
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,420
 Don't ask, I'll, I won't explain it here.

50
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,160
 But these boys taught me everything I know,

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,080
 the foundation they gave me

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,640
 of what it means to be a good friend,

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
 what it means to fellowship,

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,720
 what it means to be in the Word.

55
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,680
 And I think one of the most special things

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
 that we have back then is we had so much time.

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,880
 We would spend three, four hours in the Word every week

58
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,280
 together as 16-year-olds,

59
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,080
 which I don't know if that's common,

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
 but it was just life-changing.

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,480
 And so to this day, I keep in touch with these boys.

62
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,440
 Recently, I met up with a few of them

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,800
 who came through Hong Kong.

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
 And as I grew a few more years older in my 20s,

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,000
 here at the Vine, in the young adults community,

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,560
 I recall that most of my growth came primarily

67
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,840
 from encountering God's holy presence

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,800
 with a lot of you here in this room, actually.

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,440
 Every week, the intimate but yet public manifestation

70
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,000
 of God's Spirit brought us to our knees.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,780
 We were just crying out for God.

72
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,240
 We wanted more because we were so profoundly changed.

73
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,720
 I'm gonna show you two photos.

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,880
 Don't judge me.

75
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,200
 This was pre-iPhone.

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,080
 This was when we had digital cameras.

77
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,840
 Doesn't matter whether these photos are great or not,

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,960
 but they represent a desperation.

79
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,800
 They represented the hunger and the thirst that we had

80
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,720
 actually, I was so scared of coming to church

81
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,480
 every single week, including a Sunday,

82
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,240
 'cause I was scared God would say something.

83
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,380
 And every week, he wrecked us.

84
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,000
 But at the same time, we couldn't imagine life

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
 without God showing up.

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,920
 And so when we think back, maybe it was that simple.

87
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,720
 It was just really being in God's presence with one another.

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,880
 And so in more recent years, this was actually quite recent.

89
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,480
 This was at our last prayer meeting,

90
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,720
 which we're also having on June 3rd.

91
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,520
 I've come to recognize that if we want to mature,

92
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,520
 then we have to have a balance of personal time with God,

93
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,780
 the times that we reflect and seek God and be in his word.

94
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,560
 But at the same time, I desire so much more these days

95
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,400
 to also just to serve with you, to worship with you,

96
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,500
 to seek God together.

97
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,340
 And what changes us, I think, is God's presence amongst us.

98
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,700
 And we can testify to this, yes?

99
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,400
 The reason why I think we need to do this

100
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,680
 is so that we don't become isolated,

101
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,180
 so that we can continue to be outward-looking.

102
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,440
 And this is the life that scripture actually calls us to.

103
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,680
 This is our normal.

104
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,080
 This should be the normal in which we try to live in.

105
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,720
 And I cannot imagine life without you guys.

106
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,200
 I cannot imagine being at another church,

107
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,880
 worshiping and doing the things that we get to do.

108
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,060
 And so I can comprehend now that our spiritual reality,

109
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,600
 our starting point, is that as Christians,

110
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,360
 we have to recognize that the spirit of God

111
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,740
 works in both contexts of our spiritual,

112
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,320
 our personal faith, but also our times together.

113
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,880
 Meaning that God is able and can and does speak to us

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,620
 passionately, longingly, faithfully,

115
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,280
 as much on a Monday as it is on a Sunday.

116
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,460
 Even though this is ideal, this is what we want,

117
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,900
 this doesn't always happen.

118
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,300
 What gets in the way?

119
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,340
 Can you guess what gets in the way, guys?

120
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,840
 Well, life, but also us.

121
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,060
 We get in the way.

122
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,940
 As Christians, we have this very human tendency

123
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,440
 to emphasize one expense at the expense of the other.

124
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,220
 So if left to our own choosing,

125
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,500
 if left to our own preferences,

126
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,260
 what happens is that sometimes,

127
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,560
 because we have such a passion for the work

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,140
 of the Holy Spirit in our own lives,

129
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,340
 sometimes when we come here to worship together,

130
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,820
 we're not as bothered.

131
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,020
 We're not as focused or leaning into this.

132
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,500
 But equally, at times, we can so focus,

133
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,540
 we can so focus on encountering God here

134
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,000
 that from Monday to Saturday, we're just like, eh,

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,500
 you know, I'm just gonna come back on a Sunday.

136
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,660
 So I wonder, and I wanna wonder with you guys today,

137
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,700
 why do we expect the spirit to come

138
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,920
 in one of these situations and not always both?

139
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,860
 Or put another way, why do some of us

140
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,940
 only experience God in one context and not the other?

141
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,180
 Are you tracking with me?

142
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,220
 So in preparing today, I had a sense that though,

143
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,140
 yes, there is a discrepancy

144
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,960
 between our actual lived realities many times,

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,980
 but what I want to bring for us today

146
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,460
 is to think about how our expectations

147
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,680
 and our preferences of the Holy Spirit

148
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,500
 can actually limit His work in our private life,

149
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,360
 but also when we gather like this.

150
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,100
 So I wanna ask you, when you open up God's word today,

151
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,740
 when you open up God's word at home,

152
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,300
 which I know you guys do,

153
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,420
 do you carry the same anticipation,

154
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,860
 the same expectation that you have on a Sunday

155
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,620
 that the Spirit of God will surely show up

156
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,000
 and move and change you?

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,340
 Likewise, when we gather like this,

158
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,620
 like on a Sunday in our community groups

159
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,740
 throughout the week, do you believe

160
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,300
 that God can speak personally to you

161
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,300
 as He does when you are spending time one-on-one with Him?

162
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,820
 The central question that I think a lot of us ask

163
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,300
 that I want to explore with us today

164
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,020
 is why can't I sense or know God's presence

165
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,140
 at home or at work like I do at the Vine?

166
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,040
 Is it possible to experience the Spirit

167
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,840
 in both our private and our communal life?

168
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,660
 Today, I want to explore this tension,

169
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,540
 this question through a passage in 1 Peter.

170
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,740
 I'm gonna offer you three points of consideration.

171
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,160
 I'm gonna list out three factors

172
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,980
 that limit and stifle and hinders

173
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,500
 the Spirit's work in our lives together and alone.

174
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,540
 These factors have everything to do with how we relate

175
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,300
 and how we understand the Father, the Son,

176
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,660
 and especially the Spirit.

177
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,980
 So I'm gonna read, and you can,

178
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,300
 please, I ask you to read with me.

179
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,980
 I'll be reading from the NSRV.

180
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,460
 1 Peter 4:7-11 says,

181
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,820
 "The end of all things is near.

182
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,920
 "Therefore be serious and discipline yourselves

183
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,520
 "for the sake of your prayers.

184
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,480
 "Above all, maintain constant love for one another,

185
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,340
 "for love covers a multitude of sins.

186
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,480
 "Be hospitable to one another without complaining.

187
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,420
 "Like good stewards of the manifold grace of God,

188
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,600
 "serve one another with whatever gift

189
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,360
 "each of you have received.

190
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,160
 "Whoever speaks must do so

191
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,240
 "once speaking the very words of God.

192
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,940
 "Whoever serves must do so

193
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,620
 "with the strength that God supplies

194
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,700
 "so that God may be glorified

195
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,020
 "in all things through Jesus Christ.

196
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,260
 "To Him belong the glory and the power

197
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,500
 "forever and ever, amen."

198
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,900
 At first glance, this passage, you're thinking,

199
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,580
 what does this have to do with it?

200
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,260
 But I ask you just to trek with me, okay?

201
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,060
 Peter here paints a very broad picture

202
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,920
 of life in the early church.

203
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,880
 Peter was encouraging the church

204
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,880
 to remain steadfast in their love for one another,

205
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,100
 to keep praying, to be vigilant amidst persecution.

206
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,100
 And they had a shared urgency at the church,

207
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,940
 in the church that Jesus would return soon.

208
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,320
 So there was that much more need

209
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,060
 to continue to host each other, continue to love and pray.

210
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,780
 We're gonna pick up at verse nine.

211
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,320
 And as we go through this passage,

212
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,900
 I want you to once again think about,

213
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,620
 is it possible for you and I to experience the spirit

214
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,880
 in both our life and our times here together?

215
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,980
 Verse nine says, "Be hospitable to one another

216
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
 "without complaining."

217
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,500
 Peter suggests that one of the ways

218
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,100
 that Christians can demonstrate their love

219
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,740
 in a tangible way is to practice hospitality

220
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,420
 without complaining.

221
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,540
 For Peter and the early church, as well as for Jesus,

222
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,020
 hospitality was a tremendous privilege

223
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,820
 to express welcome to the stranger, to the believer,

224
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,700
 not just through food or lodging, but as an embrace,

225
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,480
 as an all out embrace of your inner person

226
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,940
 for the other person who is coming into your home.

227
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,380
 And so in the ancient world,

228
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,580
 this was a cultural expectation

229
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,180
 and also obligation to offer hospitality.

230
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,140
 Scriptures like Acts 14, Hebrews 13 say

231
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,900
 that some have entertained angels

232
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,580
 while having a stranger in their house.

233
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,860
 Likewise in Matthew 25, Jesus says that by extending

234
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,460
 kindness to a stranger, to extend kindness

235
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,980
 to the least of these, as in someone who has a need,

236
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:54,620
 is like that it's equaled and akin to welcoming

237
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,180
 the Lord himself, which is quite an incredible thought

238
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,600
 to begin with.

239
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,900
 And Jesus says that no matter how slight,

240
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,640
 how small your act of kindness is,

241
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,620
 it will not go unrewarded.

242
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,200
 So how is this relevant?

243
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,320
 Let me tell you, while hospitality is an essential practice,

244
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,160
 it's an obligation, it's a privilege,

245
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,560
 it is difficult because hospitality requires us

246
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,160
 to inconvenience ourselves, right?

247
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,160
 It requires extra effort to welcome someone into your home,

248
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,580
 especially unexpectedly.

249
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,920
 But church, what if the person we are hosting every day,

250
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,520
 every week is the Holy Spirit himself?

251
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,520
 Would we not make that extra effort?

252
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,880
 Would we not be too bothered about being inconvenienced

253
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,720
 with our scheduling and what we have to do?

254
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,640
 And so church, I want to just bluntly

255
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,340
 and just openly put it before you,

256
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,320
 that if we want to experience the Spirit

257
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,360
 in both our private life and our communal life,

258
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,520
 then the concept of hospitality here

259
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,520
 is to hold an intentional awareness

260
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,880
 that every time we meet like this,

261
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,960
 every time I come to God's word, we are welcoming,

262
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,340
 we are hosting the Holy Spirit.

263
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:18,720
 Not just in our time together, but in our thought life,

264
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,120
 in the way we think about others, we are saying,

265
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,920
 "Lord, help me to think through my day.

266
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,160
 Help me to think through these relationships

267
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,960
 because I want to serve you in it."

268
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,160
 And so it doesn't matter suddenly where we are physically,

269
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,620
 because if the Holy Spirit is with us, wherever we go,

270
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,680
 we can host him and welcome him anywhere.

271
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,360
 And so what I want to suggest is maybe every time we,

272
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,560
 before we come here, before we pray at home,

273
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,720
 before meal times, we can pray something like this.

274
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,640
 We can say, "Holy Spirit, you are welcome here.

275
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,860
 You're welcome in this place.

276
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,040
 And we ask you to stay with us

277
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,560
 because we want to serve you.

278
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,980
 We've been waiting for you.

279
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,800
 We want to just sit down with you

280
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,080
 and hear everything you have to say to us."

281
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,500
 It's maybe as simple as that.

282
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,520
 But if this is our collective prayer,

283
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,680
 what if this was our collective prayer,

284
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,760
 then would we not be able to experience

285
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,280
 the Holy Spirit a little more?

286
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,680
 I want to now continue in verse 10 and 11.

287
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,200
 Peter says, "Like good stewards of the manifold grace of God

288
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,560
 serve one another with whatever gift

289
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,800
 each of you has received."

290
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,020
 We'll come back to that.

291
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,800
 "Whoever speaks must do so

292
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,240
 as one speaking the very words of God.

293
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,560
 Whoever serves must do so with the strength

294
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,840
 that God supplies so that God may be glorified

295
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,380
 in all things through Jesus Christ."

296
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,840
 Peter reminds us that if you and I are serious

297
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,760
 about following him,

298
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,400
 then we have to find our place in the body of Christ.

299
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,920
 We have to come to recognize what gift

300
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,240
 the Holy Spirit has given each of us

301
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,960
 so that we can build up the church,

302
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,740
 so that we can serve one another.

303
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,120
 Peter here says, "Whether you're alone

304
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,520
 or whether you're together,

305
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,480
 I want you to be diligent and faithful stewards

306
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,800
 of whatever God has gifting you with,

307
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,640
 whatever resource he has given you,

308
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,320
 the time that you have available."

309
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,600
 Peter's saying, "By God's grace

310
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,440
 and the strength he has given you,

311
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,800
 use this gift to build and encourage one another

312
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,680
 because our time here is limited."

313
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,080
 And so when Peter calls us to be good stewards,

314
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,480
 he means that what we've been given,

315
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,280
 which is not ours to begin with, use it generously.

316
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,240
 Use it not for selfish gain,

317
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,400
 but think about the other person.

318
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,680
 Because our starting point, as Peter here says,

319
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,680
 is all of us have received the manifold grace of God.

320
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,160
 And as in all of us have been transformed by God's grace.

321
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,080
 And as a way of saying, "Thank you, Lord,"

322
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,400
 as a way of our rightful worship,

323
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,100
 our reasonable worship, as it says in Romans 12,

324
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,240
 we have to discern and figure out our place in this body,

325
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,960
 in this family, in this home,

326
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,840
 so that we can be outward looking,

327
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,120
 so that we can bless others,

328
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,920
 so that God's spirit can work through us.

329
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,960
 And so let me talk a bit about these gifts

330
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,280
 and give us a context.

331
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,240
 The scripture is not here,

332
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,600
 but you can write down 1 Corinthians 12,

333
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,080
 verse four to seven.

334
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,800
 The apostle Paul teaches us that the Holy Spirit

335
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,440
 gives different spiritual gifts to each of us,

336
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,760
 to every one of us,

337
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,740
 so that we can contribute and fulfill

338
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,580
 and find our place here.

339
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,320
 And so I would like to remind us,

340
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,840
 'cause sometimes I forget,

341
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,520
 that the health of this church

342
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,040
 does not rest on Andrew's shoulders.

343
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,120
 It does not rest on the pastors alone.

344
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,640
 It does not fall to our community leaders,

345
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,080
 our volunteers, our worship team,

346
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,680
 even our production team,

347
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,280
 but it's all of us need to figure out our place,

348
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,080
 so that the Vine Church and whatever church

349
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,860
 that you are a part of can be healthy and thriving.

350
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,600
 And so I wanna talk about these gifts.

351
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,540
 Once again, I don't have time to quote every scripture,

352
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,080
 but in the New Testament,

353
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,260
 the spirit gives us, the believers,

354
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,580
 the ability to teach, to minister, as in to serve,

355
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,880
 to evangelize, to tell people about Jesus,

356
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,280
 to pastor, to offer leadership,

357
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,020
 to encourage, to prophesy.

358
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,660
 Prophesy, we talked about this last week.

359
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,420
 It's not future telling.

360
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,580
 It's calling and helping us realize the reality,

361
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,860
 our spiritual reality,

362
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,480
 the truth of who God is already revealed.

363
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,420
 And he's called some of us to admonish.

364
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,760
 He's called some of us to correct the church

365
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,800
 in grace and truth, but in love and gentleness.

366
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,620
 Some are called to serve, to express hospitality,

367
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,800
 to show mercy and generosity.

368
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,940
 Church, if we desire to experience the spirit in our life

369
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,360
 and as well as in our gathering,

370
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,840
 then we have to be aware of the reality

371
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,880
 that we're given gifts, not for our own self,

372
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,460
 but for the sake of others.

373
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,960
 And as we serve, as we give,

374
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,280
 God shows up in unexpected and beautiful

375
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,560
 and life-changing ways.

376
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,440
 So where do we start?

377
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,600
 Well, let me start personally.

378
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,000
 Personally, I would love for you to go home

379
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,700
 and to look up every spiritual gift

380
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,440
 and ask the spirit of God to show you what he's given you,

381
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,680
 if you don't know already,

382
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,000
 and ask him for the opportunities to work it out.

383
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
 When you're at work, when you're at home with your family

384
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,960
 and you know how that dinner is gonna be,

385
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,320
 pray, "Lord, I wanna use my gift today.

386
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,040
 "I wanna bless my family, my colleagues."

387
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,460
 Communally, I think we have already started to do this.

388
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,480
 And it's just simple as once you know your gift, use it.

389
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,940
 And so I wanna give you some examples.

390
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,100
 We can definitely attend to the needs of the other person,

391
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,940
 which is a lot.

392
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,400
 All of us have needs.

393
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,000
 We can take someone out for coffee and pray with them.

394
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,880
 We can teach others how to love God, as my boys taught me,

395
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,300
 how to resist temptation, how to battle.

396
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,040
 I mean, I can list it, but I won't.

397
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,360
 We can show hospitality to those who can never pay us back.

398
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,080
 We can be a listening ear.

399
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,780
 We can write a letter of encouragement and comfort

400
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,660
 to those who are imprisoned, who are suffering.

401
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,880
 We can sit with those who are grieving loss.

402
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,200
 We can extend the same mercy that we've received from God

403
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
 by forgiving those who've hurt us.

404
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,040
 And so if you are tracking with me right now,

405
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,600
 if we are serious about walking this out

406
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,120
 and learning how to walk this out,

407
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,280
 then I wanna remind us of something,

408
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,280
 that our Christian faith is not meant to be a depository

409
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,720
 of God's grace, but rather we as the church

410
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,360
 are called to be channels in which God's grace,

411
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,400
 He blesses us, He changes us.

412
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,540
 It's supposed to flow through us.

413
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,040
 And I want us to really think about this today,

414
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,040
 because it's so easy, and I'm many times

415
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,800
 in this boat as well, that it's really easy

416
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,880
 to come to church or come to a small group,

417
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,400
 to come somewhere with the focus

418
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,040
 of just receiving for ourselves.

419
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,880
 And that is okay for a season.

420
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,840
 That is okay generally, but if it becomes an ingrained habit

421
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,700
 and that's the only way we're thinking,

422
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,360
 then I will say that bluntly, yes, we will limit,

423
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,940
 we will stifle the work of the spirit whenever we meet.

424
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,740
 And so the ultimate goal here for us

425
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,660
 when we're with God alone, when we come together like this,

426
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,000
 is say, Lord, I don't want to be a terminal

427
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,680
 in which your grace just stops with me.

428
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,580
 I want to figure out when I leave this place,

429
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,080
 when we part ways, Lord, would you continue

430
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,880
 to channel what I have received,

431
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,000
 and I want to share it with people.

432
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,640
 I want to pray it over people.

433
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,420
 I want to talk about it so that I don't forget

434
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,680
 what God is doing in our life.

435
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,600
 And so last week, I think, was a beautiful example of this.

436
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,680
 Actually, Pastor Andrew and Carla,

437
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,460
 they asked the staff to have words ready

438
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,260
 a few days before Sunday, so that when we come,

439
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,460
 we could share our words in faith

440
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,960
 that it's gonna speak to some of us.

441
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,720
 And I think it did speak to us,

442
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,340
 and as a result, Pastor Andrew called us

443
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,640
 to pray for each other, to bless each other,

444
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,640
 so that we can be channels.

445
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,700
 And this, I pray for more opportunities

446
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,560
 where we get to experience this and witness this,

447
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,120
 because this, honestly, church,

448
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,240
 is the normal Christian life.

449
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,480
 There is no other way.

450
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,360
 I had many seasons in my life where I was just,

451
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,800
 I mean, Patsy can attest to this,

452
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,840
 I would just go into my room, into my closet, lock myself,

453
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,000
 and I would not come out for hours,

454
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,960
 which is great, is a great practice,

455
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,840
 but I need to balance that out

456
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,360
 with sharing what God spoke to me

457
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,680
 in the closet for six hours, right?

458
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,480
 I know, it's easy to forget.

459
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,040
 It's easy to forget our role,

460
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,160
 the gift that we've been given,

461
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,620
 and that we are actually channels.

462
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,520
 So up 'til now, I'm doing pretty well.

463
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,040
 I have mentioned two factors that can limit

464
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,680
 and stifle our ability to experience the Spirit.

465
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,000
 One is our awareness.

466
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,060
 Are we willing to host the Spirit in our life,

467
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,240
 wherever we are?

468
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,640
 And two, are we willing to be channels

469
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,640
 in which God bestows and blesses through us and the church?

470
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,480
 The third factor that I want to raise up

471
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,860
 is something that has more to do with us individually,

472
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,960
 and how we ourselves can limit

473
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,040
 the work of the Spirit in our life.

474
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,320
 In 1 Thessalonians 5:19,

475
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,700
 Scripture warns us, "Do not quench the Holy Spirit."

476
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,900
 And so Paul is saying that whenever you meet,

477
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,600
 whenever you're gathering,

478
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,780
 I want you to be mindful of this,

479
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,080
 that you do not quench the Holy Spirit.

480
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,100
 And to be honest, I've always, up until last week,

481
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,220
 be very apprehensive about this verse.

482
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,380
 I was very intimidated.

483
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,860
 I don't actually want to find out the true context.

484
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,180
 But today, I want to share that,

485
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,020
 'cause it's quite mind-blowing.

486
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,100
 And so to quench the Spirit really is to limit Him.

487
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,940
 It's to prohibit Him from working in our life.

488
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,480
 It's to basically not give Him permission.

489
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,920
 Because as we've been talking about,

490
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,800
 if the Holy Spirit is a person,

491
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,560
 if Holy Spirit has feelings and has character,

492
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,740
 and He can be blessed and He can feel loved,

493
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,080
 then equally, the opposite can be true,

494
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,200
 that the Holy Spirit, because He has His own personality,

495
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,120
 He can be limited.

496
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,260
 He can be told to stay away.

497
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,740
 He can be grieved.

498
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,220
 So what quenches the Spirit for starters?

499
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,420
 Our sin, our selfishness, our inability,

500
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,980
 our unwillingness to listen sometimes intentionally,

501
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,380
 our lack of expectations when we show up.

502
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,820
 You know, sometimes we just ignore Him.

503
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,940
 One of the most hurtful things that I find

504
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,820
 is I go to a group, we're hanging out,

505
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,620
 everyone's on their phone, I'm trying to talk,

506
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,460
 and everyone's just ignoring me.

507
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,780
 And sometimes, many times,

508
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,100
 I think we do that to the Spirit.

509
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,560
 We do that to one another.

510
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:31,480
 Our idolatry, sometimes we make up these man-made rules

511
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,780
 to govern people when Jesus has given us everything

512
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,980
 in the Gospels in which we are to treat one another,

513
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,320
 to forgive and to bless and to uphold.

514
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,880
 And when we're together, what really grieves the Spirit,

515
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,040
 I think, is the way we talk about each other,

516
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,320
 the way we gossip, the way we slander, using our words.

517
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,200
 We sometimes, even it's not without our words,

518
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,160
 just in our coldness of not saying anything,

519
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,960
 the coldness that we express to one another,

520
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,760
 our contemptuous words, our unsympathetic criticism,

521
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,400
 and our blatant hypocrisy.

522
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,160
 I was reading in Scripture yesterday,

523
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,520
 hypocrisy, another way of thinking it,

524
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,920
 is flattering lips and also double-heartedness.

525
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,260
 You know, with one heart, I speak to you guys,

526
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,480
 but with another heart, I speak to you like this,

527
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,720
 and that is hypocritical.

528
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,040
 And I could go on, but I won't.

529
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,480
 And so I wanna say that, church,

530
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,160
 if we knowingly, right now, practice

531
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,200
 and know that we are doing these things to one another,

532
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,880
 we are okay with this, with God,

533
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,360
 then definitely we will stifle, we will limit His work.

534
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,720
 It's not that Holy Spirit cannot work through us,

535
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,400
 it's just there's no room.

536
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,880
 We're not giving Him room, we're not allowing Him,

537
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,840
 because these things hold us back

538
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,100
 from realizing that we need to address these things.

539
00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:01,320
 So I'm gonna come back to our bigger picture

540
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,560
 and what I started with today.

541
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,920
 The question that I think some of us have is,

542
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,360
 can I sense God's presence at home as I do at the Vine?

543
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,920
 Can I also encounter the Holy Spirit like I do on a Sunday,

544
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,140
 wherever I go?

545
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,560
 If I'm gonna go away this week,

546
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,000
 if I'm gonna do something, will the Holy Spirit be with me?

547
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,320
 So is it possible to experience the Spirit

548
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,280
 in both our private life, but also our communal life?

549
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,160
 The short answer is yes.

550
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,440
 It is very possible to experience the Spirit

551
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,440
 in both these contexts if we grow in our relational awareness

552
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,480
 to what the Father and the Son and the Spirit

553
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,840
 is doing at all times.

554
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,160
 And then maybe it just does begin

555
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,920
 with such a simple proclamation and a prayer to say,

556
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,840
 Holy Spirit, you are welcome here.

557
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,420
 Holy Spirit, you are welcome here.

558
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,600
 No matter what we've gone through,

559
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,320
 Lord, you are welcome here.

560
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,800
 Please just stay with us.

561
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,540
 And I hope in the days ahead that we'll remind ourselves

562
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,520
 of today's message.

563
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,920
 Because if we do not remind ourselves,

564
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,120
 if we ignore everything I've said, which I'm okay with,

565
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,280
 God will only seem that he is in one place at a time.

566
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,840
 And that is a tragedy.

567
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,340
 And so I just wanna summarize,

568
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,800
 and I wanna list out our points today,

569
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,120
 the things that I've brought up

570
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,480
 in a question form for you guys.

571
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,480
 The first question is, will you host and welcome the Spirit

572
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,080
 in your own life, but also when you gather together?

573
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,960
 Two, will you be channels to the Spirit's work

574
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,720
 rather than depositories?

575
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,160
 Will you allow God as you use the gifts to serve

576
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,680
 and to give trust in faith

577
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,420
 that God is using you in that moment?

578
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,520
 Many times we don't think God is using us,

579
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,160
 therefore we just don't even try, we just step back,

580
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
 oh, someone else would do it.

581
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,520
 But that's why so many of us burn out every year

582
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,220
 because it's only a few of us doing what a lot of us,

583
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,000
 all of us should be doing.

584
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,800
 You know, one day I really wanna experience that,

585
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,340
 all of us serving, all of us giving at the same time.

586
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,840
 It might be chaotic,

587
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,280
 but I think it'll be beautiful in a real way.

588
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,040
 So let's write that down as a life goal.

589
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,900
 Third thing is, will we quench the Spirit?

590
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,120
 The answer is yes, but what do we do about that?

591
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,960
 I want you to be aware.

592
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,880
 And so church, can I ask you to stand?

593
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,820
 I want to pray for us today, but before I do,

594
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,820
 I want you just maybe just to close your eyes

595
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,800
 or do whatever it is that helps you focus.

596
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,780
 And I'm just gonna speak to different groups right now

597
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,700
 before I pray.

598
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:47,180
 If you are the ones where you desire the Spirit

599
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,140
 to work in your personal life,

600
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,180
 then I want you to put up your hands and your heart.

601
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,420
 I want you just to say to the Lord, yeah, that's me.

602
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,340
 If you are also the ones that say, you know,

603
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,180
 I experienced you a lot in my personal life,

604
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,820
 but Lord, every time I come here, I'm so distracted.

605
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,480
 I just have all of these thoughts.

606
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,720
 Would you help me to connect with the wider church?

607
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,960
 Would you help me connect to what you're doing in our midst?

608
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,660
 If that is you, I also want you to open up your hands.

609
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:24,400
 If you are standing here today and sitting here today

610
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,360
 and you realize that, oh my gosh, God has given me gifts,

611
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,560
 I am now aware that I have a part in this house.

612
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,660
 Whether you're here for two weeks, a month,

613
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,700
 you've been here for years,

614
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,780
 you have a place here to serve, to give,

615
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,220
 because you are a channel in which the Holy Spirit moves.

616
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,340
 So if that is you and you realize this,

617
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,020
 or you say, you know, Justin, I want to use my gifts more,

618
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,120
 then I want you to also open up your hands.

619
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:58,420
 And lastly, I want to speak to those who you feel like

620
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,180
 you are right now grieving the Spirit.

621
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,920
 You are limited and you are limiting His work

622
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,600
 right now in your life because of something you have done,

623
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,640
 something that you are wrestling with.

624
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,560
 Then I want to say to you,

625
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,760
 as the Holy Spirit would say to all of us,

626
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,560
 with compassion, with gentleness,

627
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,240
 with a longing that we grow in time with Him,

628
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,840
 not a condemnation,

629
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,000
 that the Spirit would want to reveal to you

630
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,040
 what is exactly holding you back from experiencing

631
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,720
 the Holy Spirit in your personal life,

632
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,640
 but also in our gathered community times together.

633
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,160
 If that is the case,

634
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,200
 God would want us to just pray what David prayed

635
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,520
 in Psalm 139.

636
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,960
 And let's pray this together.

637
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,120
 Father, you've spoken today.

638
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,760
 So we ask you to search our hearts, O Lord.

639
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,160
 And because you know our hearts,

640
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,320
 would you try us and would you reveal our thoughts,

641
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
 the things that lurk beneath the surface,

642
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,960
 the things that we don't even understand and know.

643
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,240
 And if there is any way that limits your work

644
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,200
 in our life, Father,

645
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,240
 would you lead us away from that way of thinking?

646
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,800
 Would you lead us away from that way of life

647
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,800
 so that we may be more aware that you are working,

648
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,560
 you are speaking right now to us, living God.

649
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,080
 And so Lord, together, we, as our brothers and sisters,

650
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,080
 our response today in one voice, with one heart, Lord,

651
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,120
 we want to say, we want to be channels

652
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,000
 of your grace and your mercy.

653
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,400
 We pray that as we surrender you,

654
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,160
 your grace would continue to flow through us

655
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,800
 and you would never stop doing this in our lifetime.

656
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:49,240
 And so forgive us, help us to be more aware,

657
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,160
 help us to flee from the temptation

658
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,040
 to be depositories rather than channels.

659
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,880
 And so Holy Spirit, we give you permission now

660
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,280
 to do what you desire to do,

661
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,040
 what you've always longed to do,

662
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,960
 and we give you permission and space.

663
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,760
 And so Father, help us to live this life together.

664
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
 In your name we pray, amen.

665
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,200
 Let us worship him together.

666
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,800
 (gentle music)

667
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,400
 (gentle music)

668
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:28,400
