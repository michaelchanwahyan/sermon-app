[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   Oh man, it's so good to be here with you.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.360]   If you're new to the Vine, my name's Andrew.
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.640]   I'm one of the pastors here, and it's just great that we get to fellowship.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.240]   It's great that we get to come together in a city like we live in and worship God in
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.320]   that way and just for that resurrection power to be at work in that.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.280]   And that's my prayer for you as we open this time of just hearing from God's Word that
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.080]   you would continue to know and to understand and to feel that resurrection power in you.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.960]   A number of years ago, I was in a work meeting.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.800]   I was in a work meeting where I was feeling way out of my depth, way, way out of my comfort
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.800]   zone.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.360]   I wonder if you've ever been in a work meeting like that where you realize that you're the
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.880]   dumbest person in the room.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.520]   Anyone ever been in that moment?
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.080]   If not, you need a new job, okay?
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.960]   You need a new job.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.960]   I was in a meeting.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.520]   At the time, I was working for a US investment bank, and I was in this meeting room in our
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.680]   offices in Tokyo.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.840]   Now I wasn't actually supposed to be in this meeting, but one of my colleagues had called
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.280]   in sick that morning, and my boss had asked me to represent them in this meeting.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.200]   And the reason why I was incredibly nervous, sweaty and shaky kind of nervous, was that
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.200]   this meeting was with four of the top bankers, investment bankers in our bank in the whole
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.200]   of Asia.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.600]   These four people were well known to everybody who worked in the bank.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.160]   They were revered, and they were feared.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.040]   I realized just before the meeting, I was thinking about this.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.880]   I was thinking their combined net worth was probably higher than the GDP of some small
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.880]   Asian countries.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.000]   I mean, these were very powerful people.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.840]   I was just 24 years old at the time.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.440]   I didn't really know anything, and I was subbing in for a colleague into this meeting that
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.680]   I really had no preparation for.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.880]   I made sure that I got to that meeting super early.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.440]   That was a meeting that I was not going to be late to, right?
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.560]   So I get there super early.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.080]   I go into this room, big, huge conference room, massive conference table.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.640]   And I'm trying to go, "Okay, where do I sit on this table that would be the best for when
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.640]   these people arrive?"
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.120]   And I'm looking at the table, and I decide I'm going to sit right down in the middle
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.360]   of this long conference table.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.760]   That'll give people the chance to kind of sit around me when they come in, and we'll
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.480]   all be gathered in the center of the table.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.920]   Well about five minutes of me just sitting there, kind of sweaty and a bit shaky, these
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.320]   four men walk into the room.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.360]   They all come in together about five minutes late, and they're chatting kind of like in
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.720]   loud voices together, and that kind of confident tone that people who have incredible power
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.680]   and incredible wealth sort of hold.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.560]   And I'm sitting there thinking, "Oh my gosh, this is literally the worst day of my life."
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.640]   And as they come in, they sit on the far other end of the conference table, and they sit
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.320]   down just the four of them at the head of the table, and I could realize that they had
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.920]   no idea there was somebody else in the room.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.880]   Or if they knew it, they were just plain ignoring me.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.400]   And they keep on chatting together, and after a little while, one of them looks up, and
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.080]   he stares at me, and perhaps for the first time, they realize that there's somebody else
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.360]   in the room, and he says this.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.360]   He goes, "Who are you?"
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.360]   It's a great way to start a meeting, right?
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   "Who are you?"
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.640]   And I'm like, "I'm Andrew.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.840]   I'm Miko's replacement.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.600]   She's sick today, so I'm in this meeting with you."
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.640]   And they kind of just stared at me, all four of them.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.800]   And then they turned around and started chatting together again.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.400]   And they weren't even chatting about what we were supposed to be talking about in the
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   meeting.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.040]   They were just chatting amongst themselves.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.840]   And as I sat there, really awkward, I listened in to what they were talking about.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.320]   They were talking about the state of the world, and most specifically, actually, they were
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.640]   talking about the state of humanity, which was really quite fascinating.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.600]   These four bankers were talking about the state of humanity, and I realized after a
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.800]   little while that they were having a debate amongst themselves, and two of them were arguing
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.000]   one position, and the other two were arguing the other.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.720]   Two of them were basically saying humanity is essentially sick, that the human condition
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.840]   is essentially sick, and humanity is in need of a doctor.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.840]   And if humanity can work out what it needs to help itself, then humanity can get better,
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.600]   and perhaps in the future, it might be able to thrive.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.440]   The other two bankers were arguing the opposite.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.360]   They were saying, "No, no, humanity is not sick.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.720]   Humanity is well.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.400]   Humanity essentially is good.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   Look at our intelligence.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   Look at our wisdom.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.420]   Look at the gifts and the talents that humans have.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.160]   Look through human history and the amazing ways that humans have done things in this
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.160]   world."
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.660]   They were just saying, "Look, humanity is well.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.160]   It doesn't need a doctor.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.680]   It needs opportunity.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.880]   And the more opportunity that's created for humanity, the best, the fittest, and the best
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.680]   will emerge to the top, and they'll lead the world into a better future."
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.320]   And they were arguing back and forth.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   "Humanity is sick.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.320]   Humanity is well.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   Humanity is sick.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   Humanity is well."
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.800]   And I'm sitting there, and after a while, about five minutes of this, one of them turns
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.560]   to me and he goes, "Miko's replacement."
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   Doesn't even say Andrew, right?
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.560]   He's like, "Miko's replacement.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.360]   What do you think?
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.000]   Do you think humanity is essentially sick and in need of a doctor, or do you think humanity
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.400]   is essentially well and just needs some opportunity?"
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.920]   All four of them are staring at me to see what I say.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.480]   And this is like the worst position you can be in, right?
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.720]   Because whatever I answer, whichever side I take, I'm going to offend at least two of
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.960]   these powerful people in the room, right?
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.640]   So I'm like, "Is there a right answer here?"
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.920]   And I'm trying to desperately work out, "What's the answer that they are wanting me to say?"
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.640]   And as I'm trying to think about that, the Holy Spirit speaks to me.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.080]   And the Holy Spirit, out of nowhere, says this to me.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.000]   He says, "What would the Apostle Paul say to that question?"
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.800]   I wonder if you've ever been in a situation where you didn't want God to speak to you?
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.520]   Anyone been in that kind of, anyone been in that sort of situation where God says something
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.480]   to your spirit and you're like, "Not now, God.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.680]   I'll get back to being a Christian after this meeting, okay?
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.600]   I don't want to interact with you right now.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.280]   I'm trying to save my career with these four very powerful people."
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.760]   And God said again, "What would the Apostle Paul say to that question?"
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.360]   And I remember this real quick prayer as these guys are watching me.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.160]   I remember saying, "Lord, if I say that, they will probably fire me.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.760]   I will lose my job and my wife will leave me."
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.880]   I'm catastrophizing at this point.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.400]   And here's what the Holy Spirit said, "If you believe what the Apostle Paul taught,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.680]   then you should say it."
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:43.340]   So I look up at these four men who are staring at me, and I say, "I actually think there's
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.440]   a third option.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.680]   I actually don't think that humanity is sick and in need of a doctor.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.840]   I don't think humanity is well and in need of opportunity.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:04.800]   I think actually humanity's dead and in need of resurrection."
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.160]   They did not clap.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:18.480]   In fact, the four of them just stared at me for what felt like a really long time.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.740]   And then they started to talk together and ignored me the rest of the meeting.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.280]   They obviously thought I was some religious nut.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:35.060]   And I suddenly in that moment realized that for the first time in my life, I truly resonated
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.700]   with what Paul says.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:44.580]   I knew in that moment that my career was dead and desperately in need of resurrection.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.100]   You may understand now that I am no longer a banker.
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.020]   I'm a pastor.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.540]   That is my story.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:59.460]   It's an interesting thing, though.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.100]   This idea that humanity is spiritually dead and in need of resurrection, it's not a very
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.220]   popular one in modern cultural society.
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:13.180]   Fascinatingly, actually, it's not a very popular one even in a lot of churches.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.700]   Because it's easier to tell people that humanity's just sick, a little bit sick and in need of
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.700]   a doctor.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:24.100]   And if you get the right amount of self-help and the right amount of exercise and the right
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.380]   amount of positive thinking, if you read my latest book that I've written on leadership
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:33.100]   abilities to you, you'll be able to thrive and flourish as best as possible.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.820]   It's easier to tell people that.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.620]   It's easier, in fact, to tell them that, "No, actually, you're well.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.620]   You're fantastic.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.620]   That everything you should ever need for future prosperity is found within you.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.580]   You just need to try harder.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.100]   You just need to do this.
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.660]   You need to read this," or whatever it might be.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.100]   It's actually easy to tell people that they're essentially well and they just need better
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.100]   opportunity.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.820]   "Oh, if you had better opportunity, if you had better circumstances in life, everything
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.860]   would be fine for you."
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:07.340]   It's not easy to actually represent biblical truth, to actually represent how the scriptures
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:13.620]   speak about the human condition because it's challenging, because it puts us in a bit of
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:20.180]   an awkward space and it asks some really big questions about us.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:25.380]   And when the Apostle Paul is writing to his church in Ephesus and he's trying to communicate
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.820]   to them the heart of the Father, he's trying to communicate what God's will is in the world,
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:36.620]   he's trying to pray for them and show them the power that is put aside for them in a
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.300]   God who has been raised from death to life and now is the name that is above every name
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.620]   and that every knee is going to bow under that as he's talking about all these incredible
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.620]   things.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.900]   He comes to the second chapter and he says, "Now I want to talk about you.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.940]   I want you to understand who you are and what your condition is."
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:02.260]   Because if you can understand the human condition, then you can actually understand in a new
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:09.420]   way the profundity and the power and the wonder and the majesty of the gospel.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.380]   Because when we understand who we are, we begin to get a different revelation of the
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:21.700]   work that Christ has done for us and we cannot step back and say, "Hallelujah!"
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:29.260]   Because we realize that it's not about us trying to fix ourselves, but we are literally
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.820]   dead and in need of resurrection.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:41.780]   And when the one who comes to bring resurrection comes, we find ourselves in a posture of humble
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:49.260]   gratitude and thankfulness and an infused life so that we can actually begin to live
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.680]   in the way that we were truly created to be.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.900]   We have to journey through death to receive life.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.380]   And Paul writes to the church about this.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.900]   These are some of the most famous words that Paul writes in any of his letters in the New
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.900]   Testament.
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.620]   I'm going to read this to you in a minute and you're going to recognize a bunch of these
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:13.360]   things, themes and ideas and a theology that is very familiar to us if you've been coming
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   to church for a while.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.580]   It's so familiar to you.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.500]   But I pray that as we unpack this a little bit together as a community today, you'll
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.740]   come to a deeper understanding about the reality of what it is that Christ has done for you
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.340]   and that those dead things that we've been talking about so far on the surface, that
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:35.060]   in those dead areas you might believe again that they could come to resurrected life.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:40.140]   Let me read this to you from Ephesians chapter 2, verse 1.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:48.940]   As for you, notice this, you were dead, not sick, not well, you were dead in your transgressions
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.220]   and sins in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:58.660]   ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.860]   All of us lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.460]   its desires and thoughts.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:11.760]   Like the rest, we were by nature, notice that, by nature objects of wrath.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.020]   But because of his great love for us, God who is rich in mercy made us now alive with
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:23.340]   Christ even when we were dead in our transgressions, for it is by grace that you have been saved.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:28.260]   And God has raised us up with Christ and now has seated us in the heavenly realms in Christ
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.100]   Jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.980]   grace expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:44.100]   For it is by grace that you have been saved, through faith.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.820]   And this not for a work in yourself, for it is the gift of God, not by works so that you
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.660]   cannot boast.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:56.700]   For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.740]   in advance for us to do.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.740]   Father, I just pray that as we open your word here, you would move by your spirit, that
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:08.420]   there would be a demonstration of your spirit's power and that for some people in this room
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:13.020]   who right now feel they are dead, that they would be brought to life, Lord.
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:17.580]   And I pray for areas in our lives where we're looking for you to move, you would, through
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.580]   your word.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.380]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.140]   Everyone says, "Paul doesn't mince his words.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.900]   He speaks direct to his church because he wants them to understand who they were before
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.100]   they met Christ and now what Christ has done in and through them."
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.820]   And what I want to do with us just over the next number of minutes here is I want to actually
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.020]   map out for you how Paul presents this.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.900]   Because the gospel presented in this way is such a profound realization for his people
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:51.020]   and he wants them to journey through these 10 verses from a place of death to resurrection.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.140]   So the first three verses, he starts with this profound thing.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.780]   He says, "We have to understand that we were dead."
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.260]   Again, not sick, in a need of a doctor, not well, in a need of some opportunity.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:09.780]   Literally when it came to the spirit, when it comes to our soul, humanity is dead.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.660]   The word that he uses in the Greek here in these three verses, the way that it's phrased,
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.020]   he's talking about absolute and universal.
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.060]   He's not just saying, "Hey, some people are dead."
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.020]   He's not just saying the really bad people, the really evil people, the people like Hitler,
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.780]   they're the dead ones.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.540]   He's saying all of us.
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.780]   No one escapes the reality that because of what happened in the garden, because although
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:36.100]   Christ created humanity well and good in Genesis 1 and 2 and blessed them, in Genesis 3 they
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.860]   chose to take of that fruit that they were told not to.
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.340]   In that, the disobedience of sin and rebellion came into the human spirit.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:48.740]   And basically from that point onwards, humanity has been dead in its soul.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.140]   And it's dead and crying out for new life.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.060]   And so Paul's starting point for his church is to understand that there was a time where
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.180]   in the transgressions and their sin, they found themselves dead.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:06.340]   In fact, in unpacking this idea of death, he says there are three things in these three
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.940]   verses, three things that have been at work to cause us to die.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:19.580]   He says it's the world, he said it's the devil, and he said it's flesh.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.020]   He says we are in the world and the ways of the world have been acting upon us.
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:29.740]   For Paul, this is the area of something that is outside of us, something that is without
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.740]   us, outside of us, acting upon us.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:39.140]   And he's basically saying that the world and its cultures and its brokenness and this depravity
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.340]   of sin that's working through the world's cultures and the world's systems is keeping
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.340]   you dead.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.300]   It's wanting you to follow its way of thinking, but that is not the right way of thinking.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.780]   There is a third way.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.420]   And he's saying that there is this death that is there.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.380]   He then speaks about the devil.
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.820]   He says the ruler of the kingdom of air.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.260]   It's a beautiful phrase from him, a ruler of the kingdom of the air.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.180]   This is the reality of evil.
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:08.260]   He says evil is present in this world and we can't shy away from the fact that there
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:13.460]   is good, yes, but there is also evil and this evil is beyond us.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.900]   It's beyond anything that we could ever think or imagine.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.700]   It's out there in the world and there is a ruler of the kingdom of the air and that is
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.700]   at work.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:26.100]   And his spirit is also causing us to become disobedient, he teaches.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.740]   He then says that all of us at some point, we have had these cravings inside of us to
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.140]   satisfy, to gratify our sinful nature.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.700]   In other places he uses this word flesh.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:42.820]   It's just the idea of our sinful brokenness and this is within us.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.620]   So he's saying without us, in other words, what is around, he's saying beyond us is evil
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.140]   that is there in the world.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:54.780]   He's saying within us are brokenness and our sin and transgressions that are within us.
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:02.260]   These three things mean that we in our soul, the thing that is eternal in our spirit, we're
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.620]   dead.
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.260]   He's not saying, "Hey, humans can't do anything good."
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.260]   He's not saying that humans don't have the ability to be kind or to be loving or to be
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.480]   selfless or to be generous.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.900]   He's not speaking about just the behavioral stuff we do.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.620]   He's talking about the soul.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:25.380]   He's talking about our spiritual soul and he's saying that is dead.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.020]   Before you met Christ, that's the only way to think about it.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.700]   Are you following this?
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.700]   That's the first three verses.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.220]   He's like, "You've got to make sure you're starting in the right place."
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:41.260]   But then he actually goes and says in verses four to seven, but he says, "You, we are now
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.700]   alive.
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.420]   We've been made alive in Christ."
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.420]   The beautiful phrase.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.340]   He's like, "Even when we were dead."
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.340]   Notice this.
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:57.780]   "Even when we were dead in our transgressions, Christ came and paid the price, life, death,
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:04.020]   and resurrection, so that we now are made alive," is the phrase he uses, "made alive
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.020]   in Christ."
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.780]   That's the same phrase he uses in other places.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:12.140]   Sometimes it's translated, "Resurrected in Christ."
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.340]   It's profound what Paul's doing here because he's just spent a bunch of verses in chapter
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.700]   one, unpacking the idea of what God did in Christ.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.860]   That Christ, in submitting himself to the will of his Father, went to the cross, paid
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:32.020]   the price for sin, went into death, but was raised from death to life, then became the
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:37.460]   name that is above every name that every ruler and power and authority needs to submit now
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.420]   under the authority of Christ.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.620]   Christ is now in this place.
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.260]   And actually, Paul has just written in chapter one that Christ now sits at the right hand
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:50.820]   of the Father in the heavenly realms, and that at the name of Jesus, every knee will
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.420]   bow on heaven and earth.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.820]   And all of this is happening for the glory of the church.
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.940]   So he's just unpacked this beautiful picture of Jesus' journey from death to resurrection.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.340]   Now at the beginning of chapter two, he flips it onto us.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.100]   He says, "You need to understand the journey you've been in, because you were once dead,
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.820]   just like Christ.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.580]   But you have, through his Spirit, been raised from death to life."
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.860]   And then he takes it a step further.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.100]   This blows my mind.
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:23.020]   He says, "And not only that, not only has he raised you, but you are now seated," he
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:28.340]   says, "in this area that he calls the heavenly realms."
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.620]   I want you to just get your head around this for a moment.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:36.540]   We're not just resurrected in Christ, but we are now raised up to the heavenly realms,
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.140]   and we sit with Christ in the heavenly realms.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:46.460]   The picture is one of relationship, one of friendship, one of camaraderie, sitting together.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.540]   It's a picture of relaxation and not stress.
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.300]   When you're sitting with the one who has all authority over everything in the world, we
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.620]   find ourselves in shalom, peace.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:02.740]   And Paul's saying, "This is what those who are in Christ Jesus, you are spiritually sitting
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.420]   with Christ in the heavenly realms, at the right hand of the Father with Christ."
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:12.380]   In other words, all of the power that he had spoken about in the prayer that we looked
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.820]   at last week and that I was preaching about last week, all of that power is now found
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:22.600]   in us spiritually because we are at the right hand of the Father as well, seated with Christ.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.700]   It blows our minds.
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.500]   Now I want you to see what Paul's doing here in saying this.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:34.580]   He wants to draw this contrast between the lowest possible thing, you are literally dead,
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:39.460]   to the highest possible thing, you are now seated in Christ Jesus on the right hand of
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.140]   the Father in the Spirit.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.020]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.780]   And for Paul, the reason why he's saying this, because he wants us to understand that there
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:54.900]   are only two types of human beings, those who are dead and those who are seated with
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.540]   Christ in the heavenly realms, just two.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:03.700]   Those who are spiritually dead and those who are alive and been made alive in Christ and
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.940]   are seated at the right hand of the Father.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.780]   This is hope.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:17.700]   But in this, Paul is saying, "Do you want to know how this happens?
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.700]   Do you want to know?"
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.700]   Because guess what?
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.780]   Like Ezekiel, when God says to him, "Can these bones live?"
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:30.140]   Ezekiel's response is, "Sovereign Lord, only you know."
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.580]   And it's the same in humanity.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:40.620]   Can we live when we've been soaked in the travesty of our transgressions and sins?
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.780]   Only you, Lord, know.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.940]   Only you can bring this dead thing to life.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:53.380]   This is why in verses 8 and 9, Paul explains how that process takes place, how new life
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.380]   comes.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:22:02.220]   And he says, "This is why you've been saved by grace through faith, not by your own works,
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.860]   so that no one can boast."
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:09.740]   He talks about a negative and a positive as he's trying to speak about this beauty of
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:10.740]   the gospel.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.380]   First of all, he starts with the negative.
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:18.100]   He says there's this thing called works, our human works, the things that we are trying
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.260]   to do to maybe try to be better people.
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.900]   He's saying, "You've got to understand that this cannot ever save you, that salvation
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.940]   is not about what we can do.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.260]   And this is countercultural to what we see in society."
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.100]   I want to challenge us that it's countercultural to what we see in Hong Kong, because Hong
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:41.980]   Kong is literally built on a culture of meritocracy, on a culture of if you try really hard, if
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.020]   you work really hard, if you become the best student in your class, you can get certain
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.860]   things, if you go to the right kind of universities, you can get the right kind of jobs.
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:55.780]   And our thinking always in the world around us is, "If I do more, I will get more."
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.340]   Are you with me?
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:01.300]   And Paul doesn't want his church in Ephesus to bring that into their thinking about their
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.820]   spirit or into their thinking about their relationship with God.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.500]   If I do more, I'm going to get more.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.420]   And he cuts it out right at the start.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.580]   And he says, "You're not saved by anything you do.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:17.500]   You cannot ever do enough to earn your salvation," he's saying.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.680]   And this is important because he's basically said to us, "You're dead.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.620]   Dead things don't do anything, by the way."
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.220]   You want to know why works doesn't save you?
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.900]   It's because you're dead.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.500]   And if you're dead, you can't do anything.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.840]   That's number one.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:40.460]   Number two is this, even if you could do something, your greatest moral acts will always pale
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.160]   into insignificance to the righteousness of Christ.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.820]   No matter how great we could be, no matter how much we could do, no matter how much we
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.980]   could do for charity, how nice of a person we could be, how much love we could give,
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.660]   it would always pale in significance to the righteousness that is found in Christ.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:03.100]   When we try to compare our righteousness with the righteousness of Christ, pride fills us
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.740]   and we're heading towards more and more sin.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.140]   And Paul's saying, "Your works, both because you're dead, you can't do in any way, but
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:14.300]   even if you could do them, they wouldn't even compare to the righteousness found in Christ.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:21.420]   None of that is going to get you anywhere, so no one can boast."
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.700]   This is really important.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.820]   In the Greek and Roman culture, boasting was a huge thing.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.740]   We'll talk more about that in another week, but even here in Hong Kong, boasting is a
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:30.740]   big thing still, isn't it?
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.740]   Oh, no, it's not.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.740]   Okay.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:37.980]   It's not about the car I drive, the watch I wear, the clothes I have, the university
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.020]   that my kids have gone to.
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.780]   We love to boast, I think, all the time.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:47.300]   Could you imagine what church would be like if we actually earned our salvation?
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.860]   Have you ever stopped and thought about that for a moment?
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.380]   Can you imagine what church would be like if all of us earned our way into heaven?
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.860]   Number one, most of us would not be in this room, myself included.
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:03.300]   Number two, those of us that did get in, we'd be like, "Whoa, we got in."
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.300]   And no one else did.
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.300]   We're the cool ones.
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.300]   We're the lucky ones.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.300]   We're the great ones.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.300]   We're the awesome ones.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.860]   Paul's like, "There is no room for that kind of mental thinking or that attitude within
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.860]   the church.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.540]   No, you are all dead, even in your transgressions and sin.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:23.900]   But when you were dead, Christ raised you from death to life, not because you did anything
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:29.300]   so that no one could boast, so that no other name other than the name of Jesus would be
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.540]   heard in the world.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.940]   Not a name of a church, a name of a preacher, a name of a worship leader, a name of a song,
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.980]   not anything like that.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.140]   The only thing that gets to be projected in this world is Christ.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.620]   That's why our works don't save us," Paul's saying.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.460]   So you're not saved by works.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:52.260]   He says this, "You're saved simply by this incredible idea of grace."
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:59.100]   Grace, this Greek word means unmerited favor, this idea of a gift.
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.180]   This idea of a gift that we have, and we talked about this quite a lot at the Vine, we have
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:09.620]   not earned and we have not deserved.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.560]   We actually sing about that quite a bit as well.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   We have not earned it.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.700]   We have not deserved it.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.780]   But we have this incredible grace from God.
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.180]   And here's the reason Paul is saying that it is not deserved or earned.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.500]   It is not deserved because you're dead.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.660]   It is not earned because none of your works could ever get you there.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.660]   That's grace.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.100]   And he's saying that this grace is at work in this world.
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:37.820]   And that you, because you have experienced that grace in you, you are now living examples
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.140]   of that grace.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.180]   And Paul is mapping out this beautiful picture because he wants his church to understand
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:50.180]   the journey that they've been on, but also the journey that others could go on as well.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:54.540]   Because Christ has gone to the cross, Paul is saying, and he's paid the price for sin,
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.460]   and he's been raised from death to life, and he now sits at the right hand of the Father.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:05.060]   And anyone who comes to believe in him, anyone who asks for the forgiveness of sins, who
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:09.940]   confesses the name of Jesus, they also can be saved.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.220]   Anyone.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.940]   Now this is not universalism.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.620]   Christ has done it on the cross, therefore everybody's saved, and it doesn't matter what
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.620]   you do in life.
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:22.220]   No, Paul breaks the idea of universalism with one simple phrase in the passage here in verse
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.220]   8 and 9.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.220]   He says, "Through faith."
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.020]   It's a really important little phrase he says.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:34.100]   We are saved by grace, not by our works, through faith.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:41.660]   In other words, there is something we as humanity do to align ourselves to the work of the cross.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.940]   It's not some universalism where Christ has died for all, and it doesn't matter what you
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.940]   do.
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.140]   No, we align ourselves.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.180]   We receive the power of the work of the cross.
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:56.300]   We receive the power of resurrection life through faith.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.060]   Through recognizing that Christ has done this, and moving in that.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.800]   For Paul, the definition of faith is two things.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.900]   It is both belief and trust.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.820]   Is this helping anyone so far?
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.980]   Both belief and trust.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.060]   And both of those things are important.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.420]   Sometimes we think faith is just about belief.
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.860]   As long as I can believe the right things, then everything's going to be okay.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.940]   For Paul, if you look throughout his letters, it's belief and trust.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.300]   Those two things work hand in hand.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.300]   Give you an example of this.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:31.340]   A number of years ago, I was at university in a place called Durham in the northeast
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.500]   of England.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.300]   Durham has this beautiful river that runs through the center of the town, and there
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:41.620]   are some high, maybe 40 feet or so cliffs that are around it, and then the river weaves
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.420]   through the town.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.300]   At university, there's this thing called Freshers' Week.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.340]   It probably happened at your university too, where all the new people come to the university,
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.460]   and parties are held, and bands play.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.820]   In my time, weird as it sounds, there was a circus.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:00.460]   They had a circus at the university to welcome in all the new people.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.580]   One of the circus acts was the tightrope walking thing.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:11.580]   On one day, this guy strung a metal wire across the two sides of the cliff face over the river,
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.460]   and he walked from one side to the other on this small little tightrope.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.460]   It was amazing.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.540]   There were many of us in the crowd that day watching this guy walk from one side to the
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.540]   other.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.820]   We thought halfway across he was going to fall.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.180]   He would shake, but no.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.980]   He got from one side to the other.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.580]   We were cheering him when he got to the other side.
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.900]   When he got to the other side, he did this crazy thing.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.620]   He took a colleague from the circus, a light person.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.620]   They weren't that heavy.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:43.860]   He put him up on his shoulders, and then he walked back the other way with this guy on
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.860]   his shoulders.
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.100]   It was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.340]   I can't believe that he's doing this with a guy on his shoulders.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.340]   We surely thought he was going to die every step of the way, but he got there to the other
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.340]   side.
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.020]   When he got to the other side, we were cheering.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.020]   We were screaming.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.240]   This was the coolest thing we'd ever seen.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.300]   As the guy gets off his shoulders, the guy who just walked across, he points to somebody
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.300]   in the crowd.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.340]   He goes, "Do you believe that I could do this with you?"
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.420]   The guy in the crowd was trying to shrink away.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.900]   He said what I think all of us were feeling in that moment.
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.100]   He was like, "Well, I believe you can do it because I've just seen you do it, but I don't
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:22.180]   know if I would trust you to do it."
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.180]   This is faith.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.580]   It's more than just the belief that Jesus died and rose again.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:35.980]   It's trusting your life to him and entrusting, trusting that he will carry you from here
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.980]   to here.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:42.100]   So, Paul, what he's trying to do is help everybody to go, "Okay, this is the journey.
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.740]   You are dead in your sin-induced transgressions because of the world, because of the devil,
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:51.900]   because of the flesh, but you have been raised to new life in Christ through faith.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.020]   That new life leads you into the heavenly realms where you're now seated at the right
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.180]   hand of the Father.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.940]   This is not done for you by works.
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:03.860]   No, it's done for you only by grace that is found in Christ Jesus.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:09.460]   And in that grace, undeserved, unmerited by you, through faith, your belief and trust
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:15.020]   that Jesus indeed died for your sins and rose again, you are able to also now no longer
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:21.060]   be stuck in the death of your soul, but you can find new life through Christ Jesus.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:25.260]   For it is by grace that you have been saved in faith."
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.860]   And this, not something that you have accomplished.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.260]   "For if it was by your works, you would boast.
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:35.860]   This is a work of the Spirit," Paul says.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.860]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.140]   Nobody thinks that that's amazing.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.140]   Is that amazing?
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.180]   That's the gospel.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.100]   Now, here's the crazy thing.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.100]   Paul doesn't stop there.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.100]   He has one more verse.
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.060]   I want you to read this because this is one of the most famous verses that we have in
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.060]   Ephesians.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:58.500]   "For we are God's workmanship," Paul says, "created in Christ Jesus to do good works,
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.180]   which God prepared in advance for us to do."
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.620]   This is how he wraps it all up.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:08.060]   He says, "Now that you understand the journey that there is in going from death to the fullness
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:13.140]   of life through Christ by His grace, you have to realize now that you, therefore, are God's
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.260]   workmanship," is the phrase he uses.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.620]   The Greek word is the word poiema.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:23.460]   It actually is the word that we translate into the English word poem.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:28.620]   Paul's like, "You are God's poem," that He's written something for the world to see in
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.300]   and through you.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.100]   When he says, "You are God's workmanship," he's not talking about that first moment of
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.100]   your creation.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.860]   Elsewhere in the Bible, it says that you were knitted and made in your mother's womb, and
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.740]   that's an amazing thing, but that's not what Paul's speaking about here.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:46.660]   When he says that you are a workmanship of God, what he's speaking about is everything
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.460]   that he's just said in the passage.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.580]   He's talking about the fact that you have been transformed and renewed.
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.940]   Elsewhere, he says that when you're in Christ Jesus, you're a new creation.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.560]   The old is gone, the new has come.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.080]   This is his phrase for it here in Ephesians.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.660]   You are God's workmanship.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:07.540]   Another way of saying it, you are a masterpiece of art, that Christ has changed your life,
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.100]   literally taken you from death to life, and He has done that for you by His grace, and
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.380]   you now are a living embodiment of the grace of Christ in your life.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.180]   That's awesome, he's saying.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:23.380]   You're a masterpiece, a masterpiece of the grace of God, and because you're a masterpiece,
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.240]   you shouldn't shy yourself away.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.460]   You should hang yourselves in the galleries of this world.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.980]   You should be in the marketplace.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.300]   You should be in society.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.300]   You should be in your families.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.860]   You should be in your workplaces.
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:39.180]   You should be influencing everything out there because you are a work of art.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:46.020]   You're a masterpiece on display for all the world to see, he's saying.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:50.620]   Michelangelo, one of the great sculptors, once was chipping away at a shapeless rock,
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:55.100]   and somebody asked him what he was doing, and his reply was this, "I am liberating an
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.420]   angel from this stone."
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:03.020]   And I think if you were to say to Paul, "How would you help people to understand what Christ
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.320]   has done in them?"
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:11.960]   He would say, "He has liberated you from the stone of death, and He has shaped and formed
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:19.020]   you into someone who can now live, and live in a way that would show the world the glory
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.020]   of Christ."
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:25.780]   So he says, "There is a work that Christ has done in you so that you can now be a work
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.780]   in the world."
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.380]   It's not the works of salvation that we've just talked about, because we know that those
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.060]   works are not what it's about.
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:36.380]   This is a new work that we can now do, not one that earns us salvation, but one that
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:40.540]   shows the world the grace of salvation.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.780]   So he says, "You go now and do that.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:49.920]   You go be Christ in the world, His hands and His feet and His grace, living as this embodiment
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.880]   of a different narrative.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:35:01.440]   You are Miko's replacement, sat in a room, and when the narratives of the world are presented,
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:08.760]   you have the courage to say that there's a third way, that you have a testimony in your
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.880]   life of a life that has been changed by the grace of Christ."
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:19.680]   If we were to summarize Paul, we'd say it this way, "What you are is a gift of God.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.680]   What you now do is your gift to Him.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:30.840]   You're a gift by grace, because He loves you, and out of love and mercy, He has changed
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.080]   and transformed you.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.640]   Now how you live matters."
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.960]   Just a little bit further on, we'll see this in a few weeks' time, Paul will say, "Live
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.680]   a life worthy of that calling."
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.160]   He challenges his church.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   Live a life worthy.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.680]   That's what he's saying here too.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:48.080]   You're God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.320]   I love the way that Erwin McManus puts it.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:57.880]   He says, "You're not just a work of art, but you are also artist at work."
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.920]   So if you're a painter, paint.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.440]   If you're a writer, write.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.800]   If you're a teacher, educate and teach.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.160]   If you're a banker, bank.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:20.760]   If you're a lawyer, if you're a lawyer, I pray for you, if you're a lawyer, judge fairly.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:25.440]   If you work for the government, lead humbly and diligently.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.320]   Whatever it is that is before you, do it in a way that honors and glorifies Christ, because
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.160]   you are no longer dead.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.040]   He can bring the dead things and bring them to life.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:42.960]   My prayer for you is that you would go from here today filled with this joy in your heart,
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.600]   that you have been one who has been chosen by Him in grace.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.040]   And in your faith and trust and belief in Him, you have aligned yourselves to the forgiveness
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:58.480]   that was there on the cross, a forgiveness that sets your soul free, so you can now live
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.360]   as you were truly created to be.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:09.000]   May you feel the wind in the Spirit upon you, as you be who you have been created to be,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.400]   in the spirit of influence He has placed you in.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:18.640]   For you have been saved by grace, not by works, so that you cannot boast, but through faith,
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:25.080]   so that you as God's workmanship may be released to good works.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   Can I pray for you?
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.920]   Let's pray.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.480]   Father, we're so grateful for the people in this room, people that you love deeply and
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:40.600]   dearly, people that you have saved by a gracious act.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:48.200]   Father, I pray for anyone in this room who perhaps is just exploring faith in this time.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.680]   Maybe spirituality is a new thing for them.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:57.880]   And Lord, maybe they're exploring what it is to explore the truths and the beliefs of
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.880]   Scripture.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:04.520]   Father, I pray for anyone here that is in that camp, I just pray, Lord, that today they
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:09.840]   would feel the encouragement and the challenge of your Word.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.000]   You love them so much.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.400]   It is out of your love and your mercy, as Paul writes in this passage, that you can
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.560]   take them from death to life, and the kind of life that they have never felt or never
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.560]   lived before.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:29.520]   Lord, I pray for anyone in this room where that's resonating with them now, for the first
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.200]   time, I pray, Lord, that they would reach out to you today.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.340]   Maybe they would talk with the person that they've come from, or maybe they would come
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.960]   up and chat with us as a team after the service, and we can help you.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.440]   But if you want to give your life to Jesus, it's really a simple thing.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:50.740]   You just, in a simple prayer, just come before Him and ask Him to be your Lord and Savior.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:56.160]   You confess those sins in you that have kept you dead spiritually, as we've been talking
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:03.840]   about today, and you, through belief and trust in Him, thank Him for forgiving your sin and
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.160]   giving you new life.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.600]   And then you can just simply pray and ask for His Spirit to help you, to walk with you
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   and strengthen you.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.320]   I want to encourage you to do that.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.120]   Do that with the person you came with.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   Come up to us afterwards.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.380]   We'll do that with you personally.
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:24.080]   But I guess that there are many of us in this room where we are already Christian.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.880]   I pray that today would be an important reminder for you of the grace that has been in your
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   story.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:35.520]   And I pray out of that grace, you would leave here today with a bounce in your step, wanting
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:44.340]   to live that grace life publicly before a broken and tired and needy world.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.960]   That you would realize again that you are God's workmanship.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.080]   You've been created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:55.400]   My prayer for you is that you would walk out those works in whatever spirit of influence,
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:01.080]   whatever gifts and talents that He has placed upon you, would come to the fore in your life
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:07.440]   so that Jesus' grace would win many others from death to life.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.620]   Lord, we thank you for this.
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.940]   In Jesus' name, everyone says.
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:16.360]   Would you stand with me and we're just going to respond together in a time of worship as
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.040]   we just let the Holy Spirit continue to just minister with us.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.620]   (gentle music)
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:32.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
