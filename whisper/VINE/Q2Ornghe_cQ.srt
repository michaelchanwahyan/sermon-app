1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Well, in 2022 on Vision Sunday, Pastor Ivan and I,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,300
 together with Pastor Andrew,

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,440
 we announced that we are planting a church

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,880
 with an English and a Cantonese service.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,240
 Now, we did that during a time

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,760
 when there was still COVID restrictions.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,480
 So we had to do it on a live stream,

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,320
 so we did it on camera.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,560
 And it was actually a funny story,

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,520
 because Pastor Ivan,

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,360
 we were experimenting with,

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,760
 what do you call that thing?

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,080
 The teleprompter.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,180
 But then right when he was gonna use it, it failed.

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,400
 But he was prepared anyhow, so it was no problem.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,960
 So there's a lot of behind the scenes

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,120
 sort of stuff that happened.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,120
 But besides that, we also mentioned on that Sunday

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,480
 that we did not know where we were gonna plant the church.

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,720
 So we said we had six criteria that we're looking for,

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,360
 and with which we're gonna search.

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,040
 And hopefully, that year we had Vision Sunday

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,480
 part one and part two.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,400
 Hopefully, at Vision Sunday part two,

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,880
 we will be able to tell the church

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,000
 where we're actually planting the church.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,140
 Now, I just want you to sit in that a little bit,

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,960
 that you're going in front of a group of people,

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,920
 and you're saying you're gonna do something,

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,960
 but you don't know where you're gonna do it.

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
 And then also, you're doing it on camera,

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,560
 so at that point in time,

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,560
 you can't even physically gather with each other.

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,560
 So there was a statement of an act of faith

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,760
 and of courage that we did that.

36
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,320
 And there was another part of it.

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,400
 It was part of our vision,

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,000
 'cause we had what's called a river model vision,

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,440
 where there's this image of a river

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,480
 flowing all over across Hong Kong

41
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,840
 with all the secondary rivers and little creeks,

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,400
 and that God wants us,

43
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,940
 instead of focusing on building one big church,

44
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,840
 he wants the river to flow throughout Hong Kong,

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,560
 watering thirsty land.

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,400
 And he wants to form new and different types of communities,

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,680
 fresh expressions throughout the land

48
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,680
 to love, to serve, to share the gospel for his kingdom.

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,800
 And we also said this is greater than the wine church.

50
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,480
 This is not just wine church.

51
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,760
 We're not trying to build empire.

52
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,160
 We really just wanna be obedient to God

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,380
 and share the gospel and do his work.

54
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,480
 Now, all of this, during this time,

55
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,080
 there was also a sense that we had as a leadership

56
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,320
 that this was a prophetic act,

57
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,840
 that while other companies were pulling out of Hong Kong,

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,160
 their investments,

59
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,760
 they were shifting to regional headquarters like Singapore

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,640
 and other Asian hub cities,

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,400
 you know, we felt that God was asking us

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,800
 to double down on investing in Hong Kong.

63
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,360
 There was the sense that God was saying to us,

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,540
 I'm not finished with Hong Kong.

65
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,080
 But the reality was at the time,

66
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,440
 there was quite a few people, not everyone,

67
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,560
 but it was quite a few people

68
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,400
 who at that time felt that way.

69
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,240
 It was just a very difficult season.

70
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,560
 And so this was an act of faith and of stepping out

71
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,280
 and then doing what God asked us to do.

72
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,480
 Now, we did not do this on our own.

73
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,560
 You can't plant a church on your own.

74
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,840
 Otherwise it'd just be Ivan and I hanging out,

75
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,220
 having a beer probably or actually wine.

76
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,640
 Truth be told, it'd be wine, it wouldn't be beer.

77
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,000
 But there was others involved in that.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,160
 And so I actually want to ask those of you

79
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,940
 who were part of the launch team

80
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,140
 that met and went shy to stand up.

81
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,180
 So you see there's a few people here

82
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,440
 that were part of that.

83
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,280
 You can sit down.

84
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,280
 Thank you so much for doing that, for humoring me.

85
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,440
 (audience applauding)

86
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,520
 So this was a group of brave people

87
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,380
 who responded not to Ivan and I really,

88
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,360
 but to what God was saying to them

89
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,680
 and how God was moving and stirring in their hearts.

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,440
 And they said, yes, I want to be part of that.

91
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,840
 I can see what God wants to do.

92
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
 And so I'm gonna step out in faith.

93
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,000
 I'm gonna take this risk,

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,340
 'cause it's risky to go out, to leave your comfort.

95
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,920
 Man, the Vine Church in Wanchai is home.

96
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,000
 You know, it's been a place of healing for many of us

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,580
 and a place of friendship and a place,

98
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,880
 I know for my wife, it's the only place besides here now

99
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,800
 that she's ever been part of a church.

100
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,920
 And so this was leaving home,

101
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,280
 but everyone stepped out because they were moved

102
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,120
 and touched by the Holy Spirit to do so.

103
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,840
 And I do wanna acknowledge that subsequently,

104
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,800
 there's been people stepping out in faith

105
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,340
 and joining us in what we're doing.

106
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,560
 There's a lot of faith in going back to church

107
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,520
 if you haven't been in church in a while.

108
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,080
 There's a lot of faith in making your gifts

109
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,500
 and talents available as you join us

110
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,460
 in helping us carry out this mission

111
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,640
 and this work that God has given us.

112
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,080
 But what I wanted us to see is,

113
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,420
 it's amazing when we're willing

114
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,420
 to get out of our comfort zone what God can do.

115
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,700
 When we make ourselves available to him,

116
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,620
 and Margaret Mead, she was an American cultural anthropologist

117
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,220
 and a speaker and author, also an Anglican Christian,

118
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,700
 she said this, "Never doubt a small group

119
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,460
 "of committed people can change the world.

120
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,080
 "Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."

121
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,040
 So it always takes people to step out

122
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,700
 and take that first step into this new thing

123
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,020
 that God is doing.

124
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,020
 And so it's amazing what God has done,

125
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,300
 and I hope you've been amazed.

126
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,240
 I know Ivan and I are, and we're just blown away

127
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,180
 by the work of God, the work of the Spirit

128
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,460
 here in this community.

129
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,460
 And it's this, what we are sensing

130
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,500
 and are being called to this year again.

131
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,900
 God is calling us out of our comfort zone

132
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,700
 into uncharted waters because of the kingdom impact

133
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,660
 it will have on Hong Kong,

134
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,300
 and because of discipleship impact it will have on us.

135
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,620
 Now along with this word of uncharted waters

136
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,860
 that God has given us, there was also a prophetic image

137
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,420
 that was shared.

138
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,280
 This is Pastor Andrew shared this

139
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,340
 with the church leadership.

140
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,600
 The church leadership discerned and approved

141
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,600
 that yes, this is a word not just for Wan Chai,

142
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,400
 but it's also a word for Wan Chai,

143
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,580
 but also a word for Yuen Long as well.

144
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,780
 And after all, we are one church in two locations, right?

145
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,920
 And so this image is of a boat,

146
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,960
 of kind of during like earlier days

147
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,820
 when there was uncharted waters,

148
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,760
 when you didn't know what lies in that direction

149
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,320
 if you just sail out straight.

150
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,220
 And so there's this image of a boat heading out,

151
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,100
 and there's an excitement among the crew

152
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,800
 that is heading out on this boat.

153
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,420
 There's an anticipation and an expectation

154
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,260
 of what's to come.

155
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,000
 There's the captain standing at the bow

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,240
 and peering at the horizon,

157
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,440
 to wondering what were we gonna discover?

158
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,000
 What are we gonna find?

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,520
 And the crew is using their gifts and talents

160
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,160
 working together to,

161
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,200
 'cause that's the only way it works on these adventures.

162
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,040
 Excuse me.

163
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,200
 (microphone feedback)

164
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:32,100
 My apologies.

165
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,400
 And so the image,

166
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,480
 but there's also, so besides a sense of excitement,

167
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,800
 there's also some fear and some anxiety

168
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,760
 because going in the uncharted waters,

169
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,480
 you know, it's uncomfortable,

170
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,120
 and we don't know what's gonna happen.

171
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,600
 And there's a sense of that resilience and courage,

172
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,340
 you know, we'll be needed flexibility

173
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,820
 to make adjustments as we go.

174
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,640
 And so this was this image that God gave us for this year.

175
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,400
 Now this is not a new vision

176
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,160
 in terms of what we're doing as a church.

177
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
 We still have our river model vision

178
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,960
 and a growing big people vision

179
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,680
 that we are pursuing together.

180
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,800
 But now,

181
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,000
 but this is what we sense God inviting us

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,320
 into is stepping in these uncharted waters

183
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,760
 and this uncharted territory.

184
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,320
 Now, I know that many of you feel like,

185
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,440
 "Man, Tim, we just got settled here.

186
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,280
 "We just, we already did the uncharted thing.

187
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,120
 "We already went out.

188
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,160
 "Come on, what are you talking about?"

189
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,240
 You know, and we understand that.

190
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,120
 And it's been amazing, you know,

191
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,840
 that we made ourselves available.

192
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,500
 We went and we've experienced what God has done.

193
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,680
 But we sense that last year was a bit of a time

194
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,960
 of also resting, you know, of that intimacy.

195
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,720
 We also talked about, there was a lot of healing.

196
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,520
 You know, we had the sermons, he's longing for healing.

197
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,560
 We felt that God was doing healing work.

198
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,080
 And so, but now he's inviting us to set out again

199
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,600
 as a boat together.

200
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,800
 And we didn't plant this church to stay in the harbor.

201
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,360
 You know, we plant this church to set out

202
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,360
 into the community, into the businesses,

203
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,120
 into your families, into your neighborhoods.

204
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,360
 And then as we're sailing out,

205
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,720
 we believe that there will be discoveries

206
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,280
 of the work of God is doing,

207
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,760
 that he wants us to say yes to,

208
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,640
 and to give ourselves to, you know,

209
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,560
 to these things that God is doing,

210
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,340
 where the spirit of God is moving.

211
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,460
 And then when we, when you see God work,

212
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,560
 when he invites you to something,

213
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,760
 it does take that decisive response.

214
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,600
 You know, you cannot say, "Oh yeah, okay, maybe later."

215
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,600
 No, if God is moving here, this is like a Kairos moment.

216
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,120
 Like it's an opportune time, we need to respond now.

217
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,320
 We need to give ourselves to it now.

218
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,960
 And there's things we're just not gonna discover

219
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,120
 when we just stay here in the harbor.

220
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,080
 So we have to set out.

221
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,560
 And I'm excited about that.

222
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,160
 And excited to see, you know,

223
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,280
 what God is gonna open up for us

224
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,040
 as we head out together in this community,

225
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,200
 in our workplaces, and what opportunities

226
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,880
 he's gonna give us to give ourselves to,

227
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,560
 to be part of the work that he is doing

228
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,060
 of bringing his kingdom more fully on this earth.

229
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,560
 Now, let me take you to Matthew 13,

230
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,460
 quite well-known parables.

231
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,720
 Starting in verse 44, it says this.

232
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,640
 "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field.

233
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,560
 "When a man found it, he hid it again.

234
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,120
 "And then in his joy, he went out

235
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,160
 "and he sold all he had and bought that field."

236
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,760
 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant

237
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,480
 looking for fine pearls.

238
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,920
 "When he found one of great value,

239
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,400
 "he went away and sold everything he had and bought it."

240
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,480
 Now, the first parable suggests that the kingdom

241
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,400
 is something that we stumble across.

242
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,720
 The worker of the field, he was not like a treasure seeker

243
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,480
 with one of those metal detectors.

244
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,480
 He was actually just trying to earn his day's wage.

245
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,640
 And as he was going about his work,

246
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,580
 suddenly he discovered his treasure.

247
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,640
 So that's how in the first parable

248
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,500
 that the kingdom comes upon that person.

249
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,320
 And then in the second parable,

250
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,520
 it suggests that the kingdom is encountered

251
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,120
 because there are expected surprises.

252
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,840
 So this is somebody who's intentionally seeking.

253
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,480
 He's seeking for great pearls.

254
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,320
 It's a merchant, he knows what a good pearl looks like,

255
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,880
 but he has to wait until one comes.

256
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,880
 And as he sees the great one,

257
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,360
 then he knows what he's seeing and then he goes for it.

258
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,340
 So the kingdom of God comes, we stumble across it,

259
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,880
 but we also seek it out and then discover it

260
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,200
 because we're seeking it.

261
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,640
 So I think that's important for us in the season.

262
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,000
 So both parables, they also make the point

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,320
 that this is an opportunity

264
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,440
 and actually also requires us to respond decisively

265
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,320
 when we come across the kingdom,

266
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,980
 when we find that treasure,

267
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,180
 when we find that pearl of great value.

268
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,200
 And one thing that stood out to me

269
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,860
 was in the first parable,

270
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,920
 talks about that there is great joy of the discovery.

271
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,540
 And I think that's important for us

272
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,540
 because there is a great sacrifice.

273
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,260
 He sells everything that he has.

274
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,940
 The merchant sells everything that he has.

275
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,260
 By the way, the day laborer

276
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,360
 was not a particular wealthy man,

277
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,300
 was actually probably a person

278
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,900
 with not very many resources.

279
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,220
 And the merchant was probably a wealthy man, a businessman.

280
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,900
 But when he came across the opportunities,

281
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,660
 they had to give their all to respond to it,

282
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,460
 to have it, to be part,

283
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,840
 to experience this great joy and to really receive it.

284
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,900
 And so the price is high.

285
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,900
 It's not an easy, oh yeah, maybe I'll sell

286
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,100
 this piano that I don't like,

287
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,080
 but I'll keep the stand that I really like.

288
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
 I'm not gonna let go of this.

289
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,040
 I'm gonna hold on to my Pokemon card collection

290
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,200
 and I'll let go of something.

291
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,680
 No, it requires a full response,

292
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
 a full giving of ourselves

293
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,780
 in order to be part of what God is doing.

294
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,160
 And so there's a real cost,

295
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,200
 there's a real risk and chance taking

296
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,160
 in responding to the kingdom

297
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,320
 when God's reign and the work of God breaks upon us.

298
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,080
 Now, the same is true for us.

299
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,880
 I mean, we enter the kingdom,

300
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
 of course, when you come to faith,

301
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,720
 so there's a radical response

302
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,960
 because it means you're giving up your lordship

303
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,520
 instead of being lord of your own life, right?

304
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,220
 Instead of being lord of your own life, right?

305
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,500
 Your Jesus becomes your lord,

306
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,380
 so there's a significant shift in that.

307
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,740
 But then at later times,

308
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,480
 when the kingdom of God breaks into our lives,

309
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,200
 it still calls for a radical response.

310
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,540
 And like with the person who found a treasure in the field

311
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,060
 and the merchant who found this incredible pearl,

312
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,480
 they saw something that other people didn't see.

313
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,880
 They saw something of tremendous and incredible value.

314
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,540
 We could say they saw a better possible future.

315
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,060
 They saw this incredible thing that God was doing.

316
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,980
 They're like, "I'm gonna give myself to that.

317
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,140
 "I wanna be part of that.

318
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,940
 "I believe in this.

319
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,260
 "I wanna see this happening."

320
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,940
 And in order to be part of it

321
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,220
 and for this to be realized,

322
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,940
 we have to give ourselves to what God is doing.

323
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,900
 And there's a sacrifice in that.

324
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,020
 And that's how these things that God is doing,

325
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,860
 how he allows us to be part of what he's bringing about.

326
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:58,940
 And so in this season,

327
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,980
 there is great joy when we're gonna stumble

328
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,760
 across these things of the kingdom that God is doing,

329
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,700
 and there's also gonna be great joy

330
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,340
 because we're seeking it out and we see,

331
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,020
 wow, God is moving here,

332
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,460
 and I wanna be part of what God is doing there.

333
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,820
 And I think that's important

334
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,420
 because sometimes I feel like in church,

335
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,380
 it's like we're dreading,

336
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,660
 oh, we're being asked to sacrifice.

337
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,380
 I don't know if I wanna sacrifice.

338
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,060
 And I think the important part is God first

339
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,220
 shows you this amazing thing that he's doing.

340
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,980
 And there's great joy.

341
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,380
 It just stirs something within us.

342
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,960
 We're like, "Yes, I wanna be part of that.

343
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,060
 "I wanna see this thing happen."

344
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,340
 And that allows us to make the sacrifice

345
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,100
 because we see the beauty of the work of God.

346
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,940
 And so that's,

347
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,860
 there's this parable that kind of gives us a picture

348
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,860
 of how we need to enter and move

349
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,340
 into these uncharted waters.

350
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,940
 It's a season where we'll need to be both intentional

351
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,140
 seeking out the kingdom,

352
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,020
 but it's also, we need to also be ready

353
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,060
 to respond to these unexpected moves of God

354
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,500
 that we stumble across when they happen

355
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,980
 so we can say yes to them.

356
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:24,220
 And like these parables show, it takes decisive action.

357
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,800
 It doesn't just happen.

358
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:32,320
 Now, the Divine Church has a bold organizational practice.

359
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,540
 So we meet twice a month as a staff

360
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,140
 from One Shining Long together.

361
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,340
 And one of the things that people can do in the quarter

362
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,300
 is they can ask any question anonymously.

363
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,460
 Now, anonymously is always,

364
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,260
 you just don't know what you're gonna get, right?

365
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,860
 And there are tough questions,

366
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,620
 but it is really a way of opening a channel

367
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,140
 for truthful communication.

368
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,500
 And so early on in the church plan,

369
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,380
 one of the questions that was asked was,

370
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,620
 "What if the church plan fails?"

371
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:06,260
 And so then the question was given to me

372
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,580
 and then later to Ivan to address.

373
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:15,220
 And it was interesting because I was worried about things.

374
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,700
 I was worried, will we have enough people for a launch team?

375
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,000
 Will we figure out the location?

376
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,880
 So there was questions I was wondering about,

377
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,740
 but I didn't think of this church plan

378
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,460
 in terms of success and failure.

379
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,140
 But I'm glad the person asked the question

380
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,140
 because as we had a chance to think about it a little bit

381
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,060
 and then respond, it was really clear to me

382
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,700
 that God had moved, he had given us this envision,

383
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,060
 he had invited us into this work.

384
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,260
 And for me, failure would be not to respond

385
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,700
 to this thing that God is inviting us to do.

386
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,220
 For me, failure would be not to invest

387
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,680
 into the kingdom of God.

388
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,940
 And that would be failure.

389
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,260
 And so,

390
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,220
 so for me to fail is if the vine

391
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,540
 would never seek the planet church,

392
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,180
 reach the loss for the gospel of peace

393
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,980
 and hope or serve the vulnerable and marginalized.

394
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,260
 You know, for churches that just always play it safe,

395
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,640
 that never go for it,

396
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,460
 you know, we're missing out on what God wants to do.

397
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,940
 And so he gave us, he had us see this treasure,

398
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,800
 but then we had to give ourselves towards it

399
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,780
 to make it happen.

400
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,460
 And then whatever happens is up to him.

401
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,540
 We just need to be faithful in responding

402
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,020
 to what he asks us to do.

403
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,140
 And so this is what God is inviting us into.

404
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,140
 Now, I'm excited to invite up Ivan.

405
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,060
 He's gonna share with you something that we're sensing.

406
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,820
 So we have this theme of uncharted

407
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,140
 and he's gonna share with you a little bit,

408
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,420
 some of the things that are in his art.

409
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,820
 So Ivan, why don't you come up here?

410
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,900
 Let's welcome Ivan.

411
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,260
 (audience applauding)

412
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,180
 - Thank you, Pastor Tim.

413
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,860
 Yeah, let me share with you about a group of people

414
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,780
 in Hong Kong that lead us to take risks for.

415
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,820
 A group of people that are well setting out

416
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,540
 for into uncharted waters

417
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,700
 because the cost of staying in the harbor is too great.

418
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,580
 I would like to share a very interesting research

419
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,100
 about recent religions trends in Hong Kong.

420
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,580
 We can show the slide.

421
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,100
 A 2023 Peel Research Center,

422
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,140
 the report show that there are raised in religions,

423
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,340
 there is so that this affiliation

424
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,740
 in a wide spread trend in Hong Kong.

425
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,540
 You can see that we have 37% of people reporting

426
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,220
 they were raised in a religion

427
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,140
 but have left their childhood faith,

428
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,980
 which is the highest number in the whole Asia.

429
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,340
 Moreover, 30% of people,

430
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,380
 that are adult report that they were raised

431
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,820
 without a religion,

432
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,820
 while 61% currently identify as religiously unaffiliated.

433
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,980
 This representing a 31% of gain

434
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,620
 in people with no religions affiliation.

435
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,380
 The percentage of religiously unaffiliated

436
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,380
 grows even more dramatically among young adults age 18 to 34.

437
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,420
 You can see the number.

438
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,420
 74% they show that they are religiously unaffiliated.

439
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,340
 They are labeled as nones.

440
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,140
 That's mean they are loving in their religions.

441
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,420
 They're loving their low relationship with God, any God.

442
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,740
 This is a percentage showing that it is interesting enough

443
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,740
 to reflect the phenomenal with we have observed

444
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,620
 in the majority of local church in Hong Kong nowadays,

445
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,700
 especially for this group of age, younger generation.

446
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,700
 People have not only left the church,

447
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,380
 but also abandoned their faith.

448
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,620
 This group of young generation,

449
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,780
 they're not only just left their church in,

450
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,580
 stay in the church themself, the faith themself,

451
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,540
 but they left their faith.

452
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,500
 This is clearly a serious and critical situation

453
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,020
 for our younger generation.

454
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,820
 God led us to planet church in Yunnan two years ago.

455
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,740
 According to government data,

456
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,460
 Yunnan district is proceeded for continued growth,

457
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,460
 driven by new town development and strategic urban planning.

458
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,340
 The population of Yunnan in 2030,

459
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,420
 is projected to be 700,000.

460
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,980
 Can you imagine that?

461
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,300
 700,000 people in Yunnan district.

462
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,820
 With over 20%, which means more than 140,000

463
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,460
 being young adult age 18 to 34.

464
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,300
 Tim and I and Chairman, we are not in this group,

465
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,300
 so we can proudly to say that they're young generation.

466
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,540
 I saw that there's a lot of young generation

467
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,580
 among us as well.

468
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,700
 This demographic is a critical component of this growth.

469
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,180
 With chance, I indicated a preference

470
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,740
 for newer residential areas,

471
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,740
 offering more than amenities and affordability.

472
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,580
 Projection suggests that this district,

473
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,100
 Yunnan district, will continue to attract

474
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,260
 younger family and professionals.

475
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,900
 So maybe some of you, you may live in other district before,

476
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,380
 but you just move to this district

477
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,740
 because of different reason,

478
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,220
 but we can see that more and more young families

479
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,340
 and also young professional will come to this district

480
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,460
 and also we hope that we can really serve them.

481
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:27,140
 But where is this young people, spiritually?

482
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:33,420
 They are the missing piece of the church in Hong Kong,

483
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,260
 nowadays.

484
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,380
 They are the future of this city,

485
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,500
 but they cannot see the kingdom of God.

486
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,860
 They need a home, a spiritual home like us.

487
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,260
 What I want to emphasize is that we are in the best place,

488
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,540
 the best location, the best timing,

489
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,540
 the best moment to serve this group of younger generation.

490
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,260
 A spoken person from one of the biggest

491
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:09,460
 Hong Kong local research center told me that

492
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,260
 through their research, they found that the main reason

493
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,220
 why the younger generation left church,

494
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,820
 it's not about the context inside the church,

495
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,060
 it's not about the political stance,

496
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,100
 it's not about leadership issues.

497
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,620
 This younger generation left church

498
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,420
 is primarily because they couldn't see

499
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:38,300
 church making positive impact on this city.

500
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,100
 They couldn't see that this church,

501
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,660
 that religion as related to their lives.

502
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,260
 They couldn't see that the value of the church.

503
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:55,500
 So, church, this is time.

504
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,660
 This is the time for us as a church

505
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,060
 to humble now before God,

506
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,140
 to step up for our next generation, the younger generation,

507
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,180
 to let God be God of this city and his people,

508
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:16,180
 to lift up our voices and give up our own desires,

509
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,140
 to set ourselves aside for God

510
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,220
 and sacrifice all we have for his kingdom.

511
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,740
 This is a time for all people to praise

512
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,780
 and return the glory to God

513
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,500
 because God himself deserve all the glory, amen?

514
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:41,700
 There is a picture, that picture that totally facilitating me.

515
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,300
 Imagine there is a church,

516
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,380
 fully and faithfully investing in a group of younger people,

517
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,740
 loving them, caring them,

518
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,020
 like to encouraging them,

519
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,900
 empower them, discipling them,

520
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,740
 and also walk with them for all this,

521
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,420
 their journey to grow together.

522
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,980
 Imagine in the coming 20 years,

523
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,660
 there are 200 and 300 and 200 young people

524
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,700
 who have grown as big people.

525
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,620
 These people faithfully love their family.

526
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,420
 They wholeheartedly to serve the church

527
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:26,420
 and they impactfully, spiritually to impact this city.

528
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,220
 I believe that this city will definitely change

529
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,220
 with this group of people, they have been discipled, amen?

530
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,140
 Amen.

531
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,180
 So as a church like us,

532
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,700
 in this critical place, critical moment

533
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,380
 in Hong Kong, in this city, what shall we do?

534
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,460
 What shall we do this year?

535
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,500
 It doesn't mean that we need to serve

536
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,820
 like 140,000 people,

537
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,260
 but we believe that God has given us

538
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,940
 a specific calling to work for his kingdom.

539
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,860
 So let's welcome back like Pastor Tim

540
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,980
 to share what is our heart, what God put in our heart.

541
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,540
 - Thank you, Ivan, brilliant.

542
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,700
 Let's give him a hand.

543
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,860
 (audience applauding)

544
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,380
 Now, what might these uncharted waters look like for us?

545
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,460
 Well, the one thing that Ivan and I,

546
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,580
 and we did wrestle with this prayer fully

547
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,260
 for a very long time, but the one thing

548
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,260
 that we both, our spirits both jumped,

549
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
 is this young adults peace,

550
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,180
 where we just really sense God's heart

551
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,420
 for the young adults of the city

552
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,300
 and that we as a church need to step out,

553
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,860
 get uncomfortable and do something.

554
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,940
 And so in 2025, our heart is to plant

555
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,700
 a third Sunday service that is built

556
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,060
 on the foundation of young people.

557
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,540
 So we wanna get this young generation together

558
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,140
 and then from there launch a third service.

559
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,660
 And so we sense a strong call to invest

560
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,540
 in this next generation.

561
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,380
 Somebody has to do it.

562
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,420
 And we think we're positioned to do it.

563
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,060
 Now, going into uncharted territories,

564
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,700
 you know, it's not comfortable, it's not easy.

565
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,140
 It means getting out of our comfort zone.

566
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,020
 Like Ivan shared, there's, you know,

567
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,140
 the generation, a lot of the people

568
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,900
 in the generation feel like that.

569
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,540
 Like church doesn't matter.

570
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,740
 They don't see the relevance of faith

571
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,540
 and of God and of Jesus, you know,

572
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,100
 for their own lives and for the city.

573
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,740
 And so they just set it aside.

574
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,060
 And so our challenge is to find ways

575
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,580
 of showing and modeling, you know,

576
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,380
 that Jesus and following him and living for him,

577
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,700
 you know, is worth it.

578
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,140
 You know, that he does have an identity,

579
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,140
 a purpose for their lives and that it is beautiful

580
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,020
 and exciting and it is something worth

581
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,500
 giving themselves to.

582
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,220
 But for every generation, you have to find new ways

583
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,740
 of sharing this good news and of communicating this truth.

584
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,140
 And so there's gonna be some effort

585
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,460
 and some energy and some getting uncomfortable

586
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,180
 that will be needed for this uncharted work.

587
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:39,260
 But as I was preparing this, I just really had to sense,

588
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,500
 you know, someone got out of their comfort zone

589
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,700
 and got uncomfortable for your sake,

590
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,460
 to share the gospel with you.

591
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,780
 You know, somebody got uncomfortable for you.

592
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,380
 And so I just wondered, church,

593
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,740
 are we gonna be willing to be uncomfortable

594
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,020
 to share this beautiful gospel message?

595
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,260
 It's called, it's good news, right?

596
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,140
 Are we gonna be willing to be uncomfortable

597
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,380
 to share this good news with a generation

598
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,700
 that where many of them right now are nuns?

599
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,340
 But you just don't wanna affiliate

600
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,740
 with anything religious, let alone Jesus Christianity.

601
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,980
 So I think it's time for us to get uncomfortable,

602
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,940
 to go out, doesn't mean we have the answers

603
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,220
 of how to do all of this or how to do everything,

604
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,180
 but there's this call for us to go out.

605
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:36,180
 Now, how will we do it and what will also

606
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,580
 this third service look like?

607
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,900
 Well, in some sense, we don't know.

608
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,580
 We're called season uncharted.

609
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,300
 We have this one piece, young adults, third service,

610
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,020
 but how we're gonna get there, we don't know.

611
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,700
 And we actually wanted to also be careful

612
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,820
 not to put out strategies and plans.

613
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,100
 And I mean, we were involved in planting this church,

614
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,740
 so we have some ideas of what this could be like,

615
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,740
 but we felt that we needed to be careful

616
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,780
 and just hold our ideas loosely

617
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,940
 and just really be open for these things that God opens up.

618
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,380
 So we can say yes to them and follow the Holy Spirit's

619
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,660
 leading and not the old paths and the old ways,

620
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,940
 which maybe that's what God leads us on,

621
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,380
 but we go there because God leads us on,

622
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,340
 not because that's where past success was.

623
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:32,340
 So church, I'm so excited to step with you guys

624
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,980
 into this uncharted season.

625
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,820
 I do wanna share a little bit of what we can picture.

626
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,980
 We do picture, obviously, if you're a young adult here,

627
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,420
 we wanna talk to you and hear what is on your heart

628
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,700
 regarding your generation.

629
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,820
 You wanna just, yeah, just hear what you,

630
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,260
 what excites you about this vision.

631
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,740
 We can imagine getting you together

632
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,660
 like a young adults community,

633
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,060
 Sunday afternoons, or something like that.

634
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,180
 We can imagine running a young adults alpha

635
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,580
 that's specifically geared towards you.

636
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,660
 And so there's many things that we can imagine,

637
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,940
 but the only thing that's clear is young adults,

638
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,860
 third service, and then talking to you.

639
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,060
 So that's the starting point,

640
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,860
 and then we'll take it from there.

641
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:27,260
 Now, while that really is our big focus,

642
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,380
 in addition to that, I do wanna say that I believe

643
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,340
 that God will open up some opportunities this year as well

644
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:38,140
 that we cannot plan for, that we could not even know,

645
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,060
 but that he wants us to respond to.

646
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,420
 Maybe it's a third, maybe it's another mission partner,

647
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,340
 you know, an organization that we partner with

648
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,540
 and that we do incredible kingdom work in the city with.

649
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,500
 And so we also just wanna be ready for that as well.

650
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,060
 I just wanted to mention that.

651
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,700
 Now, I wanna invite the worship team to come up.

652
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:04,140
 So as we step into this uncharted season,

653
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,380
 there's gonna be things that we do not know yet

654
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,860
 about that God wants to do in and through us.

655
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,620
 But these things are only gonna happen, you know,

656
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,540
 if we are willing to go out,

657
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,620
 if we're willing to sail out on the boat

658
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,260
 in the uncharted waters.

659
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:24,380
 For me, it would be a pity if at the end of the year,

660
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:31,820
 we all never were uncomfortable for the kingdom's sake.

661
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,220
 You know, my heart is that we're willing to risk,

662
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,140
 to give God our all, you know,

663
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,620
 to make ourselves available to him

664
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,580
 for the things that he has for us.

665
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,740
 Now, this is not a time in Hong Kong's history

666
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,700
 for the church to be comfortable.

667
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,460
 There are so many young people who need to be impacted

668
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,180
 for the sake of the gospel.

669
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,260
 And if the church remains in this place of comfort,

670
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,180
 this will not happen.

671
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,980
 Come on, church.

672
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,620
 Let's do this, right?

673
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,140
 Yes.

674
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,980
 Now, because this is a time

675
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,140
 of calling us in the uncharted waters

676
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,540
 and being uncomfortable,

677
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,380
 I'm gonna do something

678
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,140
 that is a little bit uncomfortable for me,

679
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,340
 but I'm gonna do it anyhow,

680
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,780
 which is, you know, today is Vision Sunday.

681
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,780
 So we do ask that you give in response,

682
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,500
 you know, to this vision,

683
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,580
 to this thing that God has revealed to us,

684
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,060
 you know, for this year.

685
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,420
 And there is also a decisiveness that is needed in that.

686
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,420
 So I wanna invite you to prayerfully consider

687
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,420
 what God might be inviting you to give right now.

688
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,380
 You're giving as an investment in the future of Hong Kong,

689
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,780
 in the future generation of Hong Kong.

690
00:36:53,780 --> 00:37:00,300
 Your giving today will allow us to respond

691
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,220
 to the moves of God.

692
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,060
 'Cause like we said,

693
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,460
 we don't know when this discovery's made.

694
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,940
 Sometimes we stumble across it,

695
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,780
 sometimes we find it because we're seeking it out.

696
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,380
 But when we do,

697
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,100
 we wanna be able to respond

698
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,780
 and give ourselves fully to it.

699
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,420
 And so one way that we're able to do that

700
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,340
 is also through finances,

701
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,580
 you know, that we can respond

702
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,100
 to the things that we come across.

703
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,780
 So we wanna invite you to give.

704
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:28,540
 We're asking you today to give above and beyond

705
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,740
 your normal ties,

706
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,940
 to give towards this vision.

707
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,140
 So we're inviting you now to make an investment in the city

708
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,540
 that you love,

709
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,940
 that you are planted in,

710
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,300
 through the church that you are in.

711
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,900
 And every amount that you give today,

712
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,940
 it counts, you know, it matters.

713
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,620
 And the beauty of it is,

714
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:54,300
 is that we get to do this together as a family.

715
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,500
 We all get to get behind this vision together.

716
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,980
 So I invite you right now to give.

717
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,300
 I'm gonna say a prayer

718
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,420
 and then Chapman's gonna come up.

719
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,300
 He's gonna share a few more words after that.

720
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,420
 So let me pray for us church.

721
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,020
 Why don't we stand up?

722
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:23,780
 Jesus, we thank you so much

723
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,180
 that you love every single person here in the city,

724
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,380
 that you long for them to know you.

725
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,860
 Jesus, we thank you how you've been so faithful to us,

726
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,820
 how you've brought us here

727
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,460
 and all this amazing work that you've done.

728
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,860
 And we give you praise.

729
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,500
 Lord, I pray that you give us courage

730
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,300
 to respond to the moves of your spirit.

731
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,660
 His courage to get out of our comfort zones.

732
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,300
 Then as your kingdom breaks in,

733
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,900
 as your reign reveals itself,

734
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,820
 as what you're doing becomes clear, Lord,

735
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,460
 I pray that you stir excitement in our heart

736
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,220
 where we can see, wow, that is beautiful.

737
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,900
 I can see this better future.

738
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,220
 I wanna be part of it.

739
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,780
 Lord, I pray that you give us courage

740
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,620
 to give ourselves to this work that you're doing

741
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,860
 throughout all of our being,

742
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,460
 through our serving, through our giving.

743
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,460
 And Lord, may you use it for your glory.

744
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,020
 May you be honored this year by us, your church.

745
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,180
 And so we thank you that you speak to us.

746
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,860
 We thank you for this journey that we're on with you.

747
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,940
 And I pray this in your name, Jesus.

748
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,780
 Amen.

749
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:51,140
 You know, Church, just now I heard a little bit

750
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:56,140
 when Ivan included me in the not young anymore category.

751
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,700
 'Cause I felt I just left that age bracket,

752
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,860
 but that's the point.

753
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,780
 This is not just a vision for one particular age group.

754
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,980
 It's a vision for all of us,

755
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,180
 that no matter how old we are,

756
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,980
 no matter like in which life stage we're in,

757
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,780
 what background we came from,

758
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,220
 whether you're a parents or not,

759
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,660
 whether you're young or not,

760
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,540
 we can all participate in this vision.

761
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,220
 It's a vision for all of us.

762
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,060
 And so as a church leadership,

763
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,140
 we humbly come before you and share the word

764
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,100
 that God has impressed on our heart with you.

765
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,380
 And we humbly come before you and said,

766
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,780
 if you consider yourself part of this community,

767
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,780
 we do wanna invite you to invest in this vision together.

768
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,220
 Invest financially, invest prayerfully,

769
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,100
 with your time, with your strength, with your energy.

770
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,780
 If you decided to partner with us financially,

771
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,540
 there are a few ways you can do so.

772
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,180
 First of all, as usual,

773
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:05,260
 we have all the QR codes on the screen right now.

774
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,020
 If you give digitally,

775
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,380
 you can just scan one of these QR codes,

776
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,900
 whichever way it's convenient for you.

777
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,340
 Just want to highlight that to you,

778
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,620
 if you're using credit card or Octopus,

779
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,260
 when you open that giving page,

780
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,580
 you may see there are a few different categories.

781
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,900
 There is indeed one vision Sunday category,

782
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,700
 but that was for one choice.

783
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,220
 So if you wanna give to this vision,

784
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,940
 particularly in Yuen Long,

785
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,100
 you can continue to choose Yuen Long

786
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,500
 or Yuen Long general donation,

787
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,900
 you can choose that category.

788
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,540
 If you are giving by cash or check,

789
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,140
 and we do have an envelope on every chair in the room,

790
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,420
 you can pick that up, you can put it inside.

791
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,820
 We do have two boxes near the door,

792
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,660
 you can drop them off there.

793
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:53,660
 But I invite you, this is a vision for all of us.

794
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,340
 You can pray and ask God how He wants you

795
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,660
 to respond to that right now.

796
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,660
 So we're gonna have a time of worship.

797
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,580
 Nikki is gonna just gently sing over us,

798
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,500
 maybe use this time to think about,

799
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,980
 to pray and ask God,

800
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,940
 God, now this is a vision you have for the Vine Yuen Long.

801
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,740
 How would you want me to be a part of this,

802
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:23,220
 to be decisive, to join in this vision,

803
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,300
 to join in this next season

804
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,420
 where we're launching into the uncharted area.

805
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,900
 How do you want me to give?

806
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,820
 And so Holy Spirit,

807
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,380
 we just pray you would come and speak to us.

808
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,740
 We thank you that our vision of the church

809
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,300
 is not to grow a big service,

810
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,020
 not to grow just in numbers.

811
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,860
 We're here to grow big people,

812
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,260
 which means we're not just waiting

813
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,620
 for the third service to happen

814
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,500
 before we can reach out to these young generation.

815
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,900
 We're not waiting for pastors to stand on stage to preach

816
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,020
 or to lead a song so people's life could be changed.

817
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,780
 We're growing big people in this church.

818
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,460
 So if young people walk into this church,

819
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,380
 however, like whatever age we are,

820
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,660
 when we speak to them,

821
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,020
 they will be changed through a conversation

822
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,740
 with us, when they see Christ in us,

823
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,500
 when they join in a CG and they see how we love each other,

824
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,340
 how we pursue growth together.

825
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,220
 Father, we know that you would do something amazing,

826
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,780
 not just through Sundays,

827
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,740
 not just through services or events,

828
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,900
 but you're going to do it through each and every one of us

829
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,420
 in this community.

830
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,060
 And that's where sure.

831
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,780
 And so Father, we pray you would come and talk to us today.

832
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,460
 What do you have in store for this community,

833
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,300
 but also what you have in store for our lives?

834
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,820
 How do you want us to partner with you prayerfully,

835
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:53,100
 financially, spiritually, how we can give ourselves,

836
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,660
 how we can be like this,

837
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,660
 this people who sell everything to just pursue this treasure.

838
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,980
 How can we be a part of that?

839
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,260
 And so Holy Spirit,

840
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,700
 I just pray you would come and speak to us

841
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,140
 in the following moments.

842
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,540
 (soft music)

843
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:21,500
 Church, if you feel like you need time to prepare for that,

844
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,500
 you can ask God how he would want you to respond to this.

845
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:32,420
 I worship Tim,

846
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,500
 we'll just gently worship in the background as we do so.

847
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,020
 (soft music)

848
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,020
 [Music]
