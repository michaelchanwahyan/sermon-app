1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 Good morning.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,600
 Give me a wave if you're still with me after all that administration.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,960
 Come on, wave to me.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,640
 If somebody's fallen asleep next to you, just give them a little dig in the ribs.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,840
 Intimacy, deepening our trust and our faith.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,880
 I was recently on an overnight retreat

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,360
 and I'd been asked to do the devotional the next morning.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,720
 And I awoke in the middle of the night with these words in my head,

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,960
 "Switch from hope to faith."

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,480
 And I knew it was God and I immediately responded,

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,000
 "I'm sorry, I don't understand.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,680
 Do you ever do that with God? What are you saying?"

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,960
 I said to him, "You're going to have to explain this to me."

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,200
 God showed me that there were important areas of my life

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,520
 where I was asking in hope, not faith.

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,440
 Asking with no sense of assurance or conviction.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,760
 Hebrews 11, 1 tells us,

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,680
 "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for,

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,200
 the conviction of things not seen."

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,080
 Faith goes beyond just hope.

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,840
 God was asking me to deepen my faith,

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,480
 to ask in faith for the things that weighed heavy on my soul.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,520
 Now, how does this link to intimacy?

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,320
 Reaching for my journal that night

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
 and turning on the bedside lamp,

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,280
 God gave me this.

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,400
 Faith is built on trust.

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,760
 And trust comes from intimacy.

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,040
 So when we deepen our intimacy,

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,160
 trust deepens and our faith deepens.

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,440
 God showed me a personal area of my life

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,880
 where I was not asking with any faith

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,200
 or any sense of authority or conviction.

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,640
 I was asking in hope and in desperation,

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,200
 but with no sense of assurance.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,320
 Now, there is nothing wrong with hope,

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,320
 but I sense God challenging me to shift from just hope

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,760
 to praying from a place of greater trust and greater faith.

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,680
 You see, we all have areas of our life

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,640
 where trust has been eroded in God's ability to bring change.

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,960
 Just think for a moment about your life.

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,800
 Areas in your life where your trust

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,560
 in God's ability to bring change has been eroded.

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
 In this intimate counter that I had in the middle of the night,

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,160
 God showed me his great love

46
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,600
 for the situation I had lost faith in.

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,320
 And he showed me his grief,

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,920
 which matched my own and surpassed my own.

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,200
 In that moment, as everything was stripped bare,

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,000
 I was gently brought to a place of repentance.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,360
 My trust restored in a God who does know and who does care.

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,680
 I was able to ask in faith concerning this situation

53
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,920
 and able to ask with assurance and conviction.

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,560
 Matthew 21, 22 reminds us that whatever we ask in prayer,

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,640
 we will receive if we have faith.

56
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,000
 We as a church and we as individuals

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,160
 have been called to intimacy.

58
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,600
 It is the foundation on which everything else is built.

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,800
 When Jesus was asked, "Teacher,

60
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,560
 what is the greatest commandment in the law?"

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,240
 Jesus responded, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,920
 and with all your soul and with all your mind.

63
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:14,000
 This is the first and greatest commandment."

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,680
 The first and greatest commandment.

65
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,040
 If you leave with nothing else today, leave with this.

66
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,840
 The first and greatest thing you need is intimacy with God.

67
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,560
 Life for you may not be going to plan right now.

68
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,600
 Maybe you're feeling quite distant, unloved, lonely.

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,680
 Love the Lord your God with all your heart

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,920
 and all your soul and all your mind.

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,160
 Come back to the first and greatest commandment.

72
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,480
 I recently read in a Facebook post of one of my friends

73
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,680
 these words, "God is aware of all of our shortcomings,

74
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,560
 but he's never changed his mind about us."

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,520
 We change our minds about God,

76
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,240
 we're often quite fickle and unreliable.

77
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,200
 But God's desire for intimacy with you has never changed.

78
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,880
 So why is intimacy the foundation on which our faith,

79
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,560
 our trust, our life is to be built on?

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,320
 What does intimacy do in our life?

81
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,080
 Before I go any further, I just want to share a truth

82
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,720
 about intimacy.

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
 Recently, I caught up with a friend

84
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,480
 and she was sharing about her journey with God.

85
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,560
 I came away and I remember saying to God,

86
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,200
 "Wow, she really has an intimate relationship with you,

87
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,600
 more intimate than me.

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,480
 Maybe someone like that should be preaching this message."

89
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,240
 God's immediate response was, "Not more intimate,

90
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,880
 just different.

91
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,280
 Every person's intimacy with me looks different."

92
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,160
 And this is really important.

93
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,560
 Don't compare.

94
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,280
 Just as couples' relationships look different

95
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,480
 and people express their love for each other

96
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,360
 in different ways, the same goes with our relationship

97
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,400
 with God.

98
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,640
 No two relationships are going to look the same

99
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,080
 and neither should they.

100
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,160
 Now, why is intimacy so foundational to our lives?

101
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,640
 In intimate moments, it is like a mirror is held up to God

102
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,800
 and we see him as he truly is.

103
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,960
 At the same time, that mirror is held up to us

104
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,240
 and we see ourselves as we truly are.

105
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,960
 Everything gets stripped away, our false thinking,

106
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,160
 everything that separates crumbles away.

107
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,160
 In intimate moments with God, it's like we see clearly

108
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,760
 and we hear clearly.

109
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,960
 Everything gets exposed, the goodness of God,

110
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,560
 the faithfulness of God, the love of God.

111
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,040
 And our frailties get exposed.

112
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,600
 Our sin gets exposed.

113
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,280
 Like looking into a mirror, we see ourselves truly

114
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,840
 and we see God truly.

115
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,640
 Faced with the overwhelming goodness of God

116
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,520
 and the overwhelming truth of our need for him,

117
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,080
 we are often gently led to repentance.

118
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,920
 But our frailties and our sin are not the only things

119
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,280
 that get exposed when we have intimate moments with God.

120
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,320
 He also reveals to us our value.

121
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,960
 He reminds us how precious we are to him.

122
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,000
 Reflected in the mirror, we often see clearly

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,320
 what needs to change in us.

124
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,480
 2 Corinthians 318 captures this beautiful transformation

125
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:34,040
 process that takes place in intimate moments with God.

126
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,680
 And we all, with unveiled face, continually seeing

127
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,440
 as in a mirror the glory of the Lord,

128
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,080
 are progressively being transformed into his image,

129
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,040
 from one degree of glory to even more glory,

130
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,960
 which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.

131
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,000
 We emerge from intimate moments with God

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,280
 with greater trust, a greater assurance of God,

133
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,160
 which leads to a stronger, more assured faith.

134
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,040
 So what does your intimacy with God look like?

135
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,840
 The imagery that came through Pastor Andrew's dream,

136
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,040
 which this sermon series of intimacy was built on,

137
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,520
 was of two armchairs facing each other,

138
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,640
 of you and God sitting face to face,

139
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,840
 not just hoping for but knowing his nearness,

140
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,960
 being assured that his gaze is on you.

141
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,640
 Does your intimacy with God need to deepen?

142
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,600
 Is your faith and trust eroded?

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,400
 Do you need to shift your chair?

144
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,400
 Is your armchair at the moment in the same room as God's,

145
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,880
 but it's not facing him directly?

146
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,880
 Or are you even in the room with God?

147
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,880
 Is your armchair even in the room with God?

148
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,880
 I've been a Christian since I was 10,

149
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,880
 and in my journey, I've seen many friends and loved ones

150
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,880
 put their armchair into storage.

151
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,880
 What I mean by that is,

152
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,880
 is that along the way, their faith and trust gets eroded,

153
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,880
 and their armchair, they just kind of put it away.

154
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880
 I've even had some of them say to me,

155
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,880
 "Well, if God's real, he can just turn up in my life,

156
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
 "but I'm not gonna seek him anymore.

157
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
 "He can just turn up."

158
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,880
 And in my heart, I'm thinking,

159
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,880
 "It's not God that's moved.

160
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,880
 "He's still there in his armchair.

161
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
 "It's you that's moved."

162
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,880
 Maybe you've given up completely,

163
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,880
 or maybe today you haven't even started your journey with God.

164
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,880
 If either of these are true,

165
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,880
 then you need to know today that he loves you.

166
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,880
 His heart has never changed towards you.

167
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,880
 He is inviting you into a loving relationship with him today.

168
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,880
 For those of you who do know Jesus,

169
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,880
 what are the areas in your life where you've lost faith?

170
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,880
 Or your faith in God's ability to bring change

171
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,880
 has become eroded?

172
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,880
 Are there areas in your life that you feel

173
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,880
 you just can't trust God with that?

174
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,880
 God has not changed his mind about us.

175
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,880
 He tells us that there is nothing

176
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,880
 that can separate us from his love.

177
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,880
 A love that seeks us out,

178
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,880
 pursues us,

179
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,880
 waits patiently for us to choose

180
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
 to love him with all our hearts,

181
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,880
 and all our souls, and all our minds.

182
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,880
 He has already chosen you wholeheartedly.

183
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,880
 And he longs for you to choose him in the same way,

184
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,880
 wholeheartedly.

185
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,880
 So if God's intimacy is always available to us,

186
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,880
 if his armchair is always pulled up near,

187
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,880
 waiting for us to join him,

188
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,880
 if he is ever seeking us out,

189
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,880
 what is preventing you today

190
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,880
 from drawing near?

191
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,880
 Just stop and think for a moment.

192
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,880
 Those of you in this room

193
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,880
 that at some point have come to know Jesus,

194
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,880
 what impacts on your intimacy with God,

195
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,880
 and ultimately your trust and your faith?

196
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,880
 Those of you who don't know God,

197
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,880
 what is preventing you today from accepting his love for you,

198
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,880
 his invitation to you?

199
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,880
 Is it busyness or burnout?

200
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,880
 Does that impact on your relationship with God,

201
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
 your busyness,

202
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,880
 or are you in a place of burnout?

203
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,880
 Elijah experienced both these things.

204
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
 And just like Elijah,

205
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,880
 God can still meet you in the midst of your circumstances.

206
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,880
 Is it insecurity,

207
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,880
 feeling like you're just not good enough?

208
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,880
 Does this impact on your relationship with God and your intimacy with him?

209
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,880
 Moses felt like this.

210
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
 He didn't feel good enough.

211
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
 He ran away.

212
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
 He hid in the desert.

213
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,880
 But God still found him there.

214
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,880
 What about fear?

215
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,880
 Does fear impact your intimacy with God?

216
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,880
 Gideon was someone in the Bible experiencing fear.

217
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,880
 And God still found him in his hiding place.

218
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,880
 What about shame?

219
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,880
 Peter was full of shame.

220
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,880
 And God tracked him down.

221
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:04,880
 He cooked him breakfast and invited him back into his armchair.

222
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,880
 What about pride?

223
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:16,880
 Are you still holding on too strongly to control of your life?

224
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,880
 Jonah thought that he knew a better way than God.

225
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,880
 And God pursued him.

226
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:34,880
 And he taught him that his way always works out better in our lives.

227
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,880
 There's a beautiful story in the Bible that I love.

228
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
 It's the woman who's caught in adultery.

229
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
 That's not the part I love.

230
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:51,880
 The part I love is that this woman is experiencing rejection and she's caught in sin.

231
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,880
 And Jesus meets her there in the dirt.

232
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,880
 And he lifts her head.

233
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,880
 He forgives her.

234
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,880
 What about grief or disappointment?

235
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,880
 Disillusionment?

236
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,880
 Loss?

237
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,880
 Naomi in the Bible experienced all these things.

238
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:32,880
 In the darkest of journeys, God met her and he crafted a new beginning for her.

239
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,880
 Let me share with you the one that impacts my intimacy that I wrestle with the most.

240
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
 Laziness.

241
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,880
 A nicer word is procrastination.

242
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,880
 Put up your hand if you're brave enough to join me on that.

243
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
 Procrastinating, yeah.

244
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,880
 There's a few of us.

245
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,880
 Glad I'm not on my own.

246
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:04,880
 You see, intimacy requires intentionality and it requires our time.

247
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,880
 It requires a slowing down of our fast-paced, crowded minds and hearts.

248
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,880
 The verse we shared earlier speaks of loving God with all of our hearts

249
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,880
 and with all our souls and with all our minds.

250
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,880
 That means that some things have to get out of the way.

251
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,880
 Some things that have taken up space in our hearts and our souls and our minds

252
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,880
 need to get out of the way.

253
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,880
 Whatever our reasons today, whatever the things are that impact our intimacy,

254
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,880
 many times we don't want to look into the mirror.

255
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,880
 We're afraid of his conviction, afraid of his challenge,

256
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:06,880
 scared of what he might ask us to give up or surrender.

257
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,880
 Proverbs 3 verses 5 to 6 say, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart.

258
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,880
 Lean not on your own understanding.

259
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,880
 In all your ways submit to him and he will make your paths straight."

260
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,880
 Trust today that the Lord knows you better than you know yourself.

261
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:34,880
 He also knows what you need better than you know yourself.

262
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,880
 Trust today that he's a good father.

263
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,880
 Intimate encounters with God change the course of our lives.

264
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,880
 They form the foundations on which everything else is built,

265
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,880
 like faith and trust.

266
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,880
 I want to share an intimate encounter that I had with God with you

267
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,880
 to show you how it can change the course of your life

268
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,880
 and actually become foundational.

269
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,880
 So in my 20s I was at a conference and I had joined the kind of worship,

270
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,880
 learning about worship, being involved in worship strain that you could choose.

271
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,880
 And part of it was that at the end you got to sing as part of the massive choir

272
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
 at this conference.

273
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,880
 So I'm on stage as part of this huge choir and we're singing this song,

274
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,880
 "He's a Father to the Fatherless."

275
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,880
 Now if you know my story, I was put up for adoption at two weeks old.

276
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,880
 So we're singing this song, "He's a Father to the Fatherless,

277
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
 the answer to my prayer."

278
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,880
 And as I sang those words it was like a video reel went on in my head

279
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,880
 and I could see this video playing out.

280
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,880
 And God showed me that at two weeks of age,

281
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,880
 he showed me lying in a crib in the hospital where I had been put up

282
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,880
 for adoption and I was crying in the crib because I knew that whoever

283
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,880
 had been holding me was no longer there.

284
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,880
 And God showed me that he walked into that room,

285
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,880
 he put his hands on the crib and he leant over me and he said,

286
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,880
 "I will be your father.

287
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,880
 And what the enemy has determined for evil in your life,

288
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,880
 I will turn it around for good."

289
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,880
 And in this moment, standing in this choir,

290
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,880
 it was like rejection and the things that I had battled,

291
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,880
 I was quite a people pleaser because I was so insecure about my own

292
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,880
 self-worth, I would crave it from other people.

293
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,880
 So I'd try to please them so that they would, you know,

294
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,880
 pat me on the back and tell me how good I was.

295
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,880
 But in that moment that God showed me his great love for me and that he was

296
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,880
 in my story, that he had chosen to be my father,

297
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,880
 it was like the rejection thing got turned off.

298
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,880
 And I was so sure of my value.

299
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,880
 And from that moment on, that became a foundation on which I

300
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,880
 could build the rest of my relationship with God and my relationship with

301
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,880
 others, that complete security that I was valued and I was known and I was

302
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:46,880
 loved and I was wanted.

303
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,880
 God today is inviting us all to deepen our intimacy with him and our

304
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,880
 trust and our faith in him.

305
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,880
 And we're going to take some time today to lean into that.

306
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,880
 I'm going to invite the musicians and singers to come.

307
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,880
 So what we're going to do as we end this service is we're going to close

308
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,880
 our eyes and we're each going to imagine those two armchairs.

309
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,880
 Now some of you may have to rearrange your armchair because maybe it's not

310
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
 quite facing God at the moment.

311
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,880
 Maybe you have to get it out of storage.

312
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,880
 But we're going to visualize those two armchairs and we're going to

313
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:43,880
 visualize ourselves facing God.

314
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,880
 You can have an intimate encounter with God anywhere.

315
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,880
 This week I was on the bus to school, the E41 that takes me to Taipo,

316
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,880
 and I visualized myself sitting in an armchair with God facing me sitting

317
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,880
 in his armchair.

318
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,880
 And he said to me, "Susanna, I love you."

319
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,880
 And I went to turn my head because sometimes you're embarrassed when you

320
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:20,880
 realize how much you're loved and how much we can let God down because we

321
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,880
 don't give him back the same level of love.

322
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,880
 But as I went to turn my head in shame, he gently drew my head back and he

323
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
 said, "Don't look away.

324
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,880
 Hold my gaze.

325
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
 Let's do this together."

326
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,880
 And he held my hands.

327
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,880
 Today when you visualize that armchair, don't turn your face away.

328
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,880
 Hold his gaze.

329
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
 You're not alone.

330
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,880
 He'll do it with you, together.

331
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,880
 He loves you.

332
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,880
 So we're going to take some time now.

333
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,880
 The music will just play in the background.

334
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,880
 Shut out every distraction.

335
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,880
 You are so important to God.

336
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,880
 He's waiting for you.

337
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,880
 And if you choose to sit in that armchair, know that he will be right there

338
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
 with you.

339
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,880
 And he's got something to say to you today.

340
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
 It might come as a picture.

341
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,880
 It might come as one gentle word.

342
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,880
 But he's got something for you today.

343
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,880
 So we're going to take some time to be intimate with him.

344
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,360
 him.
