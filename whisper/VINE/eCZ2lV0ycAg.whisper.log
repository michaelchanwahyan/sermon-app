[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.600]   Good morning.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.960]   Happy New Year.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.720]   Here we are at the start of a new year.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.720]   Thank you, Carla.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720]   Beautiful.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.720]   All right.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.920]   It's good to be back.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.040]   My family and I, we've been away on sabbatical for a little while, and so it wasn't very
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.640]   restful when you're traveling with two little kids, but we had a lot of fun family time
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.640]   together.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.440]   But I'm so glad to be back with everybody and getting into the swing of things, Christmas,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.360]   and of course, looking towards 2024.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.960]   We're going to be in Philippians chapter three today, so if you want to follow on the screen,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.520]   it's going to come up on there, or if you have a Bible or a device that you can read
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.920]   from, I'm going to invite you to listen as I read Philippians chapter three, starting
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.480]   in verse seven.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.760]   Word of the Lord says this, "But whatever were gains to me, I now consider loss for
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.920]   the sake of Christ.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.360]   What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.440]   Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.720]   I consider them garbage that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.480]   of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.040]   that comes from God on the basis of faith.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.840]   I want to know Christ, yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.600]   sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so somehow attaining to the resurrection
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.760]   from the dead.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.240]   Not that I have already attained all of this, or already have arrived at my goal, but I
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.520]   press on to take hold of that which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.160]   Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken a hold of it, but one thing
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.360]   I do, forgetting what is behind, straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.080]   goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus."
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.960]   So here we are, church, on the cusp of a new year.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.200]   Goodbye 2023, hello 2024.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.040]   For some of us, New Year's Eve is very exciting.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.880]   Let me tell you how it's going to go down at my house tonight.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.080]   After services today, I'm going to call Dobro's, I'm going to walk over to that little shop
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.360]   in Wan Chai, pick up my pizzas, we're going to go home and have pizza for dinner because
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.240]   it's super easy, put the kids to bed, I'm going to open a bottle of wine and then doom
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.440]   scroll Instagram for a little bit until I get a bit tired, then I'm going to put on
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.680]   a movie, I'll fall asleep on the sofa inevitably, wake up at 1am or the baby will wake me up,
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.200]   take a look at my watch, oh it's 2024 and go back to sleep.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.780]   I know how to party, that's how it's going to go down at my house.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.960]   But for you, for you out there, maybe you have champagne in the fridge right now, I
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.360]   know Hudson does, definitely.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.080]   Fancy dress party to attend later.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.000]   Perhaps some of you in this room or watching online, you're planning to ask the big question
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.240]   tonight, okay?
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.520]   Some of you today are going to be ringing in 2024, okay?
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.240]   And it's all going to be good, it's going to be a celebration.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.800]   Maybe that's you tonight, I don't know.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.600]   For some of us, 2023 has been a great year.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.440]   You've hit your goals, you've landed that dream job, you've met the person that you've
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.880]   been wanting to meet.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.320]   And as you look ahead, it's looking good.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.040]   There is so much to look forward to.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.400]   So tonight, as Prince tells us to do, we're going to party like it's 1999.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.440]   However, dates like New Year's Eve are difficult for some of us.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.160]   Because instead of looking forward to celebration and the excitement that's to come, tonight
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.380]   you're going to be reminded of how tough the past year has been.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.820]   And as you look ahead, the forecast is just more disappointment.
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.800]   And 2023 hasn't been kind, and it's hard to see how things are going to change.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.640]   And so Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, dates like this, it's just a painful reminder of
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.920]   pain and sadness.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.640]   So as we look towards 2024, I'm not here to tell you today it's just going to be a best
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.640]   year ever, okay?
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.420]   I'm not going to say that because I have no idea, we have no idea how this year is going
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.420]   to turn out.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.080]   Like I said, for some it's going to be awesome.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.960]   All your hopes and dreams and prayers are going to come through.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.760]   But for some it's going to be a storm.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.920]   And I don't know if things are going to get better.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.040]   But wherever we are in this journey, my hope for today, as we end this year, is going to
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.020]   be an encouragement and a challenge for everybody.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.740]   And yes, I understand we don't have to wait till New Year's Eve to do something like this,
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.060]   but today is Sunday.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.060]   We are gathered.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.340]   It does happen to be New Year's Eve.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.540]   So we have an opportunity to hear from the Lord about the things that have passed and
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.500]   the things that are yet to come.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.060]   And what I do know is this, what I do know is no matter what life looks like for you
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.020]   right now, in this moment, in this season, there is an attitude, there's a frame of mind
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:31.420]   and a faith that Jesus wants us to step into as we look towards 2024.
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.020]   A foundation for us to build the next 365 days on.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.580]   Some framework for you to think about as we step into the fast.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.740]   And so whether or not 2024 brings you to the top of the mountains where you're celebrating
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:51.780]   or leaves you struggling in the valleys, we can be sure about our goals and our purposes
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.660]   for this year.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.740]   So let's go back to the passage we're looking at today.
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.540]   Let's see what it has to say.
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.500]   Verse 7, "Wherever were gains to me, I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.980]   What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.460]   Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.380]   I consider them garbage that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having a righteousness
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.100]   of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.220]   that comes from God on the basis of faith."
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.220]   So let me ask you this.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.700]   If someone were to ask you, "How do you measure how successful your year has been?"
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.700]   What would you say?
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.140]   I'm preaching for this iPad and it messes up on me.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.140]   Hang on a second.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.140]   Normally I use paper.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.140]   New year, new me.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.940]   It's not working out so far.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.940]   Hang on.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.940]   Okay, here we go.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.940]   Okay.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.940]   What would you say?
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.380]   How would you measure how successful your year has been?
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.380]   What would be your answer?
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.820]   Well, if you're a fan of musical theater, you might say this.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:07.020]   In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee, in inches, in miles, in laughter,
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:14.340]   and in strife, 525,000.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.540]   Many times when we look at life, we measure it by achievements, things we have done.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.460]   So as you look back towards 2023 and how successful it was, you might start by asking yourself
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.500]   the question, "Did I achieve all the things I set out to achieve?
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.660]   Did I hit all my goals?"
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.660]   Right?
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.740]   The internet, social media is going to be full of memes about this.
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.340]   You know the ones that say, right, "How it started, how it's going," right?
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.580]   And so as the year comes to an end, okay, not great for these guys, okay?
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:51.620]   You promise.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.780]   As the year comes to an end, you might have been on this process yourself, seeing how
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.020]   well you've hit your 2023 goals.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.300]   Now goals can be a good thing.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:06.380]   In fact, here at the Vine, as a church, as a ministry, we have a process for setting
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.620]   goals for ourselves personally and professionally, right?
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.340]   We do this as a way to keep focus on the things that are important.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.540]   It gives us a way to measure whether or not we're heading in the right direction, keeps
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.340]   us accountable to the things that we said we were going to do at the beginning of the
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.900]   year.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.020]   And when we hit those goals, it's awesome, right?
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:34.120]   Setting that new personal best for a fitness goal and finally reaching that, that's great.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.300]   Buying the dream car, getting that promotion, paying off that debt, whatever it is, when
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.660]   we reach our goals, there's an undeniable sense of achievement.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.860]   It feels good.
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.740]   And so now as you look towards 2024, you might have already made a list of goals, resolutions
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.340]   to start the new year with.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.980]   We make these declarations of the things we want to achieve at the beginning of a new
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.180]   year.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.460]   And like I said, it can be a good thing.
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.700]   In fact, for some of us in this room and some of us watching online, you'd be doing yourself
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:11.740]   a great favor by setting some real goals this year so that the next 365 days don't just
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.180]   go aimlessly sailing by.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.540]   At the same time though, if we make reaching these earthly goals the only thing, if hitting
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.620]   goals is a standard that we focus on, I don't think that's very healthy either.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.980]   And I don't think that's the way Jesus calls us to live our lives.
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:36.020]   And by the way, statistics show us that only 9% of people who make resolutions manage to
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.980]   see them through till the end of the year, which means that for most of us this year,
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.820]   we've already failed before it started.
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.620]   Which is why when Paul says, "But whatever were gains to me, I now consider loss for
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.940]   the sake of Christ," it's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.540]   Because this was a man who had hit all his goals.
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.980]   This was a man who achieved everything you could imagine to achieve and then some more.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.800]   Listen to how he describes himself in Philippians chapter three a bit earlier, just the verses
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.300]   before this, 4 to 6.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:13.780]   "If someone else thinks they have reason to put confidence in the flesh, I have more.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:18.500]   Circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.900]   of Hebrews in regard to the law, a Pharisee.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.260]   As for zeal, persecuting the church.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260]   As for righteousness based upon the law, faultless."
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.300]   In 2023 translation, this is what he's saying.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.740]   "If you think you've done a lot with your life, trust me, it's nothing compared to what
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.900]   I've done.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.660]   I'm the best of the best.
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.340]   I'm the creme de la creme.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.340]   If you look at my resume, it's perfect.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.820]   I'm the guy you aspire to be.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:50.620]   I've done and achieved things you can only dream of doing yourself."
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.580]   But there's something important to note here.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.500]   As much as he's achieved, what Paul is saying here, it's not the things that he achieved
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.220]   are of no value at all.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.940]   He recognizes that these goals, these achievements he has are of great value.
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.440]   They are important.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.800]   These things were precious to him, but yet he's still willing to throw it all away.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.220]   In other words, what Paul is saying, Paul is not throwing away rubbish in order to gain
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.340]   Christ.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:25.060]   He is throwing the things away that were extremely important to him in order to gain Christ.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.180]   This is why his testimony is so remarkable.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:33.420]   What Paul is saying that the best achievements he's gained in his life have become meaningless
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.580]   to him, that all the goals that he's reached are rubbish.
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.420]   Why?
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.980]   The answer is powerful but simple.
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.860]   He has a new goal, and that's Jesus.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.660]   So in a world and a culture that puts so much focus on achievement, it seems like such a
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:58.540]   ridiculous thing to do, especially if you've achieved so much.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.100]   But this is exactly the challenge that lies before us today.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.860]   So let me ask us this, church, before or ahead of all the goals you want to see happen in
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:14.540]   2024, are we willing to put Jesus first?
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.780]   Paul's not talking about giving everything for the sake of nothing.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.460]   There's a reason and a motivation.
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:25.060]   He hasn't gone crazy, although some might say he has lost his mind, but there's a motivation
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.140]   to do what he is doing.
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.420]   He is willing to give up everything because he has found something that's worth more than
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.380]   all these things put together.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:41.220]   And Paul is giving up everything because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus,
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.220]   my Lord.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:49.100]   Paul is giving up everything so he can walk in true righteousness.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.940]   You see, he recognizes he had a righteousness once.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.540]   He was perfect, he says, in following the law.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.860]   But his righteousness wasn't one from God.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.260]   It was one that was done by his own power.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:08.460]   But now he recognizes there's a better righteousness, one that he could never achieve on his own,
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.380]   one that can only be given through life in Jesus.
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.340]   Paul is giving up everything so that he could have a life that is not defined by personal
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:24.140]   achievements, but is a life that is lived, defined through faith in Christ.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:30.500]   He's choosing to give up even the best things so he could receive something better.
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:37.460]   At the risk of repeating myself, we have to understand Paul gave up everything, everything,
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:43.260]   his comfort, his reputation, the trajectory that was his, his money, his power, his identity,
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:50.180]   so that he could have a deeper and more intimate relationship with Jesus.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.100]   And where do you think he got this example from?
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.300]   Because by the way, isn't this what Jesus did for us?
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.340]   Isn't this what we just celebrated at Christmas?
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:06.660]   Jesus who gave up his position in heaven, who made himself nothing, taking on the nature
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:15.100]   of a servant, humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.820]   Why?
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:23.340]   So then he could pave the way for us to have an intimate relationship with him.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.700]   So let me ask this again.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.020]   I'm going to phrase it more directly towards ourselves this morning.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:33.900]   Are you willing to let go of all things, even your best things, even your most precious
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.260]   things in order to gain Jesus?
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:43.220]   Could this be the one goal you give yourself above all other goals?
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:49.340]   If the answer is yes, and I hope it is, we're going to talk about how to do this a little
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.340]   bit.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:55.820]   Because after, like I said, after giving up our most precious things, we gain something.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.380]   This passage gives us new goals to aim towards.
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:06.380]   Paul says this, "I want to know Christ, to know the power of his resurrection and participations
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:12.340]   in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so somehow attaining to the resurrection
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.480]   of the dead."
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.740]   So like I said, if you want some new goals for 2024, if you're looking for some framework
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:27.460]   to walk towards in your fast, this might be helpful for you right now.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.820]   First thing is this, to know Christ.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.540]   To know Christ.
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:38.780]   When Paul speaks of knowing Christ, this of course is more than just a general knowledge.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.980]   It's more than just an intellectual awareness.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:46.980]   But to know Christ is to be in relationship with him.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.420]   Many of us in this room, we might know a lot about who Christ is.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.140]   In fact, we might know a lot about a lot of people.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.980]   I follow Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson on Instagram, right?
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.260]   And I know sometimes he posts what he's doing.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.260]   I wouldn't say I know him.
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:05.020]   I mean, I know we have a similar physique, but apart from that, I don't know him that
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.020]   well, right?
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.300]   So I wouldn't say I was friends with him.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.380]   So I'll say this again.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:16.660]   To know Christ means we have to be in relationship with him.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:21.140]   Not just being a part of a church, not just coming to Sunday services, attending Bible
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.140]   studies.
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:28.100]   The call here is not to know about Jesus, but to know him in a way that actually shapes
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.000]   and directs your life.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.040]   My family in Christ.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.820]   Do you truly know Jesus?
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:44.900]   Now, in order to truly know Jesus, you must also participate in this next step, to know
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:51.260]   this thing, to know the power of his resurrection.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:56.580]   The most powerful display of God's love was shown to us when Jesus sacrificed himself
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.440]   on the cross.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:04.140]   But the most powerful display of God's power was shown to us when Jesus was resurrected
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.960]   from the dead.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:12.400]   And so if we truly want to walk in the life-changing relationship with Jesus in a way that actually
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.900]   shapes and directs our life, if we really want that, we have to understand that we do
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:25.980]   that by the power, the same power that raised Jesus from the dead lives in you.
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:32.180]   That's what empowers you to live a life-changing relationship with Jesus.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:37.220]   But again, I think this is something we sometimes underestimate or forget about.
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.220]   We do.
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:42.220]   We underestimate what we can do in the name of Jesus.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.780]   So we forget about this resurrection power.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.500]   It makes us timid in our faith.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.260]   We get scared.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.940]   We start to think that there's certain things that God can't do.
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.340]   But let's not forget, church, with God, what things are possible?
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.660]   All things are possible.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:06.460]   The biggest mountains of struggle in our lives that seem so insurmountable, God can move
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.740]   that mountain.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.740]   All things.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.280]   But here's the great mystery.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:20.700]   At the same time, the power of resurrection in our lives also works in more subtle ways.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.860]   Resurrection power might work in your way, in your life, like giving you encouragement
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.420]   in time of need.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.820]   It might give you the courage to have that conversation with the person that you know
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.100]   is struggling in their faith.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.620]   It might give you the wisdom and the patience to sit next to someone who's going through
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.060]   pain.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:43.860]   It might give you a generous spirit to give away things, to help someone without anyone
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.100]   ever knowing a thing about it.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:52.740]   It might not be as loud, but it's definitely as powerful.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:19:01.140]   So my question for us in this, do you want to know the power of resurrection in your
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.940]   life?
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:08.380]   Do you want to know Jesus, and do you want to know the power of his resurrection in your
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.260]   life?
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.560]   All this, of course, is gonna ask something for us.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:22.340]   And it's going to require you to, and Paul says, participate in suffering.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:27.680]   Now why would we want to participate in suffering?
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:34.020]   If we truly want to know Jesus and his power, then it's not just all about warm, fuzzy feelings,
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.700]   walking in his blessings, being encouraged, gathering community, as beautiful and as necessary
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.100]   as these things are.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.640]   There is also, church, a call to suffer.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.980]   To know Jesus fully means we must be able to relate what it means to suffer.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:56.640]   Jesus himself says this, "Don't be surprised if people hate you.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.760]   Take up your cross, then follow me."
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:05.400]   To the rich young ruler, he says, "If you want to follow me for real, sell everything,
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.620]   then you can come and follow me."
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.700]   Suffering is one of those Christian characteristics, one of those things of Christian life that
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.440]   we would like to conveniently ignore.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.080]   But scripture tells us clearly we must be willing to embrace it.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.160]   In other letters of Paul, in other books and parts of the Bible, it tells us that we have
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:33.720]   to go through things like endurance, refining, and perseverance, things that are not pleasant
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.980]   at the time when we go through them.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:43.560]   They are painful, but is necessary for our righteousness.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.100]   Now don't hear me wrong.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.100]   I know, okay?
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.760]   We need to look after ourselves.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.240]   Practicing self-care is an essential skill for our lives.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.360]   I'm not calling us to look, search for suffering and just go through suffering for the sake
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.240]   of it.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:05.360]   However, I do think there comes a point sometimes when self-care turns into selfishness or even
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:11.200]   self-indulgence, which means that every time something hard comes up, everything, you know,
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:17.320]   a tough road is up ahead, our natural inclination might be to avoid it.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.400]   And we start to think, "Well, surely God's not calling me to step into this direction.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.560]   That's gonna be hard.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.940]   That's gonna cost me something.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.940]   It's gonna be difficult."
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:35.480]   But church, let's not forget, we follow a Savior who was always willing to step right
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:40.620]   into the middle of suffering, who wasn't afraid of the storms.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.960]   We follow a Savior who never shrunk back from doing the difficult thing.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.640]   Therefore, as His followers, we need to learn how to embrace suffering as a way of getting
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.800]   to know Jesus better.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.640]   We need to learn to be comfortable in navigating through the difficult things in life because
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.560]   the truth is the world around us is in a constant state of groaning.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.080]   And the effects of sin in this world are still very much at play.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.480]   Therefore, learning how to go through suffering means learning how to see Jesus in the midst
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:19.520]   of pain and inviting others to do the same.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   And the key to all of this, Paul tells us, it's becoming like Him in death.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.800]   Again, it doesn't seem to make sense.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.400]   If we want to gain something, we have to die.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.720]   If we want to gain Jesus, we have to die.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.640]   How does death lead to gain?
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.320]   Well think about it this way.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.400]   What was Jesus' biggest achievement when He was here on this earth?
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.080]   What would you say that was?
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.120]   He did a lot of miracles, fed 5,000 people, walked on water, healed people, healed the
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.780]   sick, even resurrected the dead.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:03.480]   But the biggest achievement, I might put to you, that Jesus achieved on this earth was
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.840]   in fact His death.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.400]   Because Jesus dying was a shock to everyone.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.200]   Nobody expected Jesus to die.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.800]   Not even the enemy expected things would work out that way for Jesus on this earth.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.780]   But He had to die.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.400]   He had to die so that we could live.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.320]   He had to die so that sin could be defeated.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.920]   And so brothers and sisters, in the same way, in order for us to truly know Christ, we too
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.280]   have to die to the sins in our lives.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:39.400]   To be in a true relationship with Jesus is to die to the things that hold us back from
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.400]   Him.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.000]   Why is death so important?
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.440]   Because without death, there could never be resurrection.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.780]   Without dying to the sin in your life, you will never be able to experience what a changed
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.140]   life looks like.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.000]   You want to break free from the sins that were holding you back in 2023?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.560]   The only solution is to die to them.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.840]   And we do this by renouncing and repenting of our own selfish desires so that we can
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.560]   say yes to the path that Jesus wants us to walk down.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:18.140]   And unless we do, we will never know freedom.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.520]   You will never know what the new and resurrected life feels like.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.980]   You will never know what it feels like to live life and life in the full as Jesus has
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.880]   promised us.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.800]   We embrace these things.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.880]   We embrace suffering.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:39.120]   We embrace even death because we know that death does not have the final word.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:46.160]   And resurrection is a reality, a promise that is to come for those who are in Christ.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.520]   We can embrace death.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:52.000]   We don't have to be afraid because death has been defeated.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.840]   Now, if all that sounds challenging, it is.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.120]   These things are challenging because these are things we'll never be able to obtain,
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.700]   to embrace, to fully grasp in our lifetime.
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:11.360]   You see, what we've been talking about is not just goals for 2024.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.100]   These are goals for life.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.440]   This is how Paul describes it.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.480]   Not that I've already obtained all of this or have already arrived at my goal, but I
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:27.000]   press on to take hold of that which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.440]   Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it, but one thing
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:37.280]   I do, forgetting what is behind, straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:45.340]   goal to win the prize which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:52.480]   The journey to intimacy with Christ, the path of discipleship, a relationship with Jesus,
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.820]   the goal of knowing Him is going to be a lifelong pursuit.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:03.000]   It's something that we have to be willing to walk in daily, which is why Paul tells
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:10.680]   us three times, "Press on, strain toward, press on, keep going."
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.080]   And in order for us to press on in this journey, we cannot let the things of the past hold
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.560]   us back.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.880]   Forgetting what is behind, we strain towards what is ahead.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:28.280]   This is why this is a message and a challenge, like I said, hopefully for everyone.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:33.600]   Because if 2023 was the most amazing year for you, good for you, and what a blessing
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.600]   that was.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.080]   And I don't mean that in a condescending way, really.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:44.880]   But even so, even if 2023 was the most amazing thing for you, press on.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.360]   Don't sit back and bask in the glory of the past, but be reminded that there is still
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:55.140]   so much more ahead, that God can do things that you haven't even seen or imagined.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:02.560]   Be thankful for the things God has done, but keep looking forward to what is yet to come.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:10.240]   And if 2023 was a tough season for you, the encouragement is the same.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.460]   Press on.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:19.880]   And I know the pain must have been real, and the loss you suffered was unimaginable, and
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:27.740]   it cut so deep, and you don't really even know how to take the next step forward.
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:38.220]   But know this, Christ Jesus has taken a hold of you, and He will never let you go.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:43.960]   And I hope that you are walking in a community around you, a community that truly is able
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:49.300]   to walk with you through pain, so you are not alone in this.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:55.220]   And as you look ahead, as fuzzy and dark as the future seems, as painful as you might
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:03.840]   anticipate it to be, be encouraged too, to know that there's a prize that awaits you.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:09.600]   And in the great mystery of God's love and grace, I pray that you will find peace and
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.960]   healing in Jesus.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.560]   So this is the challenge for us as we walk towards 2024.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:24.240]   This is what God is calling us to, not just for this year, but for our lives as we continue
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.640]   on in this journey.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.940]   So as we end, actually, I want to open up some space for God to speak to you, right?
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.340]   This is just a message from me.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:39.040]   I'm just a person here speaking to you guys.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:43.800]   I don't know what you've been through, but God does.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:48.560]   And there's something that God wants to speak to every single person here tonight, here
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.680]   this morning, watching online, wherever we are.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.720]   So we need to open up some space for God to be able to do that.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   I have no idea, but I do know that God wants to speak to you.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.000]   So if you have something you can take notes with now, maybe it's on your phone or something
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.240]   that you write with, there's going to be some questions, reflections that we can use to
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.240]   guide our time in this.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.680]   We're going to take some time actually right now to do this, but you can also take a picture
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.560]   if you want some more time throughout the rest of the day as we look toward 2024 to
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:29.300]   do this.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:36.260]   And the team are going to play some music, but let's just open up our hearts right now
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:48.340]   and put distractions aside and ask God to speak to us.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.340]   So Lord, here we are.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:54.560]   Lord, we want to put aside some time right now.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.260]   Every single person in this room is precious to you.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:05.140]   Every single person in this room is a child of yours, whether they've realized it yet
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.940]   or not.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.180]   And you are holding out your hand.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:16.900]   That's the picture we got this morning, church, of Jesus holding out his hand, offering it
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.300]   to us.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:28.420]   Father, I pray that you would give us the strength and the courage now to take you by
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.420]   the hand.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:39.860]   Holy Spirit, I pray that you would come speak to us as we look ahead, as we strain towards
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:44.620]   the remaining time we have on this earth.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.520]   Help us to put you first.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:54.100]   Help us to know what a true and intimate relationship with you looks like.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.740]   Help us to die to the things that have held us back from you.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.220]   Walk with us through our suffering and help us to be a comfort to those around us as they
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:07.260]   are suffering.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.940]   Speak to us in this time, Lord.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:16.180]   We open up space for you to guide us and to lead us.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:44.820]   Let's just spend some time in prayer on your own, church.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.400]   (gentle music)
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.820]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.240]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.660]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:01.080]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.500]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.920]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.340]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.760]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.180]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.600]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.020]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.440]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.860]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:37.280]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:43.200]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.320]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.740]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:08.160]   (gentle music continues)
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:17.580]   (gentle music continues)
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.080]   (gentle music continues)
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:50.400]   Jesus, I thank you for speaking to us.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.040]   I thank you that as we gather together as family, Lord,
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.460]   you are in our midst.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:03.120]   The most amazing thing about you, Jesus,
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.400]   is that even as we leave,
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.560]   you continue to be with every single one of us
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.500]   and our families and the people we love
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.580]   and the things that we carry in our hearts.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:18.800]   And so Lord, for the things of 2023,
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.460]   we leave them in your hands.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.920]   And I pray comfort where comfort is needed.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.080]   I pray strength where strength is needed.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.420]   I pray thankfulness where thankfulness is needed.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.760]   I pray hope where there's been hopelessness.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:36.160]   And as we look ahead, Lord,
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.620]   as uncertain, as unknown as it might seem,
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:46.120]   I pray that you would give us the faith to know that
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.260]   if you are guiding us,
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.920]   even though if we go through difficult times,
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.260]   through difficult things, we are not abandoned.
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.460]   It may be part of your plan,
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:04.820]   but I pray that every decision we make,
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.260]   each and every day as Jethro was praying just now,
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.620]   as Justin's been praying,
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:14.960]   would be a decision to walk hand in hand with you,
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.380]   to get to know you better.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.300]   (gentle music)
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:25.440]   So Jesus, thank you that you never give up on us.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.640]   No matter what comes ahead, Lord, we trust you.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.440]   We trust you fully.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.140]   Lead us, guide us, protect us with your love.
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:41.880]   And we pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.240]   Let's respond by worshiping Jesus together, church.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.360]   You can stand or you can remain seated.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.600]   And the worship team's gonna continue to lead us
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.860]   in some songs of worship.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.860]   [MUSIC]
