1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 So on the 2nd of October, 2010, I had a dream.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,520
 And in this dream, I was rushing to a hospital

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,800
 because my friend was in the hospital.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,240
 And I rushed into the lobby of the hospital

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,520
 and I don't know where my friend is.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,920
 And you know, like in those dreams,

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,840
 sometimes you're like frantically trying to find something,

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,280
 but you can't really find it.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,940
 Is it just me that has those anxiety dreams?

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,040
 So I'm like desperately trying to find my friend

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,540
 and I'm going down different corridors in the hospital.

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,280
 I'm bursting into different rooms.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,280
 And finally I jump into this room

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,960
 and lo and behold, there's my friend.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,600
 And my friend is wearing all the hospital garb

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,440
 and she's sitting in the hospital bed.

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,020
 And I can tell that she's been crying.

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,760
 And I rush up to her in my dream and I say,

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,280
 "What's wrong? Are you okay? What happened?"

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,840
 She turns to me and she says, "I've just had a miscarriage."

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,720
 And the first thing that comes to my mind is,

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,280
 and I say to her in the dream, I say,

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,520
 "Well, how many weeks were you?"

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,700
 And she said, "40 weeks."

25
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,140
 And immediately I woke up.

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,300
 Now I'm the kind of person when I dream,

27
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,400
 I dream the most boring mundane dreams

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,520
 that you could ever dream.

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,420
 You know, like if you're a dreamer, right?

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,600
 If you dream at night,

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,300
 you wanna dream fantastic dreams, don't you?

32
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,340
 Like you wanna be able to fly or something like that,

33
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,400
 or maybe like time travel, or maybe in your dream,

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,420
 you wanna be somebody that you're not in real life, right?

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,420
 And many of our dreams, we wake up in the morning

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,700
 and we're like, "What just happened to me?"

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,860
 I don't dream like that.

38
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,720
 Like, if it doesn't happen in my real life,

39
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,140
 I will never dream it in a dream, okay?

40
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,660
 My dreams are so mundane and boring.

41
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,500
 I am more ethically conservative and a good boy in my dreams

42
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,160
 than I am in real life, okay?

43
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,780
 It's like yawn fest in my dreams.

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,140
 Anyway, this dream I recognize was different.

45
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,180
 And I woke up and I was suddenly awake,

46
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,460
 wide awake in the middle of the night,

47
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,420
 and I shook Chris beside me,

48
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,380
 and Chris sort of grudgily kind of wakes up and looks at me.

49
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,260
 I'm like, "I just had a dream, Chris."

50
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,420
 And in this dream, our friend, she was in the hospital,

51
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,460
 and I walked in and I said like, "What's wrong?"

52
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,860
 And she said she had a miscarriage.

53
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,660
 And I asked her how many weeks, and she said, "40 weeks."

54
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,380
 And like Chris turns to me and she goes,

55
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,660
 "You know what that means, don't you?

56
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,760
 You know what 40 weeks means, don't you?"

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,940
 And I'm like, "I have no idea.

58
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,580
 I'm a male, and consequently, I've never been pregnant.

59
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,860
 I have no idea what that means, right?"

60
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,180
 And she's like, "Well, that's full term."

61
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,660
 And we both looked at each other,

62
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,660
 and with tears in our eyes, we start screaming and yelling

63
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,800
 and high-fiving each other and celebrating.

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,760
 Perhaps I should explain why.

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,500
 Three months earlier, we had been finally,

66
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,640
 after quite a long process, finally approved

67
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,740
 by the government and the social welfare department

68
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,080
 for Chris and I to become adopted parents.

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,700
 We were allowed, they were saying,

70
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,840
 that we could adopt a child.

71
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,540
 Now, that had been a seven-month period

72
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,560
 by which we had filled in forms and been interviewed

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,440
 and done all this stuff to try to prove

74
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,040
 that we're really good people and nice people

75
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,180
 so that the government would allow us to enter

76
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,600
 into what's called the matching phase,

77
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,980
 where you could get matched any third Thursday

78
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,940
 to a potential child in the social welfare system.

79
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,460
 And so three months before this dream,

80
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,000
 we had been told that we were now approved,

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,900
 and we were therefore in this matching process.

82
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,960
 Now, when we found out that we were approved,

83
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
 Chris and I had a conversation together,

84
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,280
 and we said, "Here's the thing.

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,620
 When you're doing the adoption process,

86
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,080
 it's obviously very different

87
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,080
 from the normal biological process of having a child.

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,400
 And during the biological process,

89
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,880
 there's lots of things that you get used to.

90
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,660
 You've got the nine months of getting ready

91
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,360
 for the child to come and speaking to your child

92
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,800
 and putting your little head on the lap of your wife

93
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,880
 and praying over the child and all this.

94
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,840
 And in particular, when the child is finally born,

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,960
 more often than not, you're there in the room.

96
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,240
 The child takes its first breath of life.

97
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,360
 And as a Christian couple,

98
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,720
 you get the joy of blessing your child immediately

99
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,120
 in the first moments of their life, praying life over them.

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,720
 And we realized that in the adoption process,

101
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,560
 we're probably not gonna be able to have that experience.

102
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,380
 And so we said to God a bold prayer.

103
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,760
 We said, "God, if our child that we are to adopt

104
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,360
 is not yet alive,

105
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,960
 we want to know the moment the child is born.

106
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,080
 Like we want to know,

107
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,440
 because we wanna have that same experience

108
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,320
 that biological families have.

109
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,760
 We wanna know that our child has come into this world

110
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,760
 on that day so that we can start praying blessings

111
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,040
 and hope and life over our child."

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,640
 And so that was our prayer.

113
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,520
 As soon as we heard that we were approved to be matched,

114
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,500
 and then we waited for months and months,

115
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,180
 and then just a few months later,

116
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,740
 on the 2nd of October, 2010, I had the dream.

117
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,340
 And we believe that that was the moment

118
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,820
 that our child came into the world.

119
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,100
 Immediately, two things happened.

120
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,380
 The first thing was we told everybody we knew

121
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,220
 that we were about to adopt a child.

122
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,940
 The reason being is because on our form,

123
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,460
 we had written that we wanted to adopt a child

124
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,680
 under the age of six months old.

125
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,300
 And we knew because of this dream

126
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,320
 that God had brought this child into the world.

127
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,260
 So therefore, according to our form,

128
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,420
 we would receive this child

129
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,380
 at least within the next six months.

130
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,140
 It could be within the next three weeks.

131
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,540
 And so we started to tell everybody,

132
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,700
 "We're gonna have this child.

133
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,060
 This child's coming into the world.

134
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,040
 It's so exciting.

135
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,880
 We're gonna get matched."

136
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,340
 And all of our friends, our family,

137
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,420
 we said like, "Pray with us.

138
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,340
 Let's get together.

139
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,180
 Let's celebrate.

140
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,100
 Woo-hoo!"

141
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,940
 That was the first thing.

142
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,740
 The second thing was we got our room ready for this child.

143
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,380
 We had no idea whether the child was male or female.

144
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,980
 So we went for neutral colors in the room, right?

145
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,220
 We set up the whole kind of cot and everything,

146
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,440
 got the whole thing ready.

147
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,500
 We were super excited.

148
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,340
 I would pray over it every day.

149
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,540
 We had everything ready in place.

150
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,700
 All we had to do now was wait.

151
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,500
 And Christmas was just a few months away.

152
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,980
 And I remember saying to Chris one day,

153
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,040
 "Wouldn't it be awesome if we got this child for Christmas?

154
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,780
 Like it would be the best thing ever.

155
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,360
 I know children are not for Christmas.

156
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,100
 They're for life, but we wanted a child for Christmas.

157
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,660
 That was our gift."

158
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,600
 And so we started to pray for that as well.

159
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,500
 And Christmas came and went.

160
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,960
 And then six months came and went.

161
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,020
 And then seven months, nine months, 10 months.

162
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,980
 At the one year mark of having had this dream,

163
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,700
 I remember something was shifted in my spirit.

164
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,960
 And I remember thinking to myself,

165
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,560
 "Well, I guess I got that wrong.

166
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,960
 I guess that doesn't make sense.

167
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,280
 I guess I must've misinterpreted that.

168
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,040
 Like maybe I completely got that one wrong.

169
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,880
 Maybe I had a weird curry the night before

170
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,240
 and it just created this weird dream or something, right?"

171
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,200
 I remember sharing with Chris, I'm like,

172
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,480
 "Let's just let go of this thing."

173
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,360
 Because to be honest with you, holding the hope, right?

174
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,660
 For so long, that expectation

175
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,060
 that there was something that was gonna happen,

176
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,500
 that it was gonna literally happen

177
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,300
 when the phone would ring, right?

178
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,820
 Just became grating on us.

179
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,060
 We felt like God was playing a bit of a joke on us,

180
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,660
 to be honest with you.

181
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,260
 And so both together, we decided we were gonna whole shelve

182
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,580
 that whole expectation thing.

183
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,860
 The Bible says hope deferred makes the heart sick.

184
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,700
 And our hearts were sick.

185
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,820
 And so we took that dream, we took that idea,

186
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,020
 we took that reality that God had broken in

187
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,980
 and given us this idea of this birth,

188
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,180
 and we shoved it up on the shelf, if you will.

189
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,620
 We put it on hold because the reality of walking with it

190
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,220
 was just too painful.

191
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,900
 And I began to think to myself,

192
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,140
 "Well, perhaps God doesn't speak in dreams anyway."

193
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,100
 As we enter into 2022,

194
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,720
 we do so in the third year of a global pandemic

195
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,220
 that has literally turned all of our lives upside down.

196
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,820
 And if the news is anything to read

197
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,180
 in the last couple of days,

198
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,260
 the pandemic is worse now than it's ever been.

199
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,740
 That there are more cases in the UK on a single day

200
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,260
 and in the US on a single day

201
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,420
 than they've ever been over this whole pandemic time.

202
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,900
 And while the virus might be a little bit weaker

203
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,780
 in its impact, it's spreading like it's never spread before.

204
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,060
 All of us are afraid of Omicron.

205
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,420
 Hong Kong is so afraid of it

206
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,120
 that it's clamping down everything

207
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,800
 that it can possibly clamp down

208
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
 to ensure that we do not get this thing.

209
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,320
 And we wouldn't be remiss, would we be,

210
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,040
 to starting this new year with a sense of doom and gloom

211
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,680
 and that everything is just as bad as everything else.

212
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,800
 And the reality is in the midst of all of this pandemic

213
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,240
 and in the midst of having to deal

214
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,680
 with the realities of this virus and the way that we've had,

215
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,920
 we've had to put a lot of things on hold, haven't we?

216
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,960
 We've had to shove a lot of things up

217
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,160
 onto our pervertual kind of shelf, haven't we?

218
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,260
 Things of our own ideas.

219
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,780
 The reality of a virus is it doesn't just quarantine people,

220
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,540
 it also quarantines ideas.

221
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,700
 It also stops us from taking some of the things

222
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,620
 that we thought we would accomplish, some of the dreams,

223
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,460
 some of the expectations we've had,

224
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,980
 and it forces us to just kind of put those on hold

225
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,900
 whilst we're dealing with everything else,

226
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,340
 whilst we're trying to get on with all of this stuff.

227
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,620
 I just don't have the time, I just don't have the energy,

228
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,380
 I'm just gonna throw it up here on the shelf.

229
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,180
 And so projects, personal projects have gone up

230
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,340
 on the shelf for many of us.

231
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,140
 Things like stuff that we've been doing at work

232
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,460
 has had to just go on hold.

233
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,500
 Some of you entrepreneurs in this room

234
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,780
 have had to just put the pausing of fundraising

235
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,140
 or the pausing of stepping into that new idea you had,

236
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,060
 just that's had to go on the shelf for a while.

237
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,820
 For some of you, it's about relationships in this room.

238
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,460
 You've been pursuing a relationship

239
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,140
 and you just had to put that on hold

240
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,860
 whilst everything else kind of happens.

241
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,100
 And there's so much in our lives

242
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,700
 that have just been put on the shelf.

243
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,420
 And here's what I sensed as I was praying a few months ago

244
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,700
 about what was on God's heart for us as a church

245
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,380
 as we entered in 2022.

246
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,820
 Here's what I heard God say.

247
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,580
 I heard Him say this, "It's time for us to dream again."

248
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,940
 It's time for us to dream again,

249
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,540
 that the things that we've put up on the shelf,

250
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,980
 the things that God has spoken over us,

251
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,340
 spoken into us on a personal level,

252
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,620
 the dreams and the hopes and the expectations

253
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,780
 and the things that God wants to do in and through us,

254
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,780
 those moments of the words that He's spoken into us

255
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,900
 that we've thrown up there on the shelf,

256
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,220
 that we've put on hold,

257
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,700
 God is saying, "Grab a hold of them again,

258
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,580
 for it's time for us to dream again."

259
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,660
 I love this because the Bible has a lot to say

260
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,060
 about the power of joining Him in believing

261
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,020
 for His vision to come to fruition on earth.

262
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,300
 Our Bible opens up with the story of creation, doesn't it?

263
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,260
 And in Genesis 1 and 2,

264
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,180
 there's that moment where God creates humanity

265
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,820
 and God draws humanity close to Him and says these words,

266
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,540
 "Go into the world, multiply,

267
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,900
 and take essentially my vision and bring it into the world.

268
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,020
 I want you to go and flourish, steward creation.

269
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,420
 Use what you know of me

270
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,260
 and operate that out into the world around you."

271
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,860
 See, there has always been an important relationship

272
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,700
 between God's vision and our implementation.

273
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,500
 It's always been an important relationship.

274
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,740
 God has set it up that way.

275
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,580
 And guess what?

276
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,300
 He didn't need to do that.

277
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,060
 God has the ability to bring His vision on earth,

278
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,180
 whether we're involved or not.

279
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,620
 The beautiful thing of the Christian faith

280
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,060
 is that God has decided to use us,

281
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,660
 decided to bless us,

282
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,220
 decided to draw back the curtains and say,

283
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,420
 "This is my heart, this is my vision,

284
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,700
 this is my character, this is who I am.

285
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,100
 And I want you to take that and model it

286
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,420
 and be my hands and feet in the world.

287
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,580
 I will bless you so you can be a blessing.

288
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,060
 I will open up my life so that you can then do that

289
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,900
 in the world, flourish creation, steward it,

290
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,620
 and see my glory come."

291
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,620
 And when we take the things of God,

292
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,380
 His heart, His vision, His dreams in the world,

293
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,420
 and we put them on the shelf and we put them on hold,

294
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,660
 we find ourselves in a pretty dangerous place.

295
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,980
 I love the way actually Proverbs 29, verse 18

296
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,180
 puts it in the message translation.

297
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,580
 Let me read this to you.

298
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,900
 "If people can't see what God is doing,

299
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,380
 they stumble all over themselves.

300
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,860
 But when they attend to what He reveals,

301
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,540
 they are most blessed."

302
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,500
 I love the brutal honesty of this.

303
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,540
 When we cannot see what God is doing in the world,

304
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,300
 we will stumble over ourselves.

305
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,140
 In other words, God's vision has to be seen in the world

306
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,340
 in order for the world to operate as God desires it to be.

307
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,620
 When that vision is covered, when we cannot see it,

308
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,740
 we stumble over ourselves.

309
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,340
 And I tell you what, over the last couple of years,

310
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,780
 it feels like around the world,

311
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,940
 many people are stumbling over themselves.

312
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,980
 But I love what he says here.

313
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,380
 "But those who attend to what He reveals,"

314
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,740
 I love that word, attend.

315
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,420
 It means not just see, not just go like,

316
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,140
 "Oh, look, that's what God's doing,"

317
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,860
 but join Him in it, attend to it,

318
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,020
 work it in their lives, work it out through who they are.

319
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,500
 They are the one who find themselves blessed.

320
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,220
 You will never feel more alive in your life

321
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,820
 when you take the dreams that God has placed on your heart,

322
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,580
 and with courage and faith,

323
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,580
 you work those dreams out in the world.

324
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,580
 But you will also never feel more depressed, sad,

325
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,460
 doom and gloom, held back, when God speaks His word,

326
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,580
 and you do not walk in that obedience.

327
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,020
 You will find yourself stumbling over yourself,

328
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,580
 rather than the blessing that God has.

329
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,300
 Are you following this, church?

330
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,740
 So when God says to us, "It's time to dream again,"

331
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,460
 oh, He's inviting us to take some of those things

332
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,660
 that are on hold and begin to work them out for His glory,

333
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,060
 so heaven can literally come to earth.

334
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,060
 You see, being on hold might be right for a season,

335
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,900
 but it is not right for a lifestyle.

336
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,980
 Come on, church.

337
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,020
 It might be right for like a period of time,

338
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,340
 and we've had to do it.

339
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,660
 It was right for us to put some of those things on hold,

340
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,140
 whilst we learned to deal with COVID.

341
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,220
 It was important for us that we respected one another.

342
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,660
 We locked our homes down, we put on our masks,

343
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,180
 we did the things we needed to do.

344
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,380
 That was important.

345
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,660
 But we cannot put everything that God has put on our hearts,

346
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,860
 all of those dreams, all of the future,

347
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,700
 all of the things that God sees in this world,

348
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,540
 those cannot remain forever on hold.

349
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,820
 At some point, we have to rise up and say,

350
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,020
 "We are going to move God's vision forward again."

351
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,180
 Are you with me?

352
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,980
 And I feel like that's what God's inviting us into.

353
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,340
 And if you're anything like me,

354
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,500
 you're probably sitting there going, "I don't feel that way."

355
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,060
 Anyone feel that way?

356
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,020
 I don't know if that's really what's on my heart.

357
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,460
 In fact, I'm feeling kind of annoyed.

358
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,460
 I'm feeling kind of upset about everything.

359
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,140
 It's frustrating that I can't travel.

360
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,180
 It's frustrating that we can't do this.

361
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,980
 Why is the government with some of these policies

362
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,060
 that they have, like, we don't understand some of it.

363
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,500
 And it's frustrating and it's hard,

364
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,140
 and it makes us that way.

365
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,980
 Here's the thing, so much of the Christian faith

366
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,940
 is never going to be felt in you.

367
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,620
 It has to be faithed in you.

368
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,540
 Oh, I just made that up.

369
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,140
 That was really good.

370
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,220
 So much of the Christian faith is not felt in us.

371
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,540
 It's faithed in us.

372
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,980
 It's something that comes out of us,

373
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,500
 even when we don't really feel it,

374
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,020
 because we believe in God's word,

375
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,340
 we accept his promises,

376
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,220
 and we desire to walk those things out,

377
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,580
 whether we feel like it or not.

378
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,820
 Obedience is not a feeling game.

379
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,420
 Obedience is a faith game.

380
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,340
 And I wonder at the start of this year,

381
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,260
 even though we may not be feeling it,

382
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,500
 we might be at a faith something.

383
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,740
 So over the next January and February,

384
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,660
 over the next two months,

385
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,340
 we're going to lean into this idea of dreaming again.

386
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,340
 There are 21 dreams, literal dreams,

387
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,100
 that God gives somebody when they're asleep in the Bible

388
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,780
 that tells them to do something.

389
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,740
 There are 21 of them.

390
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,420
 We're going to look at seven of those

391
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,660
 over these coming weeks.

392
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,580
 And each one is designed to help you to understand

393
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,620
 how God might be speaking into you

394
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,900
 and moving in your life in this season.

395
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,700
 The schedule here behind me will show you the ways

396
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,780
 in which we are going to do that over these coming weeks.

397
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,060
 And I'm really excited with that.

398
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,100
 And I tell you, if you get these devotionals

399
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,380
 that we've already spoken about during this service,

400
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,260
 if you have those downloaded into your inbox every day

401
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,020
 from Monday the 10th onwards,

402
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,460
 I believe that will also be a blessing to you

403
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,220
 and a great partnership on a daily basis

404
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,420
 to help you think about what it might mean

405
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,900
 for you to dream again.

406
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,380
 Is this making sense to everyone?

407
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,260
 All right, here's how I want to start the series.

408
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,100
 Here's how I want to introduce it to us.

409
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,020
 I believe that there are some basic foundational principles

410
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,060
 for what God would want in us to dream again.

411
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,140
 And I want to open up some of these very basic,

412
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,300
 but very importantly, foundational ideas

413
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,820
 for you so that you can start this year with the idea,

414
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,220
 I'm gonna take some of those dreams off the shelf

415
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,900
 and I'm gonna work them out in my life.

416
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
 And to do that, I want to take us to perhaps

417
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,020
 the greatest dreamer in the Bible,

418
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,020
 the one who is certainly the greatest interpreter

419
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,020
 of dreams in the Bible, and that's Daniel.

420
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,900
 And Daniel was raised up by God to dream again

421
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,540
 at a time that was critical in Israel's history,

422
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,380
 a time when Israel desperately needed to dream again,

423
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,420
 a time when they were in exile.

424
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,340
 Babylon had come into Jerusalem,

425
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,100
 destroyed much of Jerusalem, destroyed the temple,

426
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,900
 pulled down the walls, killed many,

427
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,980
 taken a remnant of the Israelites into captivity in Babylon.

428
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,540
 One of those remnants was Daniel.

429
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,940
 And Daniel, as the scriptures say in Daniel chapter one,

430
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,900
 was invited into the court of the king of Babylon,

431
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,020
 Nebuchadnezzar.

432
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,300
 Now being invited into the court,

433
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,140
 you should read there, was a slave to the king, essentially.

434
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,100
 He didn't have a choice.

435
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,980
 He was a slave to serve the king in his court.

436
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,740
 Now, right as this is happening,

437
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,340
 the king begins to have some dreams,

438
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,340
 and these dreams are hard for him to understand.

439
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,980
 They're disturbing dreams.

440
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,620
 He doesn't fully get them,

441
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,980
 and they cause a lot of anxiety for him.

442
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,540
 And that's where we're gonna pick up the story.

443
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,620
 Are you ready for this?

444
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,220
 The first scripture that we're gonna read together

445
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,060
 in the new year.

446
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,500
 (congregation laughing)

447
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,300
 (congregation applauding)

448
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,380
 All right, here we go.

449
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,780
 (laughing)

450
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,540
 All right, here we go.

451
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,060
 Daniel chapter two, starting at verse one.

452
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,900
 In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams.

453
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,940
 His mind was troubled and he could not sleep.

454
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,980
 Who knows that when you cannot sleep, you get grumpy, amen?

455
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,540
 I wanna show you what grumpiness looks like

456
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,380
 when you can't sleep.

457
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,540
 This is really bad grumpiness.

458
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,740
 So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters,

459
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,460
 sorcerers, and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed.

460
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,300
 When they came in, they stood before the king.

461
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,420
 And he said to them, "I have had a dream that troubles me,

462
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,620
 and I want to know what it means."

463
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,100
 Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic.

464
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,700
 "Oh, king, live forever.

465
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,660
 Tell your servants the dream and we will interpret it."

466
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,340
 The king replied to the astrologers,

467
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,140
 "This is what I have firmly decided

468
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,580
 because I'm really tired right now.

469
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,540
 If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it,

470
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,580
 I will have you cut into pieces

471
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,740
 and your houses turned into piles of rubble."

472
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,740
 (laughs)

473
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,380
 "But if you tell me the dream and explain it,

474
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,900
 you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor.

475
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,220
 So tell me the dream and interpret to me."

476
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,340
 Can you believe this?

477
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,980
 He's like, "You can have cake or death.

478
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,340
 That's your choice, basically.

479
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,900
 Which one do you want?"

480
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,660
 "I'll have cake."

481
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,760
 Once more, they replied,

482
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,100
 "Let the king tell his servants the dream

483
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,900
 and we will interpret it."

484
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,740
 Then the king answered,

485
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,300
 "I am certain that you're trying to gain more time

486
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,420
 because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided.

487
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,300
 If you do not tell me the dream,

488
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,060
 there is just one penalty for you, cake or death.

489
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,180
 You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things,

490
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,940
 hoping the situation will change.

491
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,900
 So then, tell me the dream

492
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,620
 and I will know that you can interpret it for me."

493
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,580
 The astrologers answered the king this way,

494
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,020
 "There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks.

495
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,460
 No king, however great and mighty,

496
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,580
 has ever asked such a thing of any magician

497
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,220
 or enchanter or astrologer.

498
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,500
 What the king asks is too difficult.

499
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,820
 No one can reveal it to the king except the gods,

500
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,700
 and they do not live among men."

501
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,180
 Man, this is the astrologers giving up.

502
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,900
 It's like, "We cannot do this.

503
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,260
 It's impossible for us.

504
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,420
 The only thing that can do this is the gods,

505
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,780
 but they do not live on earth."

506
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,980
 This is really ironic because in chapter seven of Daniel,

507
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,580
 Daniel's gonna have a dream and he's gonna see Jesus,

508
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,180
 and he's gonna call him the son of man.

509
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,900
 God being man on earth.

510
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,620
 But at this point in Daniel,

511
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,300
 the astrologers speaking the truth.

512
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,540
 They don't know that there is any man

513
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,060
 that could ever come on earth that can be like God.

514
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,700
 And they say this, "Only the gods can answer this."

515
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,780
 And ironically, this is actually the only thing

516
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,660
 that the astrologers are saying that is true.

517
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,060
 And it's actually invitation

518
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,060
 into the first basic foundation of dreaming again.

519
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,780
 It's this, it is always a work of grace.

520
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,260
 All the dreams that we ever receive,

521
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,580
 all of the ways that we're able to interpret them,

522
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,460
 they're always a work of the grace of God.

523
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,380
 It is only God, not gods,

524
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,700
 God who holds the dreams of this world.

525
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,300
 It is only Him that gives those dreams.

526
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,580
 And it's only Him that can help us to understand

527
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,300
 those dreams through the power of His spirit at work in us.

528
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,620
 The astrologers are right.

529
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,420
 It is grace and grace alone that gives us these dreams.

530
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,500
 So when you're thinking about all those things

531
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,220
 that are on the shelf, those stuff that God has given you,

532
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,660
 the dreams and the heart that He's placed upon you,

533
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,020
 and we've shoved those up for that time on the shelf,

534
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,300
 His grace challenges us to go,

535
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,340
 these are grace gifts of God.

536
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,300
 He's given them to us out of His heart.

537
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,620
 He could do it without us.

538
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,140
 He's chosen to use us.

539
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,660
 And He's given me this gift,

540
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,940
 and He's helped me to understand what His dream is.

541
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,860
 And if I keep that on the shelf,

542
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,180
 then I'm ignoring the very grace that He's put in our lives.

543
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:34,020
 The gift of grace means that we haven't earned these dreams.

544
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,580
 We are not ones who demand these dreams.

545
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,500
 These dreams are His gift to us.

546
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,060
 And because they're His gift,

547
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,180
 how dare we keep them up on the shelf?

548
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,180
 We must grab a hold of the things that God has said to us,

549
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,620
 and in His timing and in His ability,

550
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,540
 begin to walk those out.

551
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,940
 The first foundation is recognizing

552
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,740
 it's all a work of grace.

553
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,300
 Are you with me?

554
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,140
 Here's the second one.

555
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,300
 Let's read on.

556
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,060
 Verse 12, "This made the king so angry and furious

557
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,820
 that he ordered the execution

558
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,700
 of all the wise men of Babylon.

559
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,220
 You did not choose cake.

560
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,580
 You have chosen death.

561
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,260
 I'm going to kill you.

562
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,980
 So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death.

563
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,700
 The men were sent to look for Daniel

564
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,300
 and his friends to put them to death.

565
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,620
 When Ariok, the commander of the king's guard,

566
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,660
 had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon,

567
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,260
 Daniel spoke with him in wisdom and tact.

568
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,620
 He asked the king's officer,

569
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,740
 'Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?'

570
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,460
 Ariok then explained the matter to Daniel.

571
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,420
 At this, Daniel went into the king and asked for time

572
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,540
 so that he might interpret the dream for him."

573
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,900
 I want you to see this.

574
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,380
 Daniel finds out that this king has received these dreams,

575
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,700
 that he's going to plan to kill all of the wise men,

576
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,940
 which included him and his friends as well.

577
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,660
 And Daniel's immediate response

578
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,700
 is not to run in the opposite direction.

579
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,220
 It's not to run away and try and hide.

580
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,620
 He runs towards the danger.

581
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,700
 He runs right into the court of the king.

582
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,620
 He goes right up to Nebuchadnezzar himself,

583
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,300
 and he says, "I need some time.

584
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,820
 I want to plead for you for time,"

585
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,060
 which is ironic because that's what the astrologers

586
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,900
 were doing.

587
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,340
 But here's Daniel coming directly to the king and saying,

588
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,700
 "I can, I will interpret this.

589
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,580
 It will happen, but I just need a little bit of time.

590
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,740
 Don't kill anybody.

591
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,100
 Would you work with me here?

592
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,740
 But I can do this."

593
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,100
 This is the second principle of dreaming again.

594
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,020
 Not only is this going to be a work of grace,

595
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,940
 but here's the thing.

596
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,020
 You have to have faith.

597
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,020
 You have to have faith.

598
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,660
 It took a huge amount of courage and bravery and faith

599
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,700
 for Daniel to stand in front of the king,

600
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,300
 a king who just like that

601
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,340
 could literally have him cut into pieces

602
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,460
 and pull down the rubble of his home.

603
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,620
 And he stood before this king,

604
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,660
 his life in the balance,

605
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,300
 and had the faith and the audacity to say,

606
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,220
 "I know someone who can interpret this dream.

607
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,260
 I believe there is someone."

608
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,220
 Some of you in this room,

609
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,620
 in order for you to take those things

610
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,420
 that are on the shelf in your life right now

611
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,140
 and begin to work them out in your life in 2022,

612
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,660
 it's gonna take an incredible amount of bravery.

613
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,940
 It's gonna take a lot of bravery and courage and faith

614
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,340
 for you to do that.

615
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,540
 And that's not a small thing.

616
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,860
 I want you to realize this.

617
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,100
 God doesn't give a dream that doesn't require faith.

618
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,660
 God will never give you a dream that is easy

619
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,300
 and you don't need to do anything.

620
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,580
 God will always give you a dream

621
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,660
 where it'll require a stretching of your abilities,

622
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,380
 a stretching of your faith,

623
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,460
 because he's calling you to partnership with him.

624
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,940
 He's not calling you to watch what he does.

625
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,060
 He's calling you to partnership with him.

626
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,420
 He'll give you that dream.

627
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,900
 He'll help you to interpret it.

628
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,060
 He'll walk with you,

629
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,740
 but you'll need to have that faith.

630
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,900
 You see, in the relationship dynamic with God,

631
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,340
 God's position is to give the gift and grace.

632
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,100
 Our position is to implement it in faith.

633
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,220
 Are you with me?

634
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,260
 So it's always gonna require faith.

635
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,140
 And some of us, that's the prayer at the start of 2022.

636
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,340
 I need the faith, Lord, to take this thing off the shelf

637
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,780
 'cause it's comfortable to leave it on the shelf.

638
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,900
 Remember I said in my own dream experience,

639
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,260
 hope deferred makes the heart sick.

640
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,460
 It was easier for me to keep it on the shelf,

641
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,260
 but it would take faith for me

642
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,020
 to believe in that dream again.

643
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,020
 It'll take some faith for some of you

644
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,820
 to take that dream off the shelf.

645
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,660
 Is this helping someone?

646
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,740
 All right, let's carry on.

647
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,300
 Verse 17.

648
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,820
 Then Daniel returned to his house

649
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,540
 and explained the matter to his friends,

650
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,620
 Hananiah, and Mishael, and Nazareth.

651
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,980
 He urged them to plead to mercy from God of heaven,

652
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,500
 proclaiming and concerning this mystery

653
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,100
 so that he and his friends might not be executed

654
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,020
 with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

655
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,740
 The very first thing that Daniel does

656
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,220
 after he's gone before the king

657
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,260
 and he's realized this is all a grace work,

658
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,100
 I'm gonna have faith before the king.

659
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,500
 The very first thing he does is he turns around,

660
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,540
 he goes back to his friends, and he says, I need your help.

661
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,700
 Come on, guys, come on, friends, get around me.

662
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,860
 We need to pray together.

663
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,500
 We need to pray and plead for mercy from God,

664
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,740
 because if we don't get that mercy, we're gonna die.

665
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,580
 So there's an importance here.

666
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,420
 Let's get together as brothers,

667
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,140
 and we're gonna pray and believe

668
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,140
 that God's gonna give us this interpretation of this dream.

669
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,060
 We haven't even got a clue what the dream is,

670
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,220
 but we're gonna pray and ask God in faith together.

671
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,380
 Would you join me, is what he says to his friends.

672
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,460
 This is the third foundation of dreaming again.

673
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,020
 You have to involve your community.

674
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,020
 You got to involve the people around you

675
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,820
 in the dreams that God has given you in your life,

676
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,780
 'cause they're not just for you.

677
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,780
 The dreams are there to inspire the people

678
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,540
 who are walking around you.

679
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,140
 The dreams are there to be shared,

680
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,020
 because the burden is always going to be too much for you

681
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,680
 on your shoulders alone.

682
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,360
 You've gotta have a group of people around you

683
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,820
 that are cheering you on, that are discerning with you,

684
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,220
 that are listening to you.

685
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,340
 Hear this, out of all of my pastoral time,

686
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,860
 my pastoral life, I've always noticed this,

687
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,340
 that the most dangerous people in the church

688
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,340
 are those that dream in isolation.

689
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,580
 It's a big thing to say.

690
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,100
 The most dangerous people in church

691
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,620
 are the ones who dream in isolation.

692
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,820
 In other words, the ones who believe

693
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,780
 that they and they alone hear the word of God.

694
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,420
 The ones who believe that they and they alone

695
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,380
 are the ones that understand God's word and interpret it,

696
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,060
 and have no humility to say,

697
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,860
 I might have not got that right,

698
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,100
 and I wonder whether my trusted friends,

699
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,660
 whether that's in my community group,

700
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,100
 whether that's in my prayer group,

701
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,660
 whether that's in my friends and family,

702
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,500
 I can share this,

703
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,780
 because I wanna hold God's word seriously,

704
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,660
 but I have humility in that word,

705
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,620
 and I know that I don't always hear it right,

706
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,780
 I don't always get it right,

707
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,020
 but in community with others, we can discern together,

708
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,740
 and I can walk with more confidence into the future

709
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,260
 with that faith, because together we have heard.

710
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,380
 Are you with me?

711
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,860
 So some of you, your big investment in 2022

712
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,300
 needs to be in a community,

713
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,220
 because if you're gonna take that stuff off the shelf,

714
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,940
 you better have some people you can share it with,

715
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,260
 who can stand next to you and cheer you on,

716
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,340
 and walk with you every step of the way.

717
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,820
 Let's keep going.

718
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,580
 Verse 19, "During the night,

719
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,060
 the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision.

720
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,620
 Then Daniel praised the God of heaven and said this,

721
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,500
 'Praise be to the name of God forever and ever.

722
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,340
 Wisdom and power are his.

723
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,380
 He changes times and seasons.

724
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,260
 He sets up kings and he disposes them.

725
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,980
 He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.

726
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,260
 He reveals deep and hidden things.

727
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,500
 He knows what lies in darkness and the light dwells in him.

728
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,380
 Oh, I thank you and I praise you, O God of my fathers,

729
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,420
 for you have given me wisdom and power.

730
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,900
 You have made known to me what is asked of you.

731
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,540
 You have made known to us the dream of the king.'"

732
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,020
 Notice this, the very first thing that he does here

733
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,060
 is he responds in worship.

734
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,860
 As soon as he has that dream,

735
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,940
 as soon as he understands what it is,

736
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,180
 he responds in worship.

737
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,140
 He doesn't immediately rush into the king,

738
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,780
 which is probably what I would have done

739
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,860
 'cause I've got the answer and I don't wanna die.

740
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,860
 I would have probably rushed straight into the king

741
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,060
 and said, "I've got the answer.

742
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,800
 Here it is, please don't kill me."

743
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,300
 The very first thing Daniel does,

744
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,260
 even though it creates more of a delay, is he worships.

745
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,180
 He says, "I need to go before the source.

746
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,020
 Let's give me this thing."

747
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,780
 And notice the words he uses.

748
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,060
 He says to God, "You have wisdom.

749
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,500
 You have power.

750
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,180
 You're the one who knows and reveals deep and hidden things."

751
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,380
 He gives all of the power to God,

752
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,300
 but then he says later in the praise, he says,

753
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,140
 "But you have given me wisdom and power.

754
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,060
 I am now able to discern

755
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,620
 and make known the dream to the king."

756
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,660
 In other words, do you see the partnership?

757
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,820
 God's vision, our implementation.

758
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,460
 God has the power and the wisdom.

759
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,540
 I've been given that by a grace gift of God.

760
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,900
 I'm gonna, first of all, before I do anything else,

761
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,180
 recognize where that gift has come from.

762
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,580
 When we don't worship for the dreams that we're given,

763
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,340
 we come to think that the dreams are ours and not God's.

764
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,020
 Our ability to worship in response to the dreams

765
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,580
 that we are given is our ability to remain humble

766
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,540
 and our ability to remain that this is God's dream, not mine.

767
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,100
 He's the one with wisdom and power.

768
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,460
 He's the one who can reveal all the mysteries.

769
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,100
 And I'm just so graced that he has enabled me to do that

770
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,960
 in this particular time with this king.

771
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,800
 Are you with me?

772
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,980
 Your worship will keep you humble.

773
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,380
 Your worship will keep the dream God's and not yours.

774
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,020
 Finally, verse 24.

775
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,780
 "Then Daniel went to Ariok, whom the king had appointed

776
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,420
 to execute the wise men of Babylon and said to him this,

777
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,660
 'Do not execute the wise men of Babylon.

778
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,740
 Take me to the king

779
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,180
 and I will interpret his dream for him.'

780
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,340
 Ariok took Daniel to the king at once and said,

781
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,900
 'I found a man among the exiles from Judah

782
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,380
 who can tell the king what the dream means.'

783
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,840
 So the king asked Daniel, also called Balaal-Savar,

784
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,240
 'Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream

785
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,760
 and interpret it?'

786
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,380
 Daniel replied, 'No wise man, enchanter, magician,

787
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,000
 or diviner can explain to the king the mystery

788
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,480
 of what he's just asked about.

789
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,480
 But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries.'"

790
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,040
 I love this.

791
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,160
 The thing he does is he stands before Nebuchadnezzar

792
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
 and he testifies the gospel.

793
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,620
 He says, "I can't do it.

794
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,300
 None of your astrologers can do it.

795
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,180
 No magician can do it, but don't be fooled.

796
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,180
 There is a God who reveals mysteries."

797
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,540
 See, I love this idea.

798
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,260
 See, this is the final foundation of dreaming again.

799
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:22,020
 It is this, that we have to truly know who our God is.

800
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,940
 Like really know who he is.

801
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,340
 'Cause when you know who your God is,

802
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,380
 you will take those dreams off the shelf.

803
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,740
 You won't second guess them.

804
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,980
 You won't diminish them.

805
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,740
 You will say, "I know who my God is.

806
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,180
 I know he has this character.

807
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,400
 I know he has this heart.

808
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,040
 I know he wants to do this in the world.

809
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,840
 I know he's at work in these areas.

810
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,100
 I'm gonna take those things off

811
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,160
 because this is in line with the character of God.

812
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,600
 I know God, this dream is of him.

813
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,320
 And I'm gonna work that dream out in my life."

814
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,760
 He stands before the king who has his life in his hands.

815
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,880
 And he says, "I can't do it, but God can.

816
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,680
 There is a God who reveals mysteries."

817
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,320
 I wanna encourage you as you're stepping into 2022,

818
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,780
 may that be your testimony from your mouth.

819
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,640
 Yes, this is gonna be a hard year ahead.

820
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,340
 I'm not sugar-coating anything.

821
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,140
 We know that there's an ongoing journey with this virus.

822
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,820
 And who knows when Hong Kong might have that virus

823
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,180
 and it might have an impact on our lives once again.

824
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,540
 The reality is this, we cannot start this year

825
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,180
 with a doom and gloom mentality.

826
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,220
 We cannot start this year thinking that the things

827
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,220
 just need to remain on the shelf.

828
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,380
 God has given you dreams.

829
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,220
 He's spoken his word over you.

830
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,280
 And he's done it not just for your benefit.

831
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,140
 He's done it because that's the way the world works.

832
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,700
 He wants you to go into the world,

833
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,600
 bringing his heart and his vision to the world around you.

834
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,340
 That's the way the world flourishes.

835
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:46,640
 If we don't do that, people will stumble over themselves.

836
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,340
 But those who attend to the revealed things of God

837
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,240
 are the ones who understand his blessing.

838
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,240
 The church in 2022 must rise up here in Hong Kong,

839
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,960
 perhaps more than anywhere.

840
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,680
 Take these foundations of dreaming again and walk that out.

841
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,200
 Because we do, my friends, have a God who reveals mysteries,

842
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,280
 who reveals the things that we could not know

843
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,000
 unless God told us so.

844
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,360
 All of which brings me back to that dream I received

845
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,360
 on the 2nd of October, 2010.

846
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,800
 Two years after that dream,

847
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,640
 a full year after I shoved it on the shelf and ignored it,

848
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,580
 I get a phone call.

849
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,760
 And the phone call is from our social worker.

850
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,400
 And it's the phone call that we've been waiting for.

851
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,480
 And in an excited tone, our social worker,

852
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,880
 who knows that we've gone through a long, hard journey,

853
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,120
 says, "Oh, you'll never believe it.

854
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,760
 Today, you guys were matched to a baby girl."

855
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,200
 And she starts to tell us all about this baby girl.

856
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,280
 And I'm there on the phone with her for 20 minutes.

857
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,400
 And she's telling us every minute detail

858
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,280
 that they ever knew or know about this girl,

859
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,400
 about her background, about her family, all of this stuff.

860
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,080
 And the last thing that she tells me,

861
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,360
 the things that she didn't tell me, is when she was born.

862
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,920
 And so I'm there for like 20 minutes

863
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,680
 with my heart racing really fast, right?

864
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,040
 And I'm like, "What is going on?"

865
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,680
 And so after about 20 minutes, my patience wore out.

866
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,000
 I break into the conversation.

867
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 I said, "Was this child born on the 2nd of October, 2010?"

868
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,040
 And her stunned silence told me

869
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,440
 everything I needed to know.

870
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,600
 Mia was born that very day I had the dream.

871
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,880
 And there are some amazing stories

872
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,280
 as to why it took two years,

873
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,160
 which I don't have time to tell you today.

874
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,080
 But God held her for us and us for her.

875
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,920
 And he told us on that day,

876
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,280
 'cause he's a God who reveals mysteries.

877
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,920
 And we knew from that moment

878
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,960
 that our child had come into the world.

879
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,160
 Ah, God is awesome.

880
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,440
 And those things that you've got up on the shelf,

881
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,720
 those individual dreams that God has given you,

882
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,800
 hear his voice over you.

883
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,080
 It's time to dream again.

884
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,160
 Those dreams are a grace gift from him.

885
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,900
 They're gonna require faith in you.

886
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,720
 They're to be shared with the people around you

887
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,600
 so you can walk in community with them.

888
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,720
 They are always to be responded to in worship.

889
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,440
 And when you know your God,

890
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,360
 then you walk in those dreams with confidence, assurance,

891
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,240
 knowing that his will will be known on earth

892
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,640
 as it is in heaven.

893
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,540
 Church, let's rise up for it's time to dream again.

894
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,400
 Could you stand with me?

895
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,500
 I wanna pray over you.

896
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:36,360
 And if you're comfortable, I wanna invite you,

897
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,460
 whether you're online right now or in this room,

898
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,620
 just open your hands with me, I wanna pray.

899
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,800
 Father, we are here gathered at the start of 2022.

900
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,440
 And like Daniel, Father,

901
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,840
 we find ourselves now standing before you with that heart,

902
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,960
 that you are a God who reveals mysteries.

903
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,640
 And Lord, there's a lot of mysteries in the world right now.

904
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,000
 And Lord, represented in this room and online

905
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,200
 are many individuals that are carrying mysteries

906
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,100
 and questions.

907
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,960
 When will I see my family again?

908
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,080
 When will this virus be under control?

909
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,180
 When can I travel?

910
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,240
 When can I start that job that I was hoping to start?

911
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,720
 When can that project really kick off?

912
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,620
 Lord, in this room, we have many mysteries

913
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,160
 that seem to go unsolved in a time like this.

914
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,480
 And I wonder whether you would just start 2022

915
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,400
 by perhaps bringing some of those questions before the Lord.

916
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,160
 He's big enough, gracious enough, wonderful enough

917
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,360
 to hear them from us.

918
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,040
 Those frustrations we have, the questions and the mysteries

919
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,660
 that seem to go unanswered.

920
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,060
 And I wanna challenge you to pray some bold prayers

921
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,200
 at the beginning of this year.

922
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,120
 Like Chris and I who prayed to God and said,

923
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,820
 "Father, we wanna wake up the day that child is born."

924
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,360
 I wonder what bold prayers the Holy Spirit

925
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,200
 might be placing in your heart today.

926
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,400
 And for some of you, you've been praying those prayers,

927
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,160
 but you've shoved them up on the shelf.

928
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,560
 Perhaps like me, hope deferred has made your heart

929
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,380
 a bit sick.

930
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,440
 Perhaps like me, it's too painful

931
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,800
 and you've thrown it up on the shelf

932
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,720
 and gotten on with your life.

933
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,780
 I feel the Holy Spirit would come today

934
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,940
 and just gently guide you into a place

935
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,420
 of taking those dreams again and perhaps tentatively,

936
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,540
 but step-by-step walking into a place of believing

937
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,720
 and hoping once more.

938
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,200
 Father, for dreams in this room

939
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,780
 that have seemed a long way off,

940
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,220
 would you come Holy Spirit?

941
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,520
 Father, would you give us the faith we need?

942
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,280
 Lord, we know that when you give dreams,

943
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,740
 it always requires some faith.

944
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,760
 Father, would you give us the boldness we see in Daniel,

945
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,700
 the courage Lord, to stand before our city,

946
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,180
 to stand before whatever it is

947
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,020
 that might be the obstacle in our path

948
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,380
 and proclaim dreams again, your dreams, your heart.

949
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:06,580
 Father, we are so grateful for community.

950
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,620
 And Lord, I wanna pray for some people in this room

951
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,860
 that feel isolated right now.

952
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,820
 Lord, I wanna ask for the right men and women

953
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,580
 to come alongside of them this year.

954
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,120
 I pray 2022 would be the birthing of new community

955
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,340
 for many people here.

956
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,420
 Lord, you do not want us to dream in isolation, Lord.

957
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,740
 So I pray for the right men, the right women,

958
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,500
 the right resources to come alongside

959
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,460
 of the people in this room

960
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,700
 that are holding dreams in their heart.

961
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,740
 And I wanna challenge you, if you're isolating yourself,

962
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,600
 would you hear the wind of the Spirit on you today

963
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,000
 to step out of your isolation towards community?

964
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,320
 Father, we worship you.

965
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,680
 We worship you with everything we have.

966
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,820
 Lord, so that we can keep those dreams yours and not ours.

967
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,060
 And Father, we take whatever it is

968
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,400
 that we're thinking right now and we place it before you.

969
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,380
 You are a God of all power and all wisdom.

970
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,080
 Lord, we trust your timing.

971
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,080
 As hard as it was for Chris and I to wait those two years,

972
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,940
 Mia came into our lives at the exact right time.

973
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,780
 And Lord, I believe that will be the same

974
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,860
 for whatever promises are coming

975
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,500
 for the people in this room.

976
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,180
 Lord, would you give us steadfastness in the waiting?

977
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,180
 Would you give us hope in the waiting, Lord God?

978
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,760
 Would you give us courage?

979
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,060
 Father, we wanna dream again.

980
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,000
 And I pray you would reveal your character

981
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,280
 and your goodness to us.

982
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,060
 I pray that like Daniel, we'd be able to stand

983
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,080
 before all of the kings of this world

984
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,320
 and say there is a God who knows of mysteries.

985
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,080
 Now that would be the testimony of our faith

986
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,700
 to bring you glory on earth as it is in heaven.

987
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,300
 Lord, help us to dream.

988
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,720
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

989
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
 Everyone says.

990
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,560
 - Amen. - Amen.

991
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,460
 Let's respond together in worship.

992
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,040
 (gentle music)
