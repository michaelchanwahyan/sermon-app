[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   So on the 2nd of October, 2010, I had a dream.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   And in this dream, I was rushing to a hospital
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.800]   because my friend was in the hospital.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.240]   And I rushed into the lobby of the hospital
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.520]   and I don't know where my friend is.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.920]   And you know, like in those dreams,
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.840]   sometimes you're like frantically trying to find something,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.280]   but you can't really find it.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.940]   Is it just me that has those anxiety dreams?
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.040]   So I'm like desperately trying to find my friend
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.540]   and I'm going down different corridors in the hospital.
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.280]   I'm bursting into different rooms.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.280]   And finally I jump into this room
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.960]   and lo and behold, there's my friend.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.600]   And my friend is wearing all the hospital garb
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.440]   and she's sitting in the hospital bed.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.020]   And I can tell that she's been crying.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.760]   And I rush up to her in my dream and I say,
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.280]   "What's wrong? Are you okay? What happened?"
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.840]   She turns to me and she says, "I've just had a miscarriage."
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.720]   And the first thing that comes to my mind is,
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.280]   and I say to her in the dream, I say,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.520]   "Well, how many weeks were you?"
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.700]   And she said, "40 weeks."
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.140]   And immediately I woke up.
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.300]   Now I'm the kind of person when I dream,
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.400]   I dream the most boring mundane dreams
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.520]   that you could ever dream.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.420]   You know, like if you're a dreamer, right?
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.600]   If you dream at night,
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.300]   you wanna dream fantastic dreams, don't you?
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.340]   Like you wanna be able to fly or something like that,
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.400]   or maybe like time travel, or maybe in your dream,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.420]   you wanna be somebody that you're not in real life, right?
[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.420]   And many of our dreams, we wake up in the morning
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.700]   and we're like, "What just happened to me?"
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.860]   I don't dream like that.
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.720]   Like, if it doesn't happen in my real life,
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.140]   I will never dream it in a dream, okay?
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.660]   My dreams are so mundane and boring.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.500]   I am more ethically conservative and a good boy in my dreams
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.160]   than I am in real life, okay?
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.780]   It's like yawn fest in my dreams.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.140]   Anyway, this dream I recognize was different.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.180]   And I woke up and I was suddenly awake,
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.460]   wide awake in the middle of the night,
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.420]   and I shook Chris beside me,
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.380]   and Chris sort of grudgily kind of wakes up and looks at me.
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.260]   I'm like, "I just had a dream, Chris."
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.420]   And in this dream, our friend, she was in the hospital,
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.460]   and I walked in and I said like, "What's wrong?"
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.860]   And she said she had a miscarriage.
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.660]   And I asked her how many weeks, and she said, "40 weeks."
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.380]   And like Chris turns to me and she goes,
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.660]   "You know what that means, don't you?
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.760]   You know what 40 weeks means, don't you?"
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.940]   And I'm like, "I have no idea.
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.580]   I'm a male, and consequently, I've never been pregnant.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.860]   I have no idea what that means, right?"
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.180]   And she's like, "Well, that's full term."
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.660]   And we both looked at each other,
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.660]   and with tears in our eyes, we start screaming and yelling
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.800]   and high-fiving each other and celebrating.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.760]   Perhaps I should explain why.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.500]   Three months earlier, we had been finally,
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.640]   after quite a long process, finally approved
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.740]   by the government and the social welfare department
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.080]   for Chris and I to become adopted parents.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.700]   We were allowed, they were saying,
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.840]   that we could adopt a child.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.540]   Now, that had been a seven-month period
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.560]   by which we had filled in forms and been interviewed
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.440]   and done all this stuff to try to prove
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.040]   that we're really good people and nice people
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.180]   so that the government would allow us to enter
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.600]   into what's called the matching phase,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.980]   where you could get matched any third Thursday
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.940]   to a potential child in the social welfare system.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.460]   And so three months before this dream,
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.000]   we had been told that we were now approved,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.900]   and we were therefore in this matching process.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.960]   Now, when we found out that we were approved,
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   Chris and I had a conversation together,
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.280]   and we said, "Here's the thing.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.620]   When you're doing the adoption process,
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.080]   it's obviously very different
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.080]   from the normal biological process of having a child.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.400]   And during the biological process,
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.880]   there's lots of things that you get used to.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.660]   You've got the nine months of getting ready
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.360]   for the child to come and speaking to your child
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.800]   and putting your little head on the lap of your wife
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.880]   and praying over the child and all this.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.840]   And in particular, when the child is finally born,
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.960]   more often than not, you're there in the room.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.240]   The child takes its first breath of life.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.360]   And as a Christian couple,
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.720]   you get the joy of blessing your child immediately
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.120]   in the first moments of their life, praying life over them.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.720]   And we realized that in the adoption process,
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.560]   we're probably not gonna be able to have that experience.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.380]   And so we said to God a bold prayer.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.760]   We said, "God, if our child that we are to adopt
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.360]   is not yet alive,
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.960]   we want to know the moment the child is born.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.080]   Like we want to know,
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.440]   because we wanna have that same experience
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.320]   that biological families have.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.760]   We wanna know that our child has come into this world
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.760]   on that day so that we can start praying blessings
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.040]   and hope and life over our child."
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.640]   And so that was our prayer.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.520]   As soon as we heard that we were approved to be matched,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.500]   and then we waited for months and months,
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.180]   and then just a few months later,
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.740]   on the 2nd of October, 2010, I had the dream.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.340]   And we believe that that was the moment
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.820]   that our child came into the world.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.100]   Immediately, two things happened.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.380]   The first thing was we told everybody we knew
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.220]   that we were about to adopt a child.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.940]   The reason being is because on our form,
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.460]   we had written that we wanted to adopt a child
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.680]   under the age of six months old.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.300]   And we knew because of this dream
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.320]   that God had brought this child into the world.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.260]   So therefore, according to our form,
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.420]   we would receive this child
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.380]   at least within the next six months.
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.140]   It could be within the next three weeks.
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.540]   And so we started to tell everybody,
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.700]   "We're gonna have this child.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.060]   This child's coming into the world.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.040]   It's so exciting.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.880]   We're gonna get matched."
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.340]   And all of our friends, our family,
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.420]   we said like, "Pray with us.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.340]   Let's get together.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.180]   Let's celebrate.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.100]   Woo-hoo!"
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.940]   That was the first thing.
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.740]   The second thing was we got our room ready for this child.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.380]   We had no idea whether the child was male or female.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.980]   So we went for neutral colors in the room, right?
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.220]   We set up the whole kind of cot and everything,
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.440]   got the whole thing ready.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.500]   We were super excited.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.340]   I would pray over it every day.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.540]   We had everything ready in place.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.700]   All we had to do now was wait.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.500]   And Christmas was just a few months away.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.980]   And I remember saying to Chris one day,
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.040]   "Wouldn't it be awesome if we got this child for Christmas?
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.780]   Like it would be the best thing ever.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.360]   I know children are not for Christmas.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.100]   They're for life, but we wanted a child for Christmas.
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.660]   That was our gift."
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.600]   And so we started to pray for that as well.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.500]   And Christmas came and went.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.960]   And then six months came and went.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.020]   And then seven months, nine months, 10 months.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.980]   At the one year mark of having had this dream,
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.700]   I remember something was shifted in my spirit.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.960]   And I remember thinking to myself,
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.560]   "Well, I guess I got that wrong.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.960]   I guess that doesn't make sense.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.280]   I guess I must've misinterpreted that.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.040]   Like maybe I completely got that one wrong.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.880]   Maybe I had a weird curry the night before
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.240]   and it just created this weird dream or something, right?"
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.200]   I remember sharing with Chris, I'm like,
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.480]   "Let's just let go of this thing."
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.360]   Because to be honest with you, holding the hope, right?
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.660]   For so long, that expectation
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.060]   that there was something that was gonna happen,
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.500]   that it was gonna literally happen
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.300]   when the phone would ring, right?
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.820]   Just became grating on us.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.060]   We felt like God was playing a bit of a joke on us,
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.660]   to be honest with you.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.260]   And so both together, we decided we were gonna whole shelve
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.580]   that whole expectation thing.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.860]   The Bible says hope deferred makes the heart sick.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.700]   And our hearts were sick.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.820]   And so we took that dream, we took that idea,
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.020]   we took that reality that God had broken in
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.980]   and given us this idea of this birth,
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.180]   and we shoved it up on the shelf, if you will.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.620]   We put it on hold because the reality of walking with it
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.220]   was just too painful.
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.900]   And I began to think to myself,
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.140]   "Well, perhaps God doesn't speak in dreams anyway."
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:03.100]   As we enter into 2022,
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.720]   we do so in the third year of a global pandemic
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.220]   that has literally turned all of our lives upside down.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.820]   And if the news is anything to read
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.180]   in the last couple of days,
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.260]   the pandemic is worse now than it's ever been.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.740]   That there are more cases in the UK on a single day
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.260]   and in the US on a single day
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.420]   than they've ever been over this whole pandemic time.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.900]   And while the virus might be a little bit weaker
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.780]   in its impact, it's spreading like it's never spread before.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.060]   All of us are afraid of Omicron.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.420]   Hong Kong is so afraid of it
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.120]   that it's clamping down everything
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.800]   that it can possibly clamp down
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   to ensure that we do not get this thing.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.320]   And we wouldn't be remiss, would we be,
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.040]   to starting this new year with a sense of doom and gloom
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.680]   and that everything is just as bad as everything else.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.800]   And the reality is in the midst of all of this pandemic
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.240]   and in the midst of having to deal
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.680]   with the realities of this virus and the way that we've had,
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.920]   we've had to put a lot of things on hold, haven't we?
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.960]   We've had to shove a lot of things up
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.160]   onto our pervertual kind of shelf, haven't we?
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.260]   Things of our own ideas.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.780]   The reality of a virus is it doesn't just quarantine people,
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.540]   it also quarantines ideas.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.700]   It also stops us from taking some of the things
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.620]   that we thought we would accomplish, some of the dreams,
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.460]   some of the expectations we've had,
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.980]   and it forces us to just kind of put those on hold
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.900]   whilst we're dealing with everything else,
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.340]   whilst we're trying to get on with all of this stuff.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.620]   I just don't have the time, I just don't have the energy,
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.380]   I'm just gonna throw it up here on the shelf.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.180]   And so projects, personal projects have gone up
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.340]   on the shelf for many of us.
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.140]   Things like stuff that we've been doing at work
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.460]   has had to just go on hold.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.500]   Some of you entrepreneurs in this room
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.780]   have had to just put the pausing of fundraising
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.140]   or the pausing of stepping into that new idea you had,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.060]   just that's had to go on the shelf for a while.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.820]   For some of you, it's about relationships in this room.
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.460]   You've been pursuing a relationship
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.140]   and you just had to put that on hold
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.860]   whilst everything else kind of happens.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.100]   And there's so much in our lives
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.700]   that have just been put on the shelf.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.420]   And here's what I sensed as I was praying a few months ago
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.700]   about what was on God's heart for us as a church
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.380]   as we entered in 2022.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.820]   Here's what I heard God say.
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.580]   I heard Him say this, "It's time for us to dream again."
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.940]   It's time for us to dream again,
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.540]   that the things that we've put up on the shelf,
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.980]   the things that God has spoken over us,
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.340]   spoken into us on a personal level,
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.620]   the dreams and the hopes and the expectations
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.780]   and the things that God wants to do in and through us,
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.780]   those moments of the words that He's spoken into us
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.900]   that we've thrown up there on the shelf,
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.220]   that we've put on hold,
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.700]   God is saying, "Grab a hold of them again,
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.580]   for it's time for us to dream again."
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.660]   I love this because the Bible has a lot to say
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.060]   about the power of joining Him in believing
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.020]   for His vision to come to fruition on earth.
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.300]   Our Bible opens up with the story of creation, doesn't it?
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.260]   And in Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.180]   there's that moment where God creates humanity
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.820]   and God draws humanity close to Him and says these words,
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.540]   "Go into the world, multiply,
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.900]   and take essentially my vision and bring it into the world.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.020]   I want you to go and flourish, steward creation.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.420]   Use what you know of me
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.260]   and operate that out into the world around you."
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.860]   See, there has always been an important relationship
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.700]   between God's vision and our implementation.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.500]   It's always been an important relationship.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.740]   God has set it up that way.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.580]   And guess what?
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.300]   He didn't need to do that.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.060]   God has the ability to bring His vision on earth,
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.180]   whether we're involved or not.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.620]   The beautiful thing of the Christian faith
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.060]   is that God has decided to use us,
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.660]   decided to bless us,
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.220]   decided to draw back the curtains and say,
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.420]   "This is my heart, this is my vision,
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.700]   this is my character, this is who I am.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.100]   And I want you to take that and model it
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.420]   and be my hands and feet in the world.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.580]   I will bless you so you can be a blessing.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.060]   I will open up my life so that you can then do that
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.900]   in the world, flourish creation, steward it,
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.620]   and see my glory come."
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.620]   And when we take the things of God,
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.380]   His heart, His vision, His dreams in the world,
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.420]   and we put them on the shelf and we put them on hold,
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.660]   we find ourselves in a pretty dangerous place.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.980]   I love the way actually Proverbs 29, verse 18
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.180]   puts it in the message translation.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.580]   Let me read this to you.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.900]   "If people can't see what God is doing,
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.380]   they stumble all over themselves.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.860]   But when they attend to what He reveals,
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.540]   they are most blessed."
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.500]   I love the brutal honesty of this.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.540]   When we cannot see what God is doing in the world,
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.300]   we will stumble over ourselves.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.140]   In other words, God's vision has to be seen in the world
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.340]   in order for the world to operate as God desires it to be.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.620]   When that vision is covered, when we cannot see it,
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.740]   we stumble over ourselves.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.340]   And I tell you what, over the last couple of years,
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.780]   it feels like around the world,
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.940]   many people are stumbling over themselves.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.980]   But I love what he says here.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.380]   "But those who attend to what He reveals,"
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.740]   I love that word, attend.
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.420]   It means not just see, not just go like,
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.140]   "Oh, look, that's what God's doing,"
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.860]   but join Him in it, attend to it,
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.020]   work it in their lives, work it out through who they are.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.500]   They are the one who find themselves blessed.
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.220]   You will never feel more alive in your life
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.820]   when you take the dreams that God has placed on your heart,
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.580]   and with courage and faith,
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.580]   you work those dreams out in the world.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:46.580]   But you will also never feel more depressed, sad,
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.460]   doom and gloom, held back, when God speaks His word,
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.580]   and you do not walk in that obedience.
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.020]   You will find yourself stumbling over yourself,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.580]   rather than the blessing that God has.
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.300]   Are you following this, church?
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.740]   So when God says to us, "It's time to dream again,"
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.460]   oh, He's inviting us to take some of those things
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.660]   that are on hold and begin to work them out for His glory,
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.060]   so heaven can literally come to earth.
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:21.060]   You see, being on hold might be right for a season,
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.900]   but it is not right for a lifestyle.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.980]   Come on, church.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.020]   It might be right for like a period of time,
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.340]   and we've had to do it.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.660]   It was right for us to put some of those things on hold,
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.140]   whilst we learned to deal with COVID.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.220]   It was important for us that we respected one another.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.660]   We locked our homes down, we put on our masks,
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.180]   we did the things we needed to do.
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.380]   That was important.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.660]   But we cannot put everything that God has put on our hearts,
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.860]   all of those dreams, all of the future,
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.700]   all of the things that God sees in this world,
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.540]   those cannot remain forever on hold.
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.820]   At some point, we have to rise up and say,
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.020]   "We are going to move God's vision forward again."
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.180]   Are you with me?
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.980]   And I feel like that's what God's inviting us into.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.340]   And if you're anything like me,
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.500]   you're probably sitting there going, "I don't feel that way."
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.060]   Anyone feel that way?
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.020]   I don't know if that's really what's on my heart.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.460]   In fact, I'm feeling kind of annoyed.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.460]   I'm feeling kind of upset about everything.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.140]   It's frustrating that I can't travel.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.180]   It's frustrating that we can't do this.
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.980]   Why is the government with some of these policies
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.060]   that they have, like, we don't understand some of it.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.500]   And it's frustrating and it's hard,
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.140]   and it makes us that way.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.980]   Here's the thing, so much of the Christian faith
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.940]   is never going to be felt in you.
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.620]   It has to be faithed in you.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.540]   Oh, I just made that up.
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.140]   That was really good.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.220]   So much of the Christian faith is not felt in us.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.540]   It's faithed in us.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.980]   It's something that comes out of us,
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.500]   even when we don't really feel it,
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.020]   because we believe in God's word,
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.340]   we accept his promises,
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.220]   and we desire to walk those things out,
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.580]   whether we feel like it or not.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.820]   Obedience is not a feeling game.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.420]   Obedience is a faith game.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.340]   And I wonder at the start of this year,
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.260]   even though we may not be feeling it,
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.500]   we might be at a faith something.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.740]   So over the next January and February,
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.660]   over the next two months,
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.340]   we're going to lean into this idea of dreaming again.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.340]   There are 21 dreams, literal dreams,
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.100]   that God gives somebody when they're asleep in the Bible
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.780]   that tells them to do something.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.740]   There are 21 of them.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.420]   We're going to look at seven of those
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.660]   over these coming weeks.
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.580]   And each one is designed to help you to understand
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.620]   how God might be speaking into you
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.900]   and moving in your life in this season.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.700]   The schedule here behind me will show you the ways
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.780]   in which we are going to do that over these coming weeks.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.060]   And I'm really excited with that.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.100]   And I tell you, if you get these devotionals
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.380]   that we've already spoken about during this service,
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.260]   if you have those downloaded into your inbox every day
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.020]   from Monday the 10th onwards,
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.460]   I believe that will also be a blessing to you
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.220]   and a great partnership on a daily basis
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.420]   to help you think about what it might mean
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.900]   for you to dream again.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.380]   Is this making sense to everyone?
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.260]   All right, here's how I want to start the series.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.100]   Here's how I want to introduce it to us.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.020]   I believe that there are some basic foundational principles
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.060]   for what God would want in us to dream again.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.140]   And I want to open up some of these very basic,
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.300]   but very importantly, foundational ideas
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.820]   for you so that you can start this year with the idea,
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.220]   I'm gonna take some of those dreams off the shelf
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.900]   and I'm gonna work them out in my life.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.900]   And to do that, I want to take us to perhaps
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.020]   the greatest dreamer in the Bible,
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.020]   the one who is certainly the greatest interpreter
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.020]   of dreams in the Bible, and that's Daniel.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.900]   And Daniel was raised up by God to dream again
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.540]   at a time that was critical in Israel's history,
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.380]   a time when Israel desperately needed to dream again,
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.420]   a time when they were in exile.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.340]   Babylon had come into Jerusalem,
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.100]   destroyed much of Jerusalem, destroyed the temple,
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.900]   pulled down the walls, killed many,
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.980]   taken a remnant of the Israelites into captivity in Babylon.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.540]   One of those remnants was Daniel.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.940]   And Daniel, as the scriptures say in Daniel chapter one,
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.900]   was invited into the court of the king of Babylon,
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.020]   Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.300]   Now being invited into the court,
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.140]   you should read there, was a slave to the king, essentially.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.100]   He didn't have a choice.
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.980]   He was a slave to serve the king in his court.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.740]   Now, right as this is happening,
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.340]   the king begins to have some dreams,
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.340]   and these dreams are hard for him to understand.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.980]   They're disturbing dreams.
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.620]   He doesn't fully get them,
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.980]   and they cause a lot of anxiety for him.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.540]   And that's where we're gonna pick up the story.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.620]   Are you ready for this?
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.220]   The first scripture that we're gonna read together
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.060]   in the new year.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:37.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.300]   (congregation applauding)
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.380]   All right, here we go.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.780]   (laughing)
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.540]   All right, here we go.
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.060]   Daniel chapter two, starting at verse one.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.900]   In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.940]   His mind was troubled and he could not sleep.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.980]   Who knows that when you cannot sleep, you get grumpy, amen?
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.540]   I wanna show you what grumpiness looks like
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.380]   when you can't sleep.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.540]   This is really bad grumpiness.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.740]   So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters,
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.460]   sorcerers, and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.300]   When they came in, they stood before the king.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.420]   And he said to them, "I have had a dream that troubles me,
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.620]   and I want to know what it means."
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.100]   Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic.
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.700]   "Oh, king, live forever.
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.660]   Tell your servants the dream and we will interpret it."
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.340]   The king replied to the astrologers,
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.140]   "This is what I have firmly decided
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.580]   because I'm really tired right now.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.540]   If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it,
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.580]   I will have you cut into pieces
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.740]   and your houses turned into piles of rubble."
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.740]   (laughs)
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.380]   "But if you tell me the dream and explain it,
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.900]   you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.220]   So tell me the dream and interpret to me."
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.340]   Can you believe this?
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.980]   He's like, "You can have cake or death.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.340]   That's your choice, basically.
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.900]   Which one do you want?"
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.660]   "I'll have cake."
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.760]   Once more, they replied,
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.100]   "Let the king tell his servants the dream
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.900]   and we will interpret it."
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.740]   Then the king answered,
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.300]   "I am certain that you're trying to gain more time
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.420]   because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.300]   If you do not tell me the dream,
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.060]   there is just one penalty for you, cake or death.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.180]   You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things,
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.940]   hoping the situation will change.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.900]   So then, tell me the dream
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.620]   and I will know that you can interpret it for me."
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.580]   The astrologers answered the king this way,
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.020]   "There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.460]   No king, however great and mighty,
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.580]   has ever asked such a thing of any magician
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.220]   or enchanter or astrologer.
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.500]   What the king asks is too difficult.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.820]   No one can reveal it to the king except the gods,
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.700]   and they do not live among men."
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.180]   Man, this is the astrologers giving up.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.900]   It's like, "We cannot do this.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.260]   It's impossible for us.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.420]   The only thing that can do this is the gods,
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.780]   but they do not live on earth."
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.980]   This is really ironic because in chapter seven of Daniel,
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.580]   Daniel's gonna have a dream and he's gonna see Jesus,
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.180]   and he's gonna call him the son of man.
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.900]   God being man on earth.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.620]   But at this point in Daniel,
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.300]   the astrologers speaking the truth.
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.540]   They don't know that there is any man
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.060]   that could ever come on earth that can be like God.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.700]   And they say this, "Only the gods can answer this."
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.780]   And ironically, this is actually the only thing
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.660]   that the astrologers are saying that is true.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.060]   And it's actually invitation
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.060]   into the first basic foundation of dreaming again.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.780]   It's this, it is always a work of grace.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.260]   All the dreams that we ever receive,
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.580]   all of the ways that we're able to interpret them,
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.460]   they're always a work of the grace of God.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.380]   It is only God, not gods,
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.700]   God who holds the dreams of this world.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.300]   It is only Him that gives those dreams.
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.580]   And it's only Him that can help us to understand
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.300]   those dreams through the power of His spirit at work in us.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.620]   The astrologers are right.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.420]   It is grace and grace alone that gives us these dreams.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.500]   So when you're thinking about all those things
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.220]   that are on the shelf, those stuff that God has given you,
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.660]   the dreams and the heart that He's placed upon you,
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.020]   and we've shoved those up for that time on the shelf,
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.300]   His grace challenges us to go,
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.340]   these are grace gifts of God.
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.300]   He's given them to us out of His heart.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.620]   He could do it without us.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.140]   He's chosen to use us.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.660]   And He's given me this gift,
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.940]   and He's helped me to understand what His dream is.
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.860]   And if I keep that on the shelf,
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.180]   then I'm ignoring the very grace that He's put in our lives.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:34.020]   The gift of grace means that we haven't earned these dreams.
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.580]   We are not ones who demand these dreams.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.500]   These dreams are His gift to us.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.060]   And because they're His gift,
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.180]   how dare we keep them up on the shelf?
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.180]   We must grab a hold of the things that God has said to us,
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.620]   and in His timing and in His ability,
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.540]   begin to walk those out.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.940]   The first foundation is recognizing
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.740]   it's all a work of grace.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.300]   Are you with me?
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.140]   Here's the second one.
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.300]   Let's read on.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.060]   Verse 12, "This made the king so angry and furious
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.820]   that he ordered the execution
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.700]   of all the wise men of Babylon.
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.220]   You did not choose cake.
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.580]   You have chosen death.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.260]   I'm going to kill you.
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.980]   So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.700]   The men were sent to look for Daniel
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.300]   and his friends to put them to death.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.620]   When Ariok, the commander of the king's guard,
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.660]   had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon,
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.260]   Daniel spoke with him in wisdom and tact.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.620]   He asked the king's officer,
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.740]   'Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?'
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.460]   Ariok then explained the matter to Daniel.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.420]   At this, Daniel went into the king and asked for time
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.540]   so that he might interpret the dream for him."
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.900]   I want you to see this.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.380]   Daniel finds out that this king has received these dreams,
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.700]   that he's going to plan to kill all of the wise men,
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.940]   which included him and his friends as well.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.660]   And Daniel's immediate response
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.700]   is not to run in the opposite direction.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.220]   It's not to run away and try and hide.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.620]   He runs towards the danger.
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.700]   He runs right into the court of the king.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.620]   He goes right up to Nebuchadnezzar himself,
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.300]   and he says, "I need some time.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.820]   I want to plead for you for time,"
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.060]   which is ironic because that's what the astrologers
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:09.900]   were doing.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.340]   But here's Daniel coming directly to the king and saying,
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.700]   "I can, I will interpret this.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.580]   It will happen, but I just need a little bit of time.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.740]   Don't kill anybody.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.100]   Would you work with me here?
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.740]   But I can do this."
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.100]   This is the second principle of dreaming again.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.020]   Not only is this going to be a work of grace,
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:28.940]   but here's the thing.
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.020]   You have to have faith.
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.020]   You have to have faith.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.660]   It took a huge amount of courage and bravery and faith
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.700]   for Daniel to stand in front of the king,
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.300]   a king who just like that
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.340]   could literally have him cut into pieces
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.460]   and pull down the rubble of his home.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.620]   And he stood before this king,
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.660]   his life in the balance,
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.300]   and had the faith and the audacity to say,
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.220]   "I know someone who can interpret this dream.
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.260]   I believe there is someone."
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.220]   Some of you in this room,
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.620]   in order for you to take those things
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.420]   that are on the shelf in your life right now
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.140]   and begin to work them out in your life in 2022,
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.660]   it's gonna take an incredible amount of bravery.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.940]   It's gonna take a lot of bravery and courage and faith
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.340]   for you to do that.
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.540]   And that's not a small thing.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.860]   I want you to realize this.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:18.100]   God doesn't give a dream that doesn't require faith.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.660]   God will never give you a dream that is easy
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.300]   and you don't need to do anything.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.580]   God will always give you a dream
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.660]   where it'll require a stretching of your abilities,
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.380]   a stretching of your faith,
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.460]   because he's calling you to partnership with him.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.940]   He's not calling you to watch what he does.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.060]   He's calling you to partnership with him.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.420]   He'll give you that dream.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.900]   He'll help you to interpret it.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.060]   He'll walk with you,
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.740]   but you'll need to have that faith.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.900]   You see, in the relationship dynamic with God,
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.340]   God's position is to give the gift and grace.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.100]   Our position is to implement it in faith.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.220]   Are you with me?
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.260]   So it's always gonna require faith.
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.140]   And some of us, that's the prayer at the start of 2022.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.340]   I need the faith, Lord, to take this thing off the shelf
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.780]   'cause it's comfortable to leave it on the shelf.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.900]   Remember I said in my own dream experience,
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.260]   hope deferred makes the heart sick.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.460]   It was easier for me to keep it on the shelf,
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.260]   but it would take faith for me
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.020]   to believe in that dream again.
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.020]   It'll take some faith for some of you
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.820]   to take that dream off the shelf.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.660]   Is this helping someone?
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.740]   All right, let's carry on.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.300]   Verse 17.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.820]   Then Daniel returned to his house
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.540]   and explained the matter to his friends,
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.620]   Hananiah, and Mishael, and Nazareth.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.980]   He urged them to plead to mercy from God of heaven,
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.500]   proclaiming and concerning this mystery
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.100]   so that he and his friends might not be executed
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.020]   with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.740]   The very first thing that Daniel does
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.220]   after he's gone before the king
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.260]   and he's realized this is all a grace work,
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.100]   I'm gonna have faith before the king.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.500]   The very first thing he does is he turns around,
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.540]   he goes back to his friends, and he says, I need your help.
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.700]   Come on, guys, come on, friends, get around me.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.860]   We need to pray together.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.500]   We need to pray and plead for mercy from God,
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.740]   because if we don't get that mercy, we're gonna die.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.580]   So there's an importance here.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.420]   Let's get together as brothers,
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.140]   and we're gonna pray and believe
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.140]   that God's gonna give us this interpretation of this dream.
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.060]   We haven't even got a clue what the dream is,
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.220]   but we're gonna pray and ask God in faith together.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.380]   Would you join me, is what he says to his friends.
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.460]   This is the third foundation of dreaming again.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.020]   You have to involve your community.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.020]   You got to involve the people around you
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.820]   in the dreams that God has given you in your life,
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.780]   'cause they're not just for you.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.780]   The dreams are there to inspire the people
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.540]   who are walking around you.
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.140]   The dreams are there to be shared,
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.020]   because the burden is always going to be too much for you
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.680]   on your shoulders alone.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.360]   You've gotta have a group of people around you
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.820]   that are cheering you on, that are discerning with you,
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.220]   that are listening to you.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.340]   Hear this, out of all of my pastoral time,
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.860]   my pastoral life, I've always noticed this,
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.340]   that the most dangerous people in the church
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.340]   are those that dream in isolation.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.580]   It's a big thing to say.
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.100]   The most dangerous people in church
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.620]   are the ones who dream in isolation.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.820]   In other words, the ones who believe
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.780]   that they and they alone hear the word of God.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.420]   The ones who believe that they and they alone
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.380]   are the ones that understand God's word and interpret it,
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.060]   and have no humility to say,
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.860]   I might have not got that right,
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.100]   and I wonder whether my trusted friends,
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.660]   whether that's in my community group,
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.100]   whether that's in my prayer group,
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.660]   whether that's in my friends and family,
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.500]   I can share this,
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.780]   because I wanna hold God's word seriously,
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.660]   but I have humility in that word,
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.620]   and I know that I don't always hear it right,
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.780]   I don't always get it right,
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.020]   but in community with others, we can discern together,
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.740]   and I can walk with more confidence into the future
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.260]   with that faith, because together we have heard.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.380]   Are you with me?
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.860]   So some of you, your big investment in 2022
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.300]   needs to be in a community,
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.220]   because if you're gonna take that stuff off the shelf,
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.940]   you better have some people you can share it with,
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.260]   who can stand next to you and cheer you on,
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.340]   and walk with you every step of the way.
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.820]   Let's keep going.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.580]   Verse 19, "During the night,
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.060]   the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.620]   Then Daniel praised the God of heaven and said this,
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.500]   'Praise be to the name of God forever and ever.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.340]   Wisdom and power are his.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.380]   He changes times and seasons.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.260]   He sets up kings and he disposes them.
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.980]   He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.260]   He reveals deep and hidden things.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.500]   He knows what lies in darkness and the light dwells in him.
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.380]   Oh, I thank you and I praise you, O God of my fathers,
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.420]   for you have given me wisdom and power.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.900]   You have made known to me what is asked of you.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.540]   You have made known to us the dream of the king.'"
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.020]   Notice this, the very first thing that he does here
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.060]   is he responds in worship.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.860]   As soon as he has that dream,
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.940]   as soon as he understands what it is,
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.180]   he responds in worship.
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.140]   He doesn't immediately rush into the king,
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.780]   which is probably what I would have done
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.860]   'cause I've got the answer and I don't wanna die.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.860]   I would have probably rushed straight into the king
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.060]   and said, "I've got the answer.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.800]   Here it is, please don't kill me."
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.300]   The very first thing Daniel does,
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.260]   even though it creates more of a delay, is he worships.
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.180]   He says, "I need to go before the source.
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.020]   Let's give me this thing."
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.780]   And notice the words he uses.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.060]   He says to God, "You have wisdom.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.500]   You have power.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.180]   You're the one who knows and reveals deep and hidden things."
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.380]   He gives all of the power to God,
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.300]   but then he says later in the praise, he says,
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.140]   "But you have given me wisdom and power.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.060]   I am now able to discern
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.620]   and make known the dream to the king."
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.660]   In other words, do you see the partnership?
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.820]   God's vision, our implementation.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.460]   God has the power and the wisdom.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.540]   I've been given that by a grace gift of God.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.900]   I'm gonna, first of all, before I do anything else,
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.180]   recognize where that gift has come from.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:43.580]   When we don't worship for the dreams that we're given,
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.340]   we come to think that the dreams are ours and not God's.
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:51.020]   Our ability to worship in response to the dreams
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.580]   that we are given is our ability to remain humble
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:58.540]   and our ability to remain that this is God's dream, not mine.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.100]   He's the one with wisdom and power.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.460]   He's the one who can reveal all the mysteries.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.100]   And I'm just so graced that he has enabled me to do that
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.960]   in this particular time with this king.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.800]   Are you with me?
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.980]   Your worship will keep you humble.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:15.380]   Your worship will keep the dream God's and not yours.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.020]   Finally, verse 24.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.780]   "Then Daniel went to Ariok, whom the king had appointed
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.420]   to execute the wise men of Babylon and said to him this,
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.660]   'Do not execute the wise men of Babylon.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.740]   Take me to the king
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.180]   and I will interpret his dream for him.'
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.340]   Ariok took Daniel to the king at once and said,
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.900]   'I found a man among the exiles from Judah
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.380]   who can tell the king what the dream means.'
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.840]   So the king asked Daniel, also called Balaal-Savar,
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.240]   'Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.760]   and interpret it?'
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.380]   Daniel replied, 'No wise man, enchanter, magician,
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.000]   or diviner can explain to the king the mystery
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.480]   of what he's just asked about.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries.'"
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.040]   I love this.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.160]   The thing he does is he stands before Nebuchadnezzar
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.160]   and he testifies the gospel.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.620]   He says, "I can't do it.
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.300]   None of your astrologers can do it.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.180]   No magician can do it, but don't be fooled.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.180]   There is a God who reveals mysteries."
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.540]   See, I love this idea.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.260]   See, this is the final foundation of dreaming again.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:22.020]   It is this, that we have to truly know who our God is.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.940]   Like really know who he is.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.340]   'Cause when you know who your God is,
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.380]   you will take those dreams off the shelf.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.740]   You won't second guess them.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.980]   You won't diminish them.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.740]   You will say, "I know who my God is.
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.180]   I know he has this character.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.400]   I know he has this heart.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.040]   I know he wants to do this in the world.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.840]   I know he's at work in these areas.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.100]   I'm gonna take those things off
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.160]   because this is in line with the character of God.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.600]   I know God, this dream is of him.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.320]   And I'm gonna work that dream out in my life."
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.760]   He stands before the king who has his life in his hands.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.880]   And he says, "I can't do it, but God can.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.680]   There is a God who reveals mysteries."
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.320]   I wanna encourage you as you're stepping into 2022,
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.780]   may that be your testimony from your mouth.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.640]   Yes, this is gonna be a hard year ahead.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.340]   I'm not sugar-coating anything.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.140]   We know that there's an ongoing journey with this virus.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.820]   And who knows when Hong Kong might have that virus
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.180]   and it might have an impact on our lives once again.
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.540]   The reality is this, we cannot start this year
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.180]   with a doom and gloom mentality.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.220]   We cannot start this year thinking that the things
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.220]   just need to remain on the shelf.
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.380]   God has given you dreams.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.220]   He's spoken his word over you.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.280]   And he's done it not just for your benefit.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.140]   He's done it because that's the way the world works.
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.700]   He wants you to go into the world,
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.600]   bringing his heart and his vision to the world around you.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.340]   That's the way the world flourishes.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.640]   If we don't do that, people will stumble over themselves.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.340]   But those who attend to the revealed things of God
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.240]   are the ones who understand his blessing.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:58.240]   The church in 2022 must rise up here in Hong Kong,
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.960]   perhaps more than anywhere.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.680]   Take these foundations of dreaming again and walk that out.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:09.200]   Because we do, my friends, have a God who reveals mysteries,
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.280]   who reveals the things that we could not know
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.000]   unless God told us so.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.360]   All of which brings me back to that dream I received
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   on the 2nd of October, 2010.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:27.800]   Two years after that dream,
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.640]   a full year after I shoved it on the shelf and ignored it,
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.580]   I get a phone call.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.760]   And the phone call is from our social worker.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.400]   And it's the phone call that we've been waiting for.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.480]   And in an excited tone, our social worker,
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.880]   who knows that we've gone through a long, hard journey,
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.120]   says, "Oh, you'll never believe it.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.760]   Today, you guys were matched to a baby girl."
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.200]   And she starts to tell us all about this baby girl.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.280]   And I'm there on the phone with her for 20 minutes.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.400]   And she's telling us every minute detail
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.280]   that they ever knew or know about this girl,
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.400]   about her background, about her family, all of this stuff.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.080]   And the last thing that she tells me,
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.360]   the things that she didn't tell me, is when she was born.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.920]   And so I'm there for like 20 minutes
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.680]   with my heart racing really fast, right?
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.040]   And I'm like, "What is going on?"
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.680]   And so after about 20 minutes, my patience wore out.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.000]   I break into the conversation.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   I said, "Was this child born on the 2nd of October, 2010?"
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.040]   And her stunned silence told me
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.440]   everything I needed to know.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.600]   Mia was born that very day I had the dream.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.880]   And there are some amazing stories
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.280]   as to why it took two years,
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.160]   which I don't have time to tell you today.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.080]   But God held her for us and us for her.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.920]   And he told us on that day,
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.280]   'cause he's a God who reveals mysteries.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.920]   And we knew from that moment
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.960]   that our child had come into the world.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.160]   Ah, God is awesome.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.440]   And those things that you've got up on the shelf,
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.720]   those individual dreams that God has given you,
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.800]   hear his voice over you.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.080]   It's time to dream again.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.160]   Those dreams are a grace gift from him.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.900]   They're gonna require faith in you.
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.720]   They're to be shared with the people around you
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.600]   so you can walk in community with them.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.720]   They are always to be responded to in worship.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.440]   And when you know your God,
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.360]   then you walk in those dreams with confidence, assurance,
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.240]   knowing that his will will be known on earth
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.640]   as it is in heaven.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.540]   Church, let's rise up for it's time to dream again.
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.400]   Could you stand with me?
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.500]   I wanna pray over you.
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:36.360]   And if you're comfortable, I wanna invite you,
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.460]   whether you're online right now or in this room,
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.620]   just open your hands with me, I wanna pray.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:45.800]   Father, we are here gathered at the start of 2022.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.440]   And like Daniel, Father,
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.840]   we find ourselves now standing before you with that heart,
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.960]   that you are a God who reveals mysteries.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.640]   And Lord, there's a lot of mysteries in the world right now.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:02.000]   And Lord, represented in this room and online
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.200]   are many individuals that are carrying mysteries
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.100]   and questions.
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.960]   When will I see my family again?
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:12.080]   When will this virus be under control?
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.180]   When can I travel?
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:18.240]   When can I start that job that I was hoping to start?
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.720]   When can that project really kick off?
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.620]   Lord, in this room, we have many mysteries
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:28.160]   that seem to go unsolved in a time like this.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.480]   And I wonder whether you would just start 2022
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.400]   by perhaps bringing some of those questions before the Lord.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:37.160]   He's big enough, gracious enough, wonderful enough
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.360]   to hear them from us.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:43.040]   Those frustrations we have, the questions and the mysteries
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.660]   that seem to go unanswered.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.060]   And I wanna challenge you to pray some bold prayers
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.200]   at the beginning of this year.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.120]   Like Chris and I who prayed to God and said,
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.820]   "Father, we wanna wake up the day that child is born."
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:58.360]   I wonder what bold prayers the Holy Spirit
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.200]   might be placing in your heart today.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:04.400]   And for some of you, you've been praying those prayers,
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.160]   but you've shoved them up on the shelf.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.560]   Perhaps like me, hope deferred has made your heart
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.380]   a bit sick.
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.440]   Perhaps like me, it's too painful
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.800]   and you've thrown it up on the shelf
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.720]   and gotten on with your life.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.780]   I feel the Holy Spirit would come today
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.940]   and just gently guide you into a place
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.420]   of taking those dreams again and perhaps tentatively,
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.540]   but step-by-step walking into a place of believing
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.720]   and hoping once more.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.200]   Father, for dreams in this room
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.780]   that have seemed a long way off,
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.220]   would you come Holy Spirit?
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:42.520]   Father, would you give us the faith we need?
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.280]   Lord, we know that when you give dreams,
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.740]   it always requires some faith.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.760]   Father, would you give us the boldness we see in Daniel,
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.700]   the courage Lord, to stand before our city,
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.180]   to stand before whatever it is
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.020]   that might be the obstacle in our path
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.380]   and proclaim dreams again, your dreams, your heart.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:06.580]   Father, we are so grateful for community.
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.620]   And Lord, I wanna pray for some people in this room
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.860]   that feel isolated right now.
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.820]   Lord, I wanna ask for the right men and women
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.580]   to come alongside of them this year.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.120]   I pray 2022 would be the birthing of new community
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.340]   for many people here.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.420]   Lord, you do not want us to dream in isolation, Lord.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.740]   So I pray for the right men, the right women,
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.500]   the right resources to come alongside
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:27.460]   of the people in this room
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.700]   that are holding dreams in their heart.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.740]   And I wanna challenge you, if you're isolating yourself,
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.600]   would you hear the wind of the Spirit on you today
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.000]   to step out of your isolation towards community?
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.320]   Father, we worship you.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.680]   We worship you with everything we have.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.820]   Lord, so that we can keep those dreams yours and not ours.
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.060]   And Father, we take whatever it is
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.400]   that we're thinking right now and we place it before you.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.380]   You are a God of all power and all wisdom.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.080]   Lord, we trust your timing.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.080]   As hard as it was for Chris and I to wait those two years,
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.940]   Mia came into our lives at the exact right time.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.780]   And Lord, I believe that will be the same
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.860]   for whatever promises are coming
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.500]   for the people in this room.
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.180]   Lord, would you give us steadfastness in the waiting?
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.180]   Would you give us hope in the waiting, Lord God?
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.760]   Would you give us courage?
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.060]   Father, we wanna dream again.
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.000]   And I pray you would reveal your character
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.280]   and your goodness to us.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.060]   I pray that like Daniel, we'd be able to stand
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.080]   before all of the kings of this world
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.320]   and say there is a God who knows of mysteries.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:33.080]   Now that would be the testimony of our faith
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.700]   to bring you glory on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.300]   Lord, help us to dream.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.720]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.720]   Everyone says.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.560]   - Amen. - Amen.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.460]   Let's respond together in worship.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.040]   (gentle music)
