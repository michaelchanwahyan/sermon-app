1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 So, I have been to church for a long time, since I was really young.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,560
 And because of that, a lot of the aunties and uncles in the church would ask me, "Jun,

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,540
 go and share your testimony with the younger ones."

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,920
 And every time I hear that, I get really nervous.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,120
 Because I don't have a really good story to tell.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,880
 I'm a second generation Christian.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,520
 Well, actually a third, because my grandma was a Christian.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,000
 So I've always grown up knowing God is real.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,400
 I've always known, you know, He is here in my life.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,640
 So I don't have any exciting things to tell.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,440
 And also, when I want to talk about...

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,440
 Away.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
 So, exactly.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:46,240
 Like, sometimes I get really nervous about talking to people and sharing about my story,

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,480
 and there's just not much to say, right?

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,480
 Maybe you need to help me fix it.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:01,760
 Thank you so much.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,440
 So I have nothing, really a lot going on in my life to share.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,960
 Until, until my mom started baking bread.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,160
 Right?

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,280
 So she doesn't just bake her bread in those baking bread machines.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,880
 She would grow her yeast.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,280
 She would knead her bread by hand, and then she would prove it for a really long time.

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,160
 She normally started it in the afternoon, and normally it takes the whole day to do

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
 it.

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,920
 And so by night time, at 11 o'clock, night time, the whole house is filled with the bread

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
 aromas.

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,800
 And she'd go, "Joon, would you like to taste my bread?"

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,640
 And I go, "Mom, I'm full already.

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,160
 I just had dinner not too long ago."

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,320
 And she would be a little bit upset.

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,400
 And she'd go, "Not even a bite of your mom's bread?"

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,080
 I go, "Okay, okay, let me taste it."

34
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,720
 So I would taste it.

35
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,320
 And she would ask me, "Is it good?"

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,920
 "Yeah, it's good."

37
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,920
 And she would always have this follow up question to ask me, "Why is it good?

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
 Why do you like it?

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,240
 How do you compare it with store-bought bread?"

40
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,840
 And so now, as I'm like a few years later, I'm very good at describing the textures and

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,120
 the taste and all the different combinations of bread.

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,120
 And then I thought, "Wow, not only I'm able to articulate it.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,320
 What I say can be a proof for my mom to say that, 'Yes, my bread is good because my daughter

44
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,800
 said this, because this is exactly what she tasted.'"

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,440
 And so fast forward to now, when I realized that, oh, when I have to articulate why something

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,120
 is good, I can remember the details that I easily forgotten.

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,920
 I could put the fleeting feelings into words to share with other people.

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,960
 And testimony sharing is similar to that.

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,160
 It is about sharing and celebrating what God has done in your life, whether it is when

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,720
 you first believe or when you're just experiencing God's presence in your life and the changes

51
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,000
 that he has in your life.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,080
 So stepping into 2025, think about 2024.

53
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,560
 Has it been a really quick year for you?

54
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,040
 Or has this year been a little bit long and dragging and you're wishing that 2025 could

55
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,080
 come sooner?

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,080
 Have you noticed anything that you've changed for yourself?

57
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,880
 And how has God been involved in your life?

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,920
 Today we're going to look at Psalm 66 and see how the Israelites have been reflecting

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,520
 and praising God in their lives to inspire us how we could reflect on our own lives as

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
 well.

61
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,480
 So let's look at Psalm 66, verse one to five first.

62
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,440
 It says, "Shout for joy to God, all the earth.

63
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,360
 Sing about the glory of his name, make his praise glorious.

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,080
 Say to God, how awesome are your deeds because of your great power, your enemies cringe before

65
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
 you.

66
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,920
 All the earth bow down to you.

67
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,860
 They sing praise to you.

68
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,840
 They sing the praises of your name.

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,880
 Come and see what God has done, his awesome deeds for mankind."

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:14,200
 Right from the start, the Psalmist gives very clear guidance on how to praise and what to

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,400
 praise.

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,840
 So how should we praise?

73
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,040
 We need to sing, we need to shout, we need to speak out God's praise.

74
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,260
 But what do we share about?

75
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,720
 We will share about what he has done, his power and his name.

76
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,280
 He is the God of provision.

77
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,000
 He is the almighty God.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,400
 That is his name and that is his personality and character towards us.

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,240
 In verse five, the Psalmist says directly, "Come and see what God has done."

80
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,680
 The English version is actually very closely translated to the Hebrew one because of the

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
 structure.

82
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,920
 They both begin with the verbs, "Come and see."

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,400
 It's not thought, like praise is not a thought that we could go, "Oh, you get me God.

84
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
 You know what?

85
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
 I praise you.

86
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
 I will just keep it in my heart."

87
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,800
 It's not like that at all.

88
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,200
 The Psalmist actually is calling his community to come and see what God has done in their

89
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
 life.

90
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,240
 It's so urgency.

91
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,800
 Come quickly and see what God has done.

92
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,100
 When we look back at what God has done in our lives, we naturally want to tell other

93
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,200
 people to come and see it, to come and experience it for yourself.

94
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,600
 So I had this really good experience like that as well.

95
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,520
 So this month, the beginning of December, I found this really delicious yakitori place

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,400
 just next to my building.

97
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,560
 And so with just this month, I had it five times because I kept telling my friend, my

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,320
 family, my old co-workers to, you have to come and see the place because the favorite

99
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,560
 thing I love about that place is their eel skewers.

100
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,800
 Do you eat eel here?

101
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
 Who eats eel?

102
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,680
 Oh, there are some of you who like, no, I'm not going to try that.

103
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,400
 Well, this eel is so good because the skin is very crispy.

104
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,960
 And when you bite into it, the juice just burst out and the meat is just so bouncy and

105
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
 it's just so delicious.

106
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,360
 And I kept telling people, you have to come and see it.

107
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,760
 And so I had this five times.

108
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,920
 And so this is exactly what my reflection is like.

109
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,780
 I have to go home and think about, did I reflect about what God has been in my life like that?

110
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:35,040
 If I savor it so much that I would want to share with other people as well.

111
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,480
 And so then in verse five to seven and eight to 12, this is exactly what the Psalmist did.

112
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,960
 He wants to testify God's goodness in two different angles.

113
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,720
 The first one comes in verse five to seven.

114
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,880
 It says, "Come and see what God has done, his awesome deeds for mankind.

115
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,780
 He turned the sea into dry land.

116
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,300
 They passed through the waters on foot.

117
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,580
 Come, let us rejoice in him.

118
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,220
 He rules forever by his power.

119
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,260
 His eyes watch the nations.

120
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,640
 Let not the rebellious rise up against him."

121
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,280
 The Psalmist give thanks for the identity God has given them.

122
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,300
 So the Israelites before that, before they were a nation, they actually had been slaves

123
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,200
 of the Egyptian slaves.

124
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:31,040
 But God's action set them free and the identity changed to become God's people.

125
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,260
 Even though the Psalmist never experienced God, you know, opening up the Red Sea for

126
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,760
 them and he actually walked through the dry land.

127
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,320
 But this is the identity they refer to.

128
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,240
 When you ask the Israelites, "Who are you?

129
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
 Where do you come from?"

130
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,840
 The first thought that come into their mind is the way that God set the nations free and

131
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,800
 give them identity.

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,040
 When we talk about identity nowadays, we would say that, "Oh, I am," like if you ask me a

133
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,920
 few years ago, I would say, "Oh, I am a teacher.

134
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,760
 I was someone else's daughter and I belong to this and that place."

135
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,040
 But the first thing that Israelites, when they want to praise God, the first thing that

136
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,820
 come out of their mouth is the identity, the relationship they had with God.

137
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,000
 God set me free.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,360
 God took me out from some place, from slavery into freedom, into God's people.

139
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,920
 So when I ask you, if you have to ask yourself this question, "What is your identity right

140
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
 now?

141
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,980
 Who do you belong to?

142
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:35,340
 What would you have said differently or what inspired you to think about that question?"

143
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,000
 And so they ask people to come and see where they are at now.

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,560
 I am now free.

145
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,220
 I am now God's people.

146
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,220
 So come and see.

147
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,920
 It's not just to come and look at them, but to come and consider, come and think about

148
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
 this.

149
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,680
 Do you see who I am now?

150
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,780
 I am God's people.

151
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,180
 This can't be achieved by just mere human striving.

152
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,940
 This has to be done by God's power.

153
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,560
 And you just have to look and consider and think about where I am now.

154
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,400
 And in verse 8 to 12, it talked about the hardship.

155
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,040
 But looking back, they understood something deeper through the process.

156
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,080
 So let's have a look at verse 8 to 12.

157
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,260
 Verse 8, it says, "Praise our God, all peoples.

158
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,400
 Let the sounds of his praise be heard.

159
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,000
 He has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,880
 For you, God, tested us.

161
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,480
 You refined us like silver.

162
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,760
 You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs.

163
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,920
 You let people ride over our heads.

164
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,480
 We went through fire and water.

165
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,880
 But you brought us to a place of abundance."

166
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,000
 When we remember God's work during hardships, we can see things differently.

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,760
 There are many explanations or why suffering happens.

168
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,920
 Sometimes there are no explanation why there are sufferings as well.

169
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,720
 But God is always working.

170
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,900
 He's always at work.

171
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,440
 When the psalmists remember their difficulty, they see a purpose behind it.

172
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,000
 In verse 10, the psalmist says God refines them like silver.

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,080
 Even though they were trapped and burdened, even though they suffered, they saw this as

174
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,140
 spiritual refinement.

175
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,760
 So how do you refine silver?

176
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,080
 How do you refine silver?

177
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:39,200
 Well, the first step is to heat up silver to really high temperature, as high as 1,000

178
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
 degrees.

179
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,840
 And then they put lead into it.

180
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,880
 The lead attracts all the other impurities, all the other substances, and it actually

181
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,920
 weighted them down.

182
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,320
 All the impurities will be weighted down until there's only silver left at the bottom.

183
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,920
 But the craftsmen still need to watch over it.

184
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:05,340
 They still need to discern whether the silver is pure enough by seeing how it reflects.

185
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,240
 And so this is until the silver is mirror-like.

186
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,480
 And the psalmist says God made them carry heavy burdens.

187
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,240
 God led them through different challenges.

188
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,480
 They went through fire and water.

189
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,280
 But these were not the final destination.

190
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:30,240
 The purpose for all of that is to bring them to a place of abundance.

191
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:38,480
 Jesus said He came so we could have life and have it more abundantly.

192
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,760
 What does abundant life look like?

193
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,520
 What does it mean to have an abundant life?

194
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,480
 Here's something interesting.

195
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,760
 When Jesus talks about abundance, He never once mentioned our possessions.

196
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
 Not once.

197
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,200
 He talks about peace that goes beyond understanding.

198
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,840
 He talks about joy that persists even in hard times.

199
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,240
 He talks about relationship that fills our hearts.

200
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,520
 The process of getting an abundant life requires our hearts to keep up with our understanding.

201
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,840
 Sometimes there are good things that happen and we rejoice and we feel directly of God's

202
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,120
 love and God's mercy and grace, gracious things on us.

203
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,200
 Sometimes we have to go through difficult times to adjust our hearts so that we can

204
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,180
 be refined.

205
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:37,400
 The process of getting an abundant life requires our hearts to keep up with our understanding.

206
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,880
 When does a craftsman know that the silver is good enough?

207
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,480
 It has high reflectivity and no impurities.

208
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,920
 The craftsman have to watch over the silver's transformation.

209
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,600
 They have to look at your transformation, the silver's transformation, and test its

210
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,040
 reflectivity.

211
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,400
 Through difficulties, God refines us.

212
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:10,200
 God constantly watches over my life so that it can better reflect His image.

213
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,400
 And I'm thankful for our heavenly brother for doing that.

214
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,440
 And today I've invited three friends to come up and share what God has been doing in their

215
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
 life.

216
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,400
 And today they would like to tell you to come and see what God has done in their lives.

217
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,840
 Not just to see what God is doing, but think about it and consider how things are done.

218
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,040
 And so the first one I'd like to invite Francesca, let's give her a warm welcome.

219
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,000
 So we've always known Francesca, she is service leading, she's in the coffee team, she's in

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,620
 many different, different roles.

221
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,480
 But today she's going to share about what God has been doing in her life.

222
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,680
 So I'm going to give the time to Francesca.

223
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,320
 Thank you.

224
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
 Thank you, June.

225
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
 Great.

226
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,120
 I'm really excited, you know, to share with you what God has done in my life.

227
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,720
 And I really love today's psalm.

228
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,400
 And, you know, I am someone with passion, if you know me.

229
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,800
 And when there's good restaurant, I'm one of those.

230
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,560
 I'm like, come to this restaurant.

231
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,400
 So I'd love to share with you, you know, one of the many great things that God has done

232
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,840
 in my life in 2024.

233
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,920
 Now, but before that, I want to give you some a little bit of context of my background as

234
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
 well.

235
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,480
 I wasn't raised a Christian.

236
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,480
 And when I became a Christian in my early 20s, I became very passionate about my faith.

237
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,120
 And I was so eager to share this gospel, this new knowledge that I gained.

238
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,120
 And you know, you've got to share good news, the good things, right?

239
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,600
 Now, especially with my mom.

240
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,040
 None of my families are Christian.

241
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,920
 And I'm the only one at that time.

242
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,840
 And it's always my hope and dreams for her to become Christian.

243
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,040
 And most importantly, to know Jesus, to walk a life full of freedom and peace.

244
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,200
 Now, however, it hasn't been easy.

245
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,880
 My mom has been quite resistant in the past 10 years or so for various reasons.

246
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:04,480
 Now, one of the main reasons is that we have a very important family member, someone that

247
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,880
 it's very important to her and our family.

248
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,400
 He's a Buddhist.

249
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,120
 And he was actually, he used to be a Catholic, and then he became a Buddhist, the whole family.

250
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,600
 And this person is deeply devoted to his faith.

251
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,000
 And he's super disciplined, highly educated, and very influential.

252
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,320
 He actually would write books and give talks about Buddhism, right?

253
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,280
 So he's like a pastor Buddha kind of thing.

254
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,280
 Now, I, you know, my mom has so much respect, you know, and looks up to him.

255
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,740
 And actually, so do I, because growing up, he's someone that's so important to our family.

256
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,680
 And I see what he, you know, what he does for this society.

257
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,000
 And he contributes so much.

258
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,560
 He's one of the kindest and most generous person I've known as well.

259
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,120
 But since I became a Christian, I've seen him as the obstacle to my mom's faith journey.

260
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
 Why?

261
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,520
 Because on one hand, I would share gospel and good news with my mom, right?

262
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,560
 And you know, talk about Jesus and what I know.

263
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,240
 And then on the other hand, he would just, you know, tell him, tell my mom about Buddhism,

264
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,560
 you know, what you need to do.

265
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,320
 And on one hand, I would try to get rid of all the statues at home, and you know, try

266
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,360
 to, you know, have, you know, a home that I feel peace.

267
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,600
 But on the other hand, he would, you know, give my mom all these blessed statues, you

268
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,200
 know, Gunyama, and then like all these cards and, you know, all this music and sound.

269
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,760
 And you can imagine it wasn't easy, especially not easy for my mom, you know, being, standing

270
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,320
 in between two people that she loves the most, having two different, very, two very different

271
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
 faiths.

272
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,800
 Now, at that time, as a new and eager Christian, I was on fire to share gospel.

273
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,400
 And I was very protective of my new faith.

274
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,760
 And I was very protective of my mom.

275
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,560
 I desperately wanted her to know Jesus, right?

276
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,080
 And of course, I don't want her to fall out of faith, right?

277
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:52,640
 Like, so out of that eagerness, good intention, I became, you know, would sometimes come across

278
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,280
 as forceful and impatient.

279
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,860
 I'm sure some of you have come across those Christians once in your life, or you might

280
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,240
 be one of them too, you know.

281
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,480
 You know, that eagerness made me become so impatient as I, you know, trying to share

282
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
 gospel.

283
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,600
 Because I wanted to achieve something.

284
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,720
 I wanted my mom to know Jesus, but she just wouldn't come around.

285
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,040
 I felt so helpless.

286
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,880
 And I just, you know, sometimes to a point, I just feel so frustrated.

287
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,920
 I'm like, I can't do this.

288
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,840
 And up to a point, I just gave up.

289
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
 And I'm like, "Mom, you know, why do you?

290
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,160
 You know, believe Buddha, whatever.

291
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,800
 You believe in whatever faith you want.

292
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,360
 It's your life.

293
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,000
 Whatever."

294
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,360
 Is it really whatever?

295
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
 It's not really.

296
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,760
 I think behind that, it was just that sense of disappointment and frustration and exhaustion.

297
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,920
 Because I've tried, I've tried to share the news, I've tried to love her, and it just

298
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,400
 doesn't get to her.

299
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,640
 So I was like, "It's impossible.

300
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
 Whatever."

301
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,600
 Now, a few years ago, four or five years ago, someone from church, really grateful for this

302
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,920
 person, she prayed for me, you know, because throughout the year, she would pray, the whole

303
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,400
 community would come and pray for me and my family, especially my mom, right?

304
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,040
 And this person prayed for me, and she prophesied that my mom, she can see that my mom will

305
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,520
 go through a huge internal transformation, like a renovation inside of her, and that

306
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,800
 God will take care of her.

307
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:24,040
 Now since then, God has softened my heart, and so many miracles have happened.

308
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,800
 God has done so much in my family.

309
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,240
 And my mom, long story short, that's a huge testimony, it will take up another 30 minutes,

310
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,120
 but long story short, we got rid of all the statues at home, all of them, and my mom willing

311
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,800
 to get rid of them.

312
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:45,960
 And also, as my mom's heart's getting softer and softer, we eventually, we pray, and she

313
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,480
 prayed to accept Jesus Christ in her life.

314
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,240
 Right, let's give praise to God.

315
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,840
 But the story doesn't end here.

316
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,520
 Now, after she accepted Jesus Christ, you know, she was still afraid to share with this

317
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,600
 family, important family member of ours, right?

318
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,680
 How do we tell this person that, "Oh, we chuck all your statues away."

319
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:13,200
 You know, those are, you know, it will come across disrespectful, right?

320
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,240
 But throughout this time, you know, God has really, really changed my heart and helped

321
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,080
 me realize that everyone has their own faith journey, you know, their own timing.

322
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,080
 Ultimately, it's God who changes people's heart, not me, not what I do and not do.

323
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,320
 And just like how He changes my heart years ago.

324
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,840
 So since then, you know, seeing all the changes in my heart, I start realizing I don't need

325
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,280
 to force my faith onto someone.

326
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,560
 I don't need to persuade other people by reasons and logic because I can't, right?

327
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,000
 All I need to do is just to live it out by loving people and, you know, extending the

328
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,440
 love that I have received from God.

329
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,960
 Now, the amazing thing happened.

330
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,520
 Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to chat with this person one-on-one in a catch-up.

331
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,240
 And throughout this conversation, it's very, very different than before.

332
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,640
 Before I always want to find opportunity to prove him wrong, to, you know, to tell you

333
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,400
 that Jesus is better and my God is real, you know.

334
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,680
 I was that eager.

335
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,080
 But that conversation, it turns out the other way.

336
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,000
 I just, I feel like God really transformed me, that I started to have this gentleness

337
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,320
 in me, that I listen and that I care.

338
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,840
 And out of nowhere, I had this curiosity to just learn about him, understand where he's

339
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
 from.

340
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,840
 So I asked him, you know, I just want to know how come you, you know, you're once a Catholic

341
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,920
 and then now you became a Buddhist.

342
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
 What's behind that?

343
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
 What's your journey?

344
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,400
 You know, what are you pursuing?

345
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,120
 He is someone that's so disciplined, I tell you.

346
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,000
 The way he pursued his faith, it's like something that I so admire.

347
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,920
 And I want to do that for myself.

348
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,360
 And I know out of curiosity, I asked him all the questions he shared.

349
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,960
 And then, of course, he shared the reason why he didn't like Christians and he didn't

350
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,820
 believe this, you know, that just Jesus.

351
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,760
 And I heard him and I understood him and I empathized him because of his past hurt that

352
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,240
 experiences, right?

353
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,440
 And I wasn't there to neglect what he said, but I just to be there and heard his stories.

354
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,920
 And then afterwards, then I gently, very gently just share with him my journey.

355
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,960
 Oh, why do I believe in Jesus?

356
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,400
 And what do I know about Jesus?

357
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,960
 What did Jesus say, right?

358
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,720
 You're people of flaws, but I just tell him what I know about Jesus.

359
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,960
 And then at the end of the conversation, he just looked at me and say this, "I see that

360
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,520
 you're very serious about your faith.

361
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,640
 And what you said, what you're pursuing is good."

362
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,200
 And then there was this pause and then he continue, "Now that I understand what you're

363
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,520
 pursuing, I believe we're seeking the same thing, same God, just in different forms."

364
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,220
 Now, of course, I have a different views on that.

365
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,400
 And then he said, "I will talk to your mom.

366
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,880
 I will tell her to stop pursuing Buddha and to pursue your God wholeheartedly."

367
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,280
 Let's give praise to God.

368
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,520
 What?

369
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,880
 Like this truly blew my mind at the moment.

370
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
 I was like, what?

371
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,620
 He's no longer the obstacle?

372
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,440
 He's no longer the person that, you know, trying to stop my mom pursuing Jesus, but

373
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,960
 actually he, you know, actually what happened was he actually did call my mom afterwards

374
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,400
 and he met up with my mom.

375
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,940
 He visited my mom and then he was like, he told my mom that, "Don't pursue Buddha now.

376
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,940
 Just pursue Jesus.

377
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,120
 Just pursue the God that your daughter's following."

378
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,860
 How?

379
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,440
 This is impossible.

380
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,800
 And again and again, God is just showing me that he is the God that can make the impossible

381
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,100
 possible like this worship songs that we're saying.

382
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,320
 And I was like, "God, you're so amazing."

383
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,820
 And in the past, even though I knew God, I didn't fully understand the true meaning of

384
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,920
 sharing gospel, right?

385
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
 I was just judgmental.

386
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,880
 I tried to share it with my own ways and try to reasons, you know, persuade people with

387
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,880
 reasons and logics.

388
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:02,720
 But throughout this time, God say, "My love, all I want you to do is just to love."

389
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,280
 And I realized I have experienced his love so much that, you know, I would just want

390
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,380
 to give God all the praise for all that he has shown me.

391
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,160
 His love is so gentle and is so patient.

392
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,980
 God, he's so patient with me.

393
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,360
 And I'm just so thankful that I got to first experience his love, then I get to share this

394
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,520
 with my family and my mom.

395
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,960
 And who would have thought this uncle, this family member would actually turn around and

396
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,600
 do this and be on my side, assist me to persuade my mom?

397
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,760
 Only God can do this, right?

398
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,640
 So I also want to say thank you for my community because they've been praying for me days to

399
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,640
 days about my mom and my family.

400
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,880
 I think God put people in my life to walk with me in this journey.

401
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,520
 So I'm just so thankful that God is the one who accomplishes the work.

402
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,760
 All I need to do is just to trust him and walk along in this journey with him.

403
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
 Thank you guys.

404
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,840
 Let's give a big hand to Francesca.

405
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,320
 Thank you so much.

406
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,400
 And I think a lot of families have, maybe you have been through this as well.

407
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,840
 You have been praying for your family member and you want your mom or your dad, your uncle

408
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,400
 to believe in Christ.

409
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:22,400
 And it's been five years, maybe 10 years or maybe over 20 decades, 20 decades.

410
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,280
 It still didn't happen.

411
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,320
 But when you see something happen like that, you know that it is not because of human striving.

412
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,200
 It is because of God's greatness and power.

413
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,640
 And so we thank you, Francesca, for sharing her story and encourage us because what God

414
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,080
 has done in her life is going, this is what God does.

415
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,920
 And it's going, he's going to do it in every single one's life as well.

416
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,680
 And secondly, I'd like to invite Matthias to come and share with us.

417
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,160
 Matthias, someone that in the church very, not too long ago, and he is amazing.

418
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,800
 He is such a willing to heart to serve and to reach out to people.

419
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,120
 So I'd like to give the time to Matthias.

420
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
 Thank you.

421
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
 Thanks June.

422
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
 Hi.

423
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,040
 Like she said, my name is Matthias.

424
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,840
 My family and I have been coming to the Vian Yuen Long for a couple of months now.

425
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,120
 They're not here today.

426
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,560
 They weren't feeling well.

427
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
 But I was okay.

428
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,440
 So you know, maybe there was a reason.

429
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,080
 Maybe someone's supposed to hear this today.

430
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,800
 So yeah, sure.

431
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,040
 Anyway, I've been in Hong Kong.

432
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,960
 My wife and I were missionaries here in Hong Kong for the last nine, 10 years now.

433
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,360
 And we have three kids.

434
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,240
 They were all amazing in many different ways.

435
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:42,160
 And when June had asked for me to share my testimony, I took a deep breath.

436
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:48,120
 And I think what I have here is maybe a little bit of an honest self-reflection of this year

437
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,840
 and my journey with God this year.

438
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,920
 I think 2024 has been an intriguing year.

439
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,640
 It's been very different for me for many different reasons.

440
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,920
 And I think what I've taken out of it is I have learned more about God in a different

441
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,240
 way than I had before.

442
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,200
 And I think that's an amazing thing to do, that God is so big and so wide that we can

443
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,480
 -- there are many different ways we can learn more about him, you know, whether it be through

444
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,480
 the word, through his voice, and through different people.

445
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:27,480
 I think when June was sharing about Psalm 66, I think verse 8 and 10 really reflect

446
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,280
 maybe my journey this year.

447
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,760
 And verse 8 to 10 says -- I'll just read it out.

448
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,160
 It says, "Praise our God, all peoples.

449
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,480
 Let the sound of his praise be heard.

450
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,760
 He has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.

451
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,080
 For you, God, tested us.

452
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,840
 You refined us like silver."

453
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:51,680
 And I think looking back this year, there have been many highs and many lows.

454
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,560
 But when I look back, I think there has been a lot of growth.

455
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:01,320
 I think there's a bit of more a reflection of maybe the maturity that I've grown, that

456
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,640
 I can look and see, oh, I look high of maturity.

457
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:11,440
 And that's really just all praise to God.

458
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:18,000
 So this year, my family and I, we decided to take a sabbatical.

459
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,400
 If you're not sure what sabbatical means, it's just really taking a pause from what

460
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,640
 we've been doing.

461
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,240
 So like I said, we've been missionaries with our missions organization for the last 9,

462
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,520
 10 years.

463
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,160
 And we decided to take a break.

464
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:39,400
 And it kind of led to also us stepping out from our positions and really becoming unemployed.

465
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,640
 So we felt that we were going to take a year to pause and reflect.

466
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,960
 It's a long time.

467
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,800
 And for the first six months, we were not to make any decisions or pray or talk about

468
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
 our future.

469
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,280
 We were just supposed to stop.

470
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,560
 We were just supposed to rest, although with three kids.

471
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,080
 Rest is a very different -- it takes a very different meaning.

472
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,640
 But yes, so to rest and not do anything.

473
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,520
 And I don't know if you're like me.

474
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,000
 When you're faced with something, oh, don't think about the future and you have no plans

475
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,760
 for the future, it kind of just keeps coming back.

476
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,040
 And it became very difficult.

477
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:38,000
 Because for me, in our situation, one, well, there's -- what are we going to do?

478
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Right?

479
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 There's so much uncertainty.

480
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,720
 There are so many different potential opportunities as well for us to do.

481
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,520
 And I'm from Singapore, although my family lives in Australia.

482
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,240
 Long story.

483
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,720
 My wife's from America.

484
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,400
 And we live in Hong Kong.

485
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,600
 So there are many different directions we could take as well.

486
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,940
 We could live in all these different countries.

487
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,820
 We could remain on the mission field.

488
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,920
 We could not remain on the mission field.

489
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,380
 We could, you know, be missionaries in a different location.

490
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,400
 And so there are many different directions that we could have taken.

491
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,560
 And there are many different opportunities as well.

492
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
 People come and talk to us.

493
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,640
 They're like, oh, would you be interested in doing this?

494
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,080
 And I'm like, maybe.

495
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
 I don't know.

496
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,800
 I can't tell you yet.

497
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:33,920
 Or if you're a little older and you are a grandparent who loves grandchildren, you might

498
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,200
 be, hey, maybe you want to come live in this country that I live so that I can see my

499
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,520
 grandparent -- my grandchildren more.

500
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,080
 And we're like, yeah, sure.

501
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
 That's possible.

502
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,080
 Maybe.

503
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,080
 Maybe.

504
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
 You know?

505
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,280
 And free child care is also good.

506
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:03,320
 But I think what I'm trying to say is there are many different things that we could do.

507
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,120
 And a lot of people who offer had good intentions.

508
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,000
 No one was like, oh, you should do this or you need to do that.

509
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,480
 One other factor in our lives is that as missionaries we live on financial support.

510
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,200
 So people support us financially.

511
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,760
 Whether it be churches or individuals, family and friends.

512
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,360
 Because they believe in what we're doing.

513
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,000
 They believe in the work that we're doing here in Hong Kong.

514
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 But guess what?

515
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,200
 This year we're not doing any work.

516
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,760
 And so we have a responsibility to tell them, oh, hey, these are our plans.

517
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,960
 This is what God is saying to us.

518
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,840
 This is our direction in our lives.

519
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,760
 But there was no direction.

520
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,840
 So then what?

521
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,160
 And honestly, all supporters were great.

522
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,480
 None of them actually asked me any of these questions.

523
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,760
 None of them were like, okay, what are you guys going to do now?

524
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,000
 And how's my money being used?

525
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,920
 Actually, they were all very supportive and all very great.

526
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,600
 I think a lot of the pressure was self inflicted.

527
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:14,880
 A lot of maybe the worry to answer these potential questions down the line was all self inflicted.

528
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,520
 That I started to worry.

529
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,640
 I started to question.

530
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,120
 And yeah.

531
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:30,560
 It made that time, you know, very -- just uncertain.

532
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,920
 Very unsure of our future.

533
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:44,600
 I think especially in that time as well, I was -- you know, when we would then seek God

534
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:51,280
 or ask questions about our future, there was nothing.

535
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
 You know?

536
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,320
 And it's not like God was not present.

537
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,400
 You know, in worship or in my quiet time.

538
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
 He was there.

539
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
 He was present.

540
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,120
 You know, you feel the love and the peace.

541
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:08,800
 But in regards to seeking direction and asking these questions, nothing.

542
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,600
 And that silence was very loud.

543
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
 Right?

544
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,600
 It was very loud.

545
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,240
 And you know, God -- I'm sure you all get to that.

546
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,800
 But it was not an easy time at that time.

547
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,400
 Because of what I felt was, you know, our responsibility.

548
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,940
 What I felt was just -- I guess maybe in my mind, what would be great, right?

549
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,760
 Maybe you all would think that way too.

550
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,600
 Is that if God would just say, okay, this is what I have for you next.

551
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,000
 Enjoy the rest of your sabbatical.

552
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Oh!

553
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,200
 Wouldn't that be such a joy?

554
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
 Right?

555
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,400
 Like, yes, future settled.

556
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,240
 Now just rest.

557
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
 Peace.

558
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
 You know?

559
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,960
 But for some reason, and God has his reasons.

560
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,880
 It did not work out that way.

561
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:07,120
 I think what I learned was that there was a need to really just take time to process,

562
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,120
 take time to end well a previous season, a long season that we have been in.

563
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,520
 So that we will be better prepared.

564
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,320
 So that we would not be carrying any negative baggage into the next thing that we were about

565
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,900
 to go into.

566
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,900
 And guess what?

567
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,900
 That took six months.

568
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,900
 Right?

569
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,240
 And that's our journey.

570
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,080
 Our journey might be different.

571
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,920
 But it was necessary, actually.

572
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
 It was needed.

573
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:44,200
 And I think what also ended up really helping in that time was just being -- going through

574
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
 it with my wife.

575
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
 Right?

576
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,440
 That we were doing it together.

577
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
 Right?

578
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,640
 That we were always then when faced with those questions that would come up, we would be

579
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,240
 like, "But God said we weren't supposed to do anything in this first six months.

580
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:06,440
 We weren't supposed to make a decision or decide about anything in this first six months."

581
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
 Right?

582
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,680
 So what I think was really encouraging for me was having someone to -- and of course

583
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,200
 for me to her -- was that we had each other to be able to encourage each other.

584
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,360
 To remind us of what God had said.

585
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,660
 Because it's not like he didn't say anything at all.

586
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,320
 He did say something.

587
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,320
 And he expected us to, like, "Hey, first six months.

588
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
 That's it.

589
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
 Don't worry about it."

590
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,320
 Okay?

591
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:37,520
 And having that -- I guess now I'm marrying my wife, too -- encouraged me to, "Hey, don't

592
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
 worry about it.

593
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,560
 One step at a time.

594
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,400
 When it's the right time, then God will speak."

595
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:51,200
 And I think for us, you know, maybe you don't have a partner, but we have a community to

596
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,800
 encourage us, to remind us of what God has said.

597
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,600
 To hold on to those truths.

598
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
 Right?

599
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,880
 To then say, "Okay.

600
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,480
 Yes, all these things are worrying.

601
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
 Things are uncertain.

602
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,640
 I might not have enough to pay rent, but this is what God has said.

603
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,880
 Let's hold on.

604
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
 Let's trust."

605
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:20,080
 And, you know, one other thing is the knowing that I know.

606
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,000
 I have heard God speak before.

607
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,920
 I know that God speaks.

608
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,720
 These are biblical truths that are in my life and in our lives.

609
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
 Right?

610
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,960
 It's a foundation of our faith.

611
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,320
 And that in this time that we can hold on to that, that he does not leave us.

612
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,920
 He does not forsake us.

613
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
 Right?

614
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,440
 These are things that we know that are true.

615
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,600
 And as we hold on to them, we can take courage.

616
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,680
 We can be encouraged.

617
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:54,560
 So fast forward to June when it was actually time to start praying about our future.

618
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,400
 It was honestly such a great process.

619
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,640
 We took some time to debrief.

620
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:11,120
 And in that time, we slowly started praying more, talking to people, talking to mentors,

621
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,160
 people that we trust.

622
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,800
 Okay, this is the time we felt like the doors are open.

623
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,840
 What do you have for us, God?

624
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,920
 And it was perfect.

625
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,360
 God slowly spoke.

626
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:31,560
 God showed us different things that we were supposed to do, what was on his heart.

627
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:37,120
 And we slowly gained direction, you know, purpose once again.

628
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
 Right?

629
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:44,160
 So for me, you know, we just felt, at least for us, we felt like, oh, we're supposed to

630
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,200
 remain here in Hong Kong.

631
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,680
 That's what God has for us right now.

632
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,240
 We were supposed to serve more in this area, in Yuen Long.

633
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,080
 You know, we've lived here in the Yuen Long area for the whole time here in Hong Kong.

634
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,320
 You know, we've started to gain relationships.

635
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,880
 Honestly, started to finally gain traction with locals here, you know, in the village

636
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,880
 that we live in, and the people here in Hong Kong, the relationships that we build.

637
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,840
 And he's like, those things are important.

638
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,480
 It takes time to do that.

639
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,560
 Don't just let them go, you know, build on that.

640
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:31,960
 And I think when I look back now, I'm reminded, you know, that yes, God did speak in that

641
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:39,480
 first, before, when he said, in the first six months, just don't do anything.

642
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
 Don't talk about it.

643
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,600
 Because when it became time, he did speak.

644
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
 And it became more clear.

645
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:51,760
 I don't know if you can understand, right, that when there's silence, and then now that's

646
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,640
 the opposite of word, it became more clear of, okay, now I really know, that I really

647
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,520
 know that this is the direction that I'm supposed to do.

648
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,840
 And so I think when I look back in the whole year, I feel like I've learned to trust God

649
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:17,920
 more in this different way, right, that God does guide us.

650
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,640
 And sometimes we don't need to keep asking, is it this one?

651
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
 How about this one?

652
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:29,240
 Right, if he said something, and it's been clear, let's just remember that.

653
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,880
 And have that people next to us to encourage us, hey, don't worry about that.

654
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,240
 God will make it good in his time.

655
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,800
 This is what he has already said.

656
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
 Don't forget that.

657
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
 Hold firm.

658
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:50,080
 And maybe that's a little bit of reflection of one's maturity in Christ as well.

659
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:59,760
 And maybe that's reflected in Hebrews 5, when God says, the writers say, you should be seeking

660
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,440
 food and eating food instead of drinking milk, like what you're supposed to receive now.

661
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:15,320
 And I think I like to say that I've matured in my faith a little bit more in this season

662
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:21,680
 in regards to receiving direction, in regards to hearing from God.

663
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,920
 And it comes with practice, right?

664
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,200
 I think hearing God's voice is something that as you practice more, you're more attuned

665
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
 to.

666
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,160
 So I would encourage that as well.

667
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,280
 And God knows what we can handle.

668
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,660
 God knows where we're at.

669
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,240
 He knew I could handle the silence, even though in the midst of it, there are times there

670
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,640
 where just what is happening.

671
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,800
 But he knew that I could, because when I look back now, I did it, we did it.

672
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:03,360
 Would I say I would like it that way, moving forward, that God is silent more?

673
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,960
 I don't know.

674
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,080
 I don't know.

675
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:12,160
 But of course, God's never going to be permanently silent to us.

676
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,640
 That's it.

677
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,240
 God bless.

678
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,200
 Thank you so much, Matthias.

679
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,080
 I think a lot of times we praise God for his work, but then it's seldom to hear that to

680
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,680
 praise God because he's silent.

681
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,760
 And I think that's really important to trust him.

682
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,200
 And I think that refinement was really beautiful as well.

683
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,100
 So thank you so much for sharing.

684
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,640
 And last but not least, I'd like to invite Novia to come up to share with us.

685
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:45,080
 I first know Novia through Alpha, and today I'd like to invite her to come and share her

686
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,640
 journey in 2024 as well.

687
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,120
 Hello, everyone.

688
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,120
 My name is Novia.

689
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:01,860
 It was an honor for me to share my story between God and me with you.

690
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,080
 So here it goes.

691
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,560
 Two years ago, I suffered from anxiety issue.

692
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,080
 I felt very insecure and unconfident about life and future.

693
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,540
 I didn't know what was the purpose of life and was fearful at uncertainty in life.

694
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:22,600
 Every morning, I would spend 10 minutes lying in bed, feeling anxious and hopeless.

695
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,680
 Even though I believe in God, I tend to believe in human effort so I can make sure things

696
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,400
 were in control.

697
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,280
 I also find it hard and unrealistic to believe God's word in the Bible.

698
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,600
 Do not be anxious about anything.

699
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
 This is Hong Kong.

700
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,680
 How can you not be anxious about things in Hong Kong?

701
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,760
 Your career, finance, expectation from others, setbacks in life, aspiration that you cannot

702
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,920
 achieve, you name it.

703
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,760
 I bet every one of us encounter these problems in our lives.

704
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,840
 When I talked to my friend, Dorothy, about my fear, she brought me to the fine Yunlong

705
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,680
 and encouraged me to seek answer from God.

706
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,080
 God then brought me into a journey of healing and it was not easy.

707
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:13,360
 I still held on to my old habits of controlling things and didn't like God to lead me.

708
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,320
 My faith was weak.

709
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,080
 Fortunately, God is always faithful.

710
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:25,800
 Whenever I felt like giving up, God kept giving me signs that said, "I'm here and I know.

711
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,800
 Just don't give up yet."

712
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,160
 I slowly opened my heart to God and learned to trust Him.

713
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,840
 By listening to sermon every Sunday, I learned new perspectives from His words and I understood

714
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,800
 He wanted me to abandon fear.

715
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,280
 On some bad days when I didn't feel like going to church, He sent the Holy Spirit to urge

716
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,360
 me.

717
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,360
 And guess what?

718
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,320
 In those sermons, He spoke to me directly and those are the words that I needed most

719
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,400
 at that time.

720
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,800
 During that period of time, my favorite scripture was, "I can do all things through Christ who

721
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,280
 strengthens me."

722
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:08,080
 Whenever anxiety started to creep in, I declared this scripture in His name and as the identity

723
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,280
 of His daughter.

724
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:18,860
 By reading Bible and talking to Him every day, anxiety and worry started to fade away.

725
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:24,320
 In replacement, there was peace and the expectation that He would prepare for me.

726
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,400
 I felt true freedom in Him and my heart was finally at rest.

727
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,400
 Last month, my elder brother was admitted to hospital for a surgical biopsy.

728
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,800
 A tumor was found near my brother's lung and the doctor had to make a cut at his chest

729
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,680
 to obtain the tissue.

730
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,080
 The tissue would then be sent to test if it is abnormal.

731
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,560
 There may be a chance of cancer.

732
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,480
 Ever since I knew about this, I prayed to God and asked Him to give me strength to support

733
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,780
 my family.

734
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,700
 On the night before the surgery, my brother was deep in worry.

735
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,400
 The Holy Spirit led me to share with my brother my encounter with God.

736
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,880
 After I shared my story, my brother said, "He is real."

737
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,080
 Eventually my parents, my brother and I joined hands for prayer in the hospital.

738
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,840
 When we finished our prayer, my brother was in tears.

739
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:29,600
 My brother is now discharged from the hospital and there is nothing bad in him.

740
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,560
 Several days ago when I sent Christmas greetings in the family WhatsApp group, my mother said,

741
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,600
 "It was my daughter's God who made my son's surgery a successful one.

742
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,800
 Many thanks to Him."

743
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,160
 This experience had a great impact on me.

744
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,640
 One, instead of worrying like I usually did, God gave me peace and calmness to support

745
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,880
 my family.

746
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,720
 Two, He used me to touch the hearts of my family who are non-Christians, very traditional

747
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,640
 Chinese and only know Buddhism in their lives.

748
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,400
 Three, He refined me in a way a pessimist like me could also bring hope and comfort

749
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,880
 to others.

750
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,640
 When I look back on this journey, I think God intentionally led me into this situation

751
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,480
 so I needed to seek change.

752
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,880
 In response, God worked like a farmer in me.

753
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,560
 He took out the barren soil in me, fertilized and watered my heart with His words, gave

754
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,640
 me sunshine when I was in darkness.

755
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,960
 There is only one hope, one purpose.

756
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,400
 It is to grow good things in me.

757
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,080
 In the past, if God told me, "That will be a difficult journey for you," and I definitely

758
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,080
 would say, "No, I'll pass."

759
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:52,060
 But now, I'm forever thankful that God let me have this lesson which led me to joy, freedom,

760
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,720
 and hope.

761
00:45:53,720 --> 00:46:01,360
 I am no longer a slave to fear.

762
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,360
 To wrap up, I would like to share an extract of a song that best describes my journey.

763
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,840
 I brought it up in a desperate prayer.

764
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,720
 "Lord, why are you keeping me here?"

765
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,600
 Then He said to me, "Child, I'm planting seeds.

766
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:21,600
 I'm a good God and I have a good plan, so trust that I'm holding a watering can.

767
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,720
 And someday you'll see the flowers grow in the valley.

768
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,760
 When I'm on the mountain and looking down below, I'll see a valley of flowers that need

769
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,480
 the time to grow.

770
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,120
 And I thank you for the rain, the hurt, and days of pain."

771
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,040
 May God continue to bless and heal you in 2025.

772
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,040
 Thank you.

773
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,680
 Thank you so much.

774
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,840
 Thank you so much, Novia.

775
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,200
 Thank you for your courage to share about something difficult.

776
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:55,600
 Thank you for opening up the hearts to let people in to see what the journey is like.

777
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,440
 It's not easy to feel like this every single day.

778
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,560
 It's not easy to have to overcome fear, overcome challenging times.

779
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:10,760
 But as we have been hearing about God working in different people's lives in different ways,

780
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,680
 God is doing that the same for you today, that He is not stopping, but maybe it would

781
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,400
 look different for you.

782
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:24,440
 And so let's sit and think about what 2024 has looked like for you.

783
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:31,840
 We're going to have a time of quietness, and I'd like to invite you to look at your 2024.

784
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,440
 How has God been involved in your life?

785
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,120
 What has He done?

786
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:44,200
 Maybe it didn't look like what was shared on the stage, but I'm sure as we reflect,

787
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:52,480
 to see, and to consider, you can find God's footprint in every single step of your way.

798
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:40,600
 Maybe 2024 has been a really good year for you, that you sense God's direct grace and

799
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,680
 favor upon your life, and we want to celebrate that.

800
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,120
 Maybe your 2024 looks difficult.

801
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:54,440
 Maybe there are some hiccups along the way, but God is in it.

802
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,200
 God was there in Francesca's life.

803
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:06,160
 He moved hearts and people and helped Francesca to see what God is doing in their family and

804
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:13,740
 helped her to have a genuine curiosity to her uncle, her family member.

805
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:17,200
 Maybe there were a lot of waiting for you in 2024.

806
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:24,840
 Maybe you were opened up with many directions and you feel confused and you feel lost, but

807
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:30,920
 Matthias reminded us that God is in his life.

808
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:36,680
 His silence was actually a way to mature him.

809
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:47,760
 And Matthias at the end celebrated the silence, God's silence, to mature him.

810
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,880
 Maybe there were times when you feel anxious and you feel there's no way to handle all

811
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,360
 the different situations, just like what Novia has been sharing.

812
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:04,600
 But God was working in her life and her family's life.

813
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:11,400
 And when we hold on to God's word, when we gather people around us, we can overcome,

814
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,760
 not because we can, but because God is moving, God is working.

815
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:24,520
 And as we are looking ahead in 2025, I would like you to stretch out your hands to receive

816
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,320
 the gift that God is giving you.

817
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,080
 God is giving you wisdom.

818
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,520
 God is giving you grace and open doors.

819
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:41,760
 God is giving you his precious son, Jesus, in you, surrounding you with people.

820
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:49,520
 We often feel like a new year is uncertain, but what we can hold on to, the certainty

821
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:58,720
 that we can hold on to is Jesus in our lives doing this with us.

822
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:06,720
 And hold on church, hold on to God's word, hold on to what he has said.

823
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,520
 He is for you.

824
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,800
 He is in you.

825
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,160
 Let's all stand up and respond to him in a way that only our voices can.

826
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,740
 (gentle music)
