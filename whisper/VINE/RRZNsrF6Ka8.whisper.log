[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   In Jesus' name, amen, amen, amen.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:13.780]   Church, good afternoon, good afternoon.
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.560]   All right, let's dive in.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.080]   Today, we're gonna be looking at the next section
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.280]   in this season of Uncharted that we are stepping into
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.800]   in our current, we're not just stepping into it,
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.300]   we're kind of in it now, right?
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.040]   It's not just a vision or a thing for the future,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.920]   but we really believe that through what God is doing
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.200]   and the worship experiences we're having,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.280]   the times of prayer, the time of teaching
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.000]   is really helping prepare us, it's equipping us,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.640]   it's giving us what we need to be able
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.340]   to walk faithfully into these seasons
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.840]   that are uncharted, knowing that He is with us
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.840]   and that He is good.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.600]   So I'll start off like this.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.680]   Did you know that there are 27 books in our New Testament?
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.680]   Of those 27 books, about half of them have the same author.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.180]   One guy I like to write a lot.
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.080]   This guy's name is Paul, right?
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.120]   Paul wrote about 13 to 14 books in the New Testament.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.320]   Paul is what you call a super Christian.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.440]   He has lots of accomplishments.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.440]   He's done some pretty great things.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.560]   What he would do in his writing to these churches
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.300]   that he helped establish and build and strengthen,
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.640]   some that he founded would be encouragement.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.160]   He would give them words through the power
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.040]   of the Holy Spirit, writing these letters
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.720]   to edify, to help grow and flourish these communities.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.080]   Even here at the Vine, we're on that train.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.080]   Did you know that our vision comes from
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.200]   one of Paul's letters?
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.760]   Does anyone know what letter it comes from?
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.360]   This would be nice, some fun trivia.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.100]   Who knows what letter does the vision at the Vine come from?
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.120]   Ooh, crickets.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.120]   Come on, 2 p.m.?
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.020]   I believe in y'all.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.480]   Ooh, now don't get it wrong.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.720]   (laughing)
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.480]   Which book is it?
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.240]   Ephesians, the book of Ephesians.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.160]   Paul writes this letter to the church in Ephesus.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.220]   So let me read you this prayer that he prays,
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.000]   which we have built our vision on here at the Vine.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.380]   He prays this, that we would grasp how wide and how high,
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.840]   how long, how deep is the love of Christ,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.600]   and that we would know this love
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.700]   would surpass this knowledge.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.760]   And this is the part where we get our statement from,
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.120]   that you would be filled to the measure
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.600]   of all the fullness of God.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.640]   Talk about some encouraging words.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.440]   Growing big people filled to the measure
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.420]   of all the fullness, all of the fullness of God.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.120]   Paul is a key figure in the New Testament.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.520]   He actually, one of the major things that he does
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.640]   is he is this agent of bringing the Gentiles,
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.120]   who are non-ethnically Jewish people,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.280]   who are not under the promises and the inheritance
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.440]   of a Jewish God, bringing them into the family of God,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.960]   showing that Jesus was for all people,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.920]   not just one specific demographic.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.640]   Authors would say that Paul was like a mediator,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.520]   establishing a unified community
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.600]   between the Gentiles and the Jewish Christians.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   If you've been in church for any amount of time,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.720]   you could probably play bingo with some of the letters
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.400]   and some of the quotes that Paul has, right?
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.600]   So we're gonna play a simple game.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.360]   Raise your hand if you know this one, okay?
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.760]   So let's test it, make sure you're awake.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.480]   Show me how you raise your hand.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.120]   Hey, about half of you, good, good, good.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.560]   Maybe the other half will catch on.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.640]   So how many of you are familiar
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.400]   with the fruit of the spirit?
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.680]   Love, joy, peace, patience.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.800]   Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.120]   Okay, you've heard that one before.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.960]   All right, hands down.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.040]   What about like the armor of God, right?
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.520]   Okay, cool, some of you are good.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.640]   What about this one?
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.380]   If you're married or if you've ever been to a wedding,
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.000]   you probably, you don't have to be a Christian,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.160]   you probably know this one.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.520]   Love is patient, love is kind.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.560]   Love does all these nice things.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.160]   Anyone heard that one before?
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.000]   All right, last one.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.420]   This is a two o'clock, so I believe
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.720]   there might be someone in here
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.860]   with this very verse tattooed on their body.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.440]   If it's you, it's okay, all right?
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.920]   Paul's writings are so good.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.080]   He says this one, I mean, and I'm from the US,
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.160]   I'm gonna give American reference.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.460]   There's a football player who put it on their face
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.480]   because it was so impactful.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.160]   I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me,
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.460]   right, we know that one as well.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.320]   These are all some of the words that Paul had penned
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.960]   through the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.800]   to help grow and edify the church.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.560]   Paul is a big, important figure.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.720]   But not only does he write catchy Bible verses,
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.940]   he also goes on these trips,
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.840]   on these specifically three missionary journeys
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.000]   all across the Roman Empire to help build churches,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.280]   to help start churches, to help speak life
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.560]   to some of these leaders, to ultimately bring
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.160]   the good news of the gospel across the Roman Empire.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.440]   And in that process, he gets shipwrecked,
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.720]   he gets bitten by snakes, he gets stoned,
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.060]   people are chasing him out of the town.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.600]   He argues with the Greeks in order to show them
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.000]   that all of their wisdom and knowledge
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.020]   is pointing to the wrong things.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.880]   He is adamant about helping people see who Jesus really is.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.760]   Across his lifetime, this is some of the stuff
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.200]   that you get out of Paul.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.080]   And ultimately, he is killed for his faith.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.600]   But the perspective that he held, man, it's interesting.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.440]   He would say, he compares, he would compare
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.120]   to the joy that is coming, the pain that he feels now
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.600]   and the hardship he feels now, it's okay.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.800]   He's not saying that it's not hard,
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.000]   he's saying compared to the joy that's coming,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.400]   this guy had a good perspective.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.280]   He would say things like, I count everything else
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.280]   that I have as lost compared to knowing Jesus.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.600]   Like this is like a hero, man, like I wanna be able
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.320]   to live and talk like this and be like this.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.880]   This is the Paul that we have.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.880]   But here's the thing, Paul was not always this way.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.800]   Paul had a past, right?
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.080]   Paul had some stuff he did in the past
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.040]   that was pretty shady and dodgy, right?
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.600]   We talk about how Paul is known for these incredible feats
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.160]   of accomplishment within the Christian space.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.180]   However, at some point, Paul was Saul
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.360]   and he was the antithesis of everything he's famous for now.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.000]   He was against the Jesus movement.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.640]   Yeah, no, he wanted to end it.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.480]   His purpose and his goal was to eradicate
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.980]   the followers of Jesus, to remove them from here.
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.100]   Talk about a complete 180.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.280]   That was a little throw to you guys, 180.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.560]   You're welcome, you're welcome, I saved that just for you.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.520]   His transformation story is pretty well known,
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.040]   but let me just give us a quick little recap.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.880]   He gets permission from the chief priest to go to Damascus.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.340]   So he's in Jerusalem, he gets permission to leave Jerusalem,
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.800]   go to another part of town, go to another city,
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.000]   and to go and gather the Christians
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.120]   and bring them back for trialing in Jerusalem.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.840]   So he's on his way with all the authority,
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.000]   with all the papers he needs,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.640]   and all of a sudden, his light from heaven flashes down
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.680]   and Saul is knocked off of his horse.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.840]   And standing before him is Jesus in this bright light.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.960]   Jesus is standing face to face.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.540]   I mean, imagine, like if you've been doing things right,
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.360]   seeing Jesus face to face would be scary.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.680]   If you've been persecuting him,
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.820]   probably terrifying, right?
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.380]   So terrifying that Saul ends up losing his vision.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.380]   Jesus asked him, "Why are you persecuting me, Saul?"
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.620]   I love that small detail.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.140]   He doesn't say, "Why are you persecuting my people?"
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.340]   He says, "Why are you persecuting me?"
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.340]   He identifies himself with the sufferings of his people.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.260]   And Saul would have this moment where he is just awestruck.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.660]   He's seen Jesus and Jesus has spoken to him,
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.020]   and now he leaves blind, perhaps one of the most impactful,
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.940]   powerful men, now in this extremely vulnerable state
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.760]   where he can't even walk by himself.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.120]   And it's within this space
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.600]   that we get introduced to another person.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.160]   This transformation that God is starting in Saul
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.660]   is not complete.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.000]   God brings someone else in,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.600]   someone that we know very little about,
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.960]   some small potato kind of person
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.860]   who didn't write 15 books of the New Testament,
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.100]   who doesn't have all the quotable lines,
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.500]   someone that probably no one knows who they are, right?
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.880]   This is where we're introduced to a guy named Ananias.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.420]   Raise your hand if you've ever heard of the name Ananias.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.360]   Like six people.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.200]   Okay, cool.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.460]   Okay, some of you guys do.
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.840]   That's good.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.800]   Ananias is not a popular figure.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.940]   No one really knows who he is.
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.780]   Very little is known about him.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.120]   But this is where we get introduced to him,
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.040]   and it's in this context of persecution.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.420]   As Pastor Andrew talked about last week,
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.200]   persecution which broke out in the first century church.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.520]   The way they spoke about Saul
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.320]   was that he was breathing murderous threats
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.160]   against the church,
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.880]   dragging men and women out of their houses.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.200]   This is the space where we get to see
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.160]   a ridiculous transformation,
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.360]   a transformation which requires sacrifice,
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.860]   which requires cost,
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.880]   which makes people weigh what it is
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.520]   that they truly believe.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.400]   So I'm gonna take us to the Bible,
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.400]   if you have your Bible with you.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.960]   This is what a Bible looks like.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.020]   Old school Bible.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.300]   We're gonna read through it today.
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.080]   Let me just pull it out.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.200]   Looking at Acts chapter nine,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.840]   starting at verse 10.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.200]   If you don't physically have a Bible with you,
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.840]   it's okay, we don't shame you here.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.520]   There will be scripture on the screen,
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.280]   you can read there.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.100]   This is what happens.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.280]   In Damascus, there was a disciple named Ananias.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.440]   The Lord called to him in a vision,
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.120]   "Ananias."
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.960]   "Yes, Lord," he answered.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.280]   The Lord told him, "Go to the house of Judas
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.240]   on Straight Street and ask for a man
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.760]   from Tarsus named Saul,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.360]   for he is praying.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.000]   In a vision, he has seen a man named Ananias come
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.920]   and place his hands on him to restore his sight."
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.180]   "Lord," Ananias answered,
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.880]   "I have heard many reports about this man
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.580]   and all the harm he has done
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.440]   to your holy people in Jerusalem.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.720]   And he has come here with authority
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.480]   from the chief priests to arrest all
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.400]   who call on your name.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.680]   But the Lord said to Ananias,
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.720]   "Go, this man is my chosen instrument
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.240]   to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.880]   and to the people of Israel.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.040]   I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.020]   So Ananias went up to the house and entered it,
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.480]   placing his hands on Saul.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.000]   He said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.720]   on the road as you were coming here,
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.600]   he has sent me so that you may see again
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.280]   And immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.680]   and he could see again.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.600]   He got up and he was baptized.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.240]   And after taking some food, he regained his strength.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.720]   Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.520]   At once, he began to preach in the synagogues
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.600]   that Jesus is the son of God.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.080]   And all those who heard him were astonished.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.320]   And they asked, "Isn't he the man
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.880]   who raised havoc in Jerusalem
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.920]   among those who call on this name?
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.360]   And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.680]   to the chief priests?"
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.280]   Yet Saul grew more and more powerful.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.160]   And he baffled the Jews living in Damascus
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.600]   by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.640]   Why don't you pray with me?
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.520]   Jesus, we ask this afternoon that as we open your word
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.560]   and as we sit with it, Holy Spirit,
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.880]   that you would give us understanding.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.280]   It wouldn't just be good information,
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.480]   some fun facts and a cool story, God,
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.640]   but we know that life comes from your word.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.560]   You speak to us through this.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.960]   And so we ask right now that you would open our hearts,
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.440]   that it would be fertile ground to hear from you
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.680]   what you have to say.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.400]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.920]   So this is Ananias' guy.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.320]   He is part of the transformation of Saul.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.000]   But as you can see, we know very little about Ananias.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.800]   Very little is documented in his moment
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.760]   in the scriptures.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.520]   While living under persecution,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.840]   Ananias is called into the known.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.680]   Right now, this should make you be, "What?"
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.400]   Say, "Hold on, this whole sermon series
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.320]   is called the uncharted, right?
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.720]   So not the known, but the uncharted, the unknown."
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.920]   But there's something about what Ananias is stepping into.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.200]   There are some elements that are known to him.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   The reputation of Saul, for instance, is well known to him.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.840]   The risk, the danger that he'll be putting himself in
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.520]   is well known to him.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.960]   This would be uncharted with some elements that are known.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.800]   A risky decision.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.600]   Ananias would have to decide where he stands.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.280]   A call to the uncharted where Ananias is going to have
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.600]   to weigh his options, consider his beliefs,
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.160]   and where his trust really is.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.040]   Where Ananias is gonna have to ask himself,
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.440]   "What does he follow?
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.280]   What is he obedient to?"
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.000]   Or if his beliefs in Jesus boil down
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.040]   to an accumulation of information on Jesus.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.880]   This is part of the uncharted space
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.280]   that we all step into as well.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.920]   Where it's not just gonna be, "How well do we know stories?"
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.120]   It's gonna be a space where we're gonna be questioning,
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.960]   wondering, "Where do we really trust?
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.720]   Where is our actual trust?
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.640]   Where is our actual obedience?
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.040]   How do we step into these situations
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.000]   when the risk is clear
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.280]   and the odds don't look very favorable?"
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.480]   If this hasn't been your situation yet,
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.560]   it will be at some point.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.920]   And in those moments, we have to ask ourselves,
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.800]   knowing that there's difficulty ahead,
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.280]   will we still follow him into uncharted spaces?
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.280]   That's the question.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.760]   Knowing that there's a great risk and a great price to pay,
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.120]   will we continue to lean in?
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.240]   Will we continue to follow?
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.680]   Will we step in to those uncharted spaces
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.600]   or will we step out?
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.000]   Will we opt out?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.160]   When we know that it's gonna cost us a lot,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.360]   it's gonna require a lot,
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.720]   pushing us way out of our comfort zones,
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.640]   maybe not even necessarily being safe.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.840]   At that point, we have a question to ask us.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.320]   If you were here last week, Pastor Andrew, great sermon.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.040]   If you haven't listened to it, listen to it.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.760]   But he talked about persecution.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.240]   And I want to remind us of something that he said,
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.960]   because yes, it sets the stage for persecution
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.080]   and how we approach it,
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.200]   but also impacts some of these decisions
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.480]   that we're gonna have to wrestle with.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.840]   He said this, "When putting Christ first
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.580]   "comes with great personal cost,
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.720]   "we are tempted to choose what is safe
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.400]   "rather than obedience to him."
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.600]   This is the very position
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.720]   that Ananias would have found himself in.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.320]   God extends an invitation into a crazy moment,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.560]   into something that's never been done before,
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.680]   into a space where he would have to
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.240]   have total dependency on God.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.920]   Because the rumors of Saul,
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.680]   the reputations of his imprisonments
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.240]   and his killing and his persecution,
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.640]   he was notorious for being efficient at what he did.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.440]   Saul was a really good persecutor of the Christians.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.840]   And it's against this backdrop that God invites Ananias.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.520]   I find the way that Luke tells this story
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.800]   to be very revealing.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.800]   There's so many things he could have said,
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.400]   but actually he doesn't say a lot
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.320]   when it comes to Ananias.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.720]   He doesn't give us a lot of details on who Ananias is.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.880]   He gives us one specific detail regarding who Ananias is,
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.480]   and it's not his background, his age, his occupation,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.280]   not his family, not his status,
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.480]   not how many services he went to on a Sunday,
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.080]   not what church he attended, some of that stuff.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.880]   The one detail he gives us on Ananias
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.320]   ends up being perhaps the most critical
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.960]   thing about Ananias.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:51.040]   He reveals the essence of Ananias' identity.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.440]   And what is that identity?
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.040]   Well, that identity is going to be what shapes
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.560]   the way Ananias approaches how to follow Jesus
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.160]   into uncharted territories.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.480]   It's going to be what he uses to make his decisions,
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.320]   to weigh his options.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.720]   It's gonna be from that position of his identity
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.440]   that he is going to have a rationalized way
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.720]   of weighing his options and his risk ahead of him.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.480]   If we go back to the text, it says this.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.480]   In Damascus, there was a disciple named Ananias.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.760]   The key word here is disciple.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.560]   Luke deems that it's only detail that's worth noting,
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.200]   or perhaps better put, it's the only thing
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.120]   that tells us everything we need to know
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.240]   about who Ananias is, and that is that he is
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.440]   a disciple of Jesus.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.860]   And the word disciple is a very common word
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.800]   in the New Testament.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.600]   Across the first five books of our scriptures,
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.640]   the Gospels and Acts, the word disciple,
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.880]   it shows up 261 times.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.080]   It's talked about a lot.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.300]   A disciple simply means this, one who follows.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.560]   A disciple is one who follows.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.200]   I remember being younger and being told
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.000]   or given the example of the game Follow the Leader.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.160]   Has anyone played that before?
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.560]   It wasn't that great of a game, but it was a game.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.800]   It's kind of a terrible game, whatever.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.840]   Follow the leader.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.800]   One person goes and your only objective is to follow them.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.880]   So if the leader goes over here, you go over here.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.000]   If the leader goes to the upper house,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.840]   you go to the upper house.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.600]   If the leader goes out the exit, you go out the exit.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.720]   That is the whole premise of the game.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.340]   Discipleship is very similar to that concept.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.640]   Wherever Jesus goes, whatever Jesus does, we follow him.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.540]   When you think back to the first call
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.600]   of the disciples in Matthew, what does Jesus say?
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.080]   He doesn't say go get a very, very thorough education
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.400]   and come back.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.480]   He doesn't say have all your things together.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.480]   He doesn't say quote every scripture noticeable.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.400]   He says come and follow me.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.800]   This is the essence of what it means to be a disciple,
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   to follow Jesus, living and responding in adherence to him.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.800]   So then a disciple of Jesus is someone who does this,
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.780]   who follows Jesus in his belief patterns,
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.600]   who follows Jesus in Jesus' ideological leanings,
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.520]   in his practice, in his behavior.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.960]   The follower of Jesus prioritizes Jesus
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.600]   in their preferences, in their decision-making processes,
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.400]   in their posture towards society and culture.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.120]   This is what a disciple does.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.400]   They pretty much just imitate what Jesus did.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.960]   They follow in his footsteps.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.160]   So therefore, as a disciple of Jesus,
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.040]   Ananias lives a certain way in response to who Jesus was,
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.680]   to what Jesus had shown.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.320]   And Ananias has decided that Christ was enough,
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.200]   that Christ was everything, Christ was it.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.000]   Therefore, it didn't matter what was gonna happen.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.840]   He was going to follow Jesus.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.920]   So when God calls Ananias in this book
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.400]   into a challenging situation,
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.320]   it's from this posture and this position
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.680]   of being a disciple of Jesus
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.780]   that Ananias is able to step into the unknown,
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.680]   step into the uncharted,
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.080]   step into the wild challenges that are gonna be ahead of him
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.800]   in this experience with Saul.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.440]   Because Luke identifies Ananias as a disciple,
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.920]   it gives us a little bit of a foreshadowing.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.960]   We should be able to recognize and know
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.800]   that if he's a disciple of Jesus,
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.820]   that means whatever he's called to do,
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.160]   if it's where Jesus would have went, it's what he will do.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.520]   If Jesus calls him to go here, he'll go there.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.280]   That's just the nature of what a disciple is.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.640]   However, in our discipleship, I wanna be clear,
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.160]   we have choices, Ananias had a choice.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.760]   Because it's not so simple as just like,
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.000]   follow what Jesus does
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.680]   when there's other players in the game, right?
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.880]   It's not like it's just me and Jesus and that's it.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.520]   There's no like other temptation or no other resistance
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.960]   and nothing else to push me away.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.120]   No, actually, there's quite a bit of other things
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.280]   that he could follow, right?
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.980]   In this season of uncharted for us,
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.760]   we have to recognize that it's not just us and Jesus,
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.720]   that there's other voices, other variables,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.400]   other players in the game, so to speak.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.480]   In these moments, we can find ourselves
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.160]   if we're not careful, following circumstances,
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.400]   thinking that we're following Jesus.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.980]   Following our observation and the results
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.640]   of what we've observed,
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.440]   thinking that we're following Jesus, right?
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.620]   Like if Jesus is leading us to green pastures,
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.720]   like it talks about in Psalm 23, we're happy,
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   we're sprinting towards the green pastures,
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.280]   towards the comfort of the green pastures,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.520]   towards the water and the stillness
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.960]   and the restoration of our soul.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.560]   Easy to follow Jesus then,
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.720]   but then at the same, Jesus that we follow
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.400]   leads us out of green pastures
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.160]   and into the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.920]   And as soon as he leads us there,
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.680]   if we're honest, it gets a little bit,
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.040]   not so quick to run into that with him, are we?
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.200]   I think just that little analysis shows us
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.080]   that we have to be careful not to follow the situation
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.160]   or the circumstance while thinking
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.200]   that we're following Jesus.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.120]   And Ananias would have been in this exact same position,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.440]   right, he's following Jesus into a conversation,
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.040]   into an encounter with a murderous man
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.280]   who has full authority,
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.880]   who has come into his city for people like him.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.080]   He is going into the most dangerous position
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.400]   he's been in yet.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.800]   This is what it would mean for him to follow Jesus.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.960]   And we're gonna find ourselves at this crossroads
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.240]   where we're gonna have to ask ourselves,
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.000]   are we gonna follow observation?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.260]   Are we gonna hesitate because it looks dangerous,
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.840]   because there's a price to pay?
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.020]   Are we only gonna follow Jesus
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.720]   when the situation looks good,
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.920]   when the circumstances look favorable,
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.560]   when we can observe it and come to the conclusion
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.620]   that it looks okay?
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.960]   Or are we risking not following Jesus at all?
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.000]   And I wanna be clear, so please don't get me wrong here.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.440]   I'm not saying that we can't have,
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.240]   that we can't use our powers of observation.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.080]   I'm not saying that for Ananias,
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.360]   he should have been like, oh, this is easy,
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.760]   ha ha ha, I'll just go.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.720]   Like no, he's human, it's actually dangerous.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.900]   It's factually a dangerous situation.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.920]   Our ability to observe isn't being removed
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.360]   because we're Christians.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.200]   Our ability to feel isn't being removed
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.040]   because we're Christian.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.880]   God's not asking you not to feel, he gave you feelings.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.960]   He's not asking you not to observe,
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.280]   he gave you the powers of the observation.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.020]   But he is saying that you won't always
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.160]   be able to follow them.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.580]   At some point, the way of our feelings
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.720]   and the way of Jesus will clash.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.260]   We can find ourselves on opposite ends,
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.280]   where Jesus is calling us and where we feel
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.140]   might end up being opposed one day.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.360]   And it's in those moments that we have to recognize
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.200]   that sometimes feelings are meant to be felt
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.220]   and not followed.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.320]   When things appear one way, we have to know
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.600]   that God isn't calling us to follow the appearance.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.960]   Uncharted is an invitation to lean
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.500]   not on our own understanding, but to lean on him.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.480]   And the heavy reality is that we are at risk
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.520]   of not actually following Jesus,
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.480]   but following circumstances.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.960]   And I know for all of us here,
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.800]   we're here because we want to follow Jesus, right?
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.320]   We want to be a disciple, we want to follow him well,
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.080]   but the temptation is so subtle.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.920]   It can be so easy to find ourselves slightly off course,
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.040]   following the wrong thing,
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.800]   responding and making decisions out of fear
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.280]   or out of what we observe
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.040]   versus off of where God is calling us to go.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.520]   I mean, think about Ananias for a second here.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.640]   If we look back at verse 13,
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.160]   look at what he is tempted, how he responds.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.300]   He says, "Lord," Ananias answered,
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.520]   "I have heard many reports about this man
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.840]   "and all the harm he has done to your holy people
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.680]   "in Jerusalem.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.380]   "He even has the authority from the chief priests
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.480]   "to arrest anyone who calls on your name."
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.160]   Ananias is observing, he's aware,
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.620]   he's counting the costs.
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.720]   He's recognizing that this is gonna be challenging.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.300]   "Lord, this is a hard thing.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.620]   "Are you aware of it?"
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.440]   Saul is notorious for killing.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.960]   Saul has all the equipment and all what's necessary
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.640]   to arrest me and take me back.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.880]   He's been given authority.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.360]   "Lord, this man, I've heard about him.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.620]   "Everything Ananias says," check this,
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.760]   "everything he says in his response is true.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.100]   "Every feeling he's feeling, it's true.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.380]   "He's not wrong anywhere here.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.000]   "Yet there's a difference in acknowledging
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.860]   "the difficulties ahead and responding by following them."
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.480]   There's a difference in recognizing
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.980]   that it's gonna be hard versus saying,
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.020]   "Hold on, Jesus, maybe I can't do that."
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.400]   Ananias is faced with this exact same thing.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.300]   Uncharted is this, it's not an invitation
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.800]   into favorable circumstances.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.920]   It's an invitation to follow the sovereign Jesus
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.880]   who has victory over both the favorable
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.400]   and the unfavorable circumstances.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.560]   That make sense?
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.040]   Then I think we have to get our heads around this
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.080]   because I remember when Pastor Andrew shared it
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.280]   with the staff, what this whole uncharted vision was.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.200]   He talked about like a ship and we're going forward.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   And as we were brainstorming, in my mind,
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.600]   all I think about is like a ship going into fog,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.340]   having no idea what's coming.
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.280]   That's not necessarily a favorable circumstance
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.120]   or a situation.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.560]   And if we're expecting rainbows and butterflies
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.400]   and ease, honestly, we're gonna find ourselves
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.400]   hesitating to respond to Jesus
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.740]   when he calls us to sacrifice anything.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.180]   So we have to be able to get that picture clear.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.360]   Because Ananias is a disciple of Jesus,
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.660]   because he follows Christ alone,
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.180]   he's willing to take on the danger ahead of him.
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.020]   And when we follow Jesus alone,
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.280]   we too will be given the strength that we need
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.240]   to be able to step into uncharted seasons,
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.160]   into the known dangers, but with confidence
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.400]   because our sight and our eyes are fixed,
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.160]   not on the conditions ahead, but on the person,
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.320]   on Jesus, the victorious Jesus,
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.340]   who's overcome everything, all things,
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.800]   even the conditions of the journey ahead.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   The decisions that we are willing to make
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.440]   will show us what it is that we are following.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:21.080]   I find it fascinating, Ananias reminds God of Saul's CV.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.240]   His record.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.920]   He's like, God, you know the reputation here?
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.800]   This dude is good.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.760]   I've heard, not a few, I've heard many reports.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.640]   Lots of people are saying it, God,
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.960]   that this guy's dangerous.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.320]   This is a risk to me, God.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.720]   He's coming for people who are just like me.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.800]   He's left his town and come looking for me,
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.320]   and here I am being sent to him?
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.920]   That doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.160]   It's not very logical.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.280]   Why would you do that?
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.360]   I wonder if Ananias is like, God, did you get the wrong Saul?
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.040]   Did you mean like the other Saul?
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   Like the good guy Saul?
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.360]   The not so murderous Saul?
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:27:00.060]   It's in moments like this, we have to realize
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.680]   that there's a sacrifice involved in following Jesus.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.200]   Disciples of Jesus have to be willing to
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.000]   and will be required to sacrifice.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.880]   But how does God get us from the point,
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.680]   gets Ananias from the point where he's like,
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.560]   oh my goodness, have you heard of the rumors?
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.000]   Have you heard the many stories?
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.320]   Have you heard of his authority?
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.660]   How does God get Ananias from that to obedience?
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.880]   Look at what God says back to Ananias.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.720]   He says, "Go, this man is my chosen instrument
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   "to proclaim my name to the Gentiles
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.300]   "and their kings and to the people of Israel."
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.480]   Now, if you're tracking with this, you'll realize,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.960]   just like God, he actually doesn't address
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.400]   any of the concerns that Ananias just asked about.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.600]   Ananias is like, have you heard the stories, God?
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.360]   Do you know he's dangerous, God?
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.500]   Do you know he has authority, God?
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.760]   And God is like, go.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.580]   What?
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.040]   You're gonna answer my questions?
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.200]   No, he's like, go, go forward.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.360]   This man is this, this man is that.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.920]   Can we appreciate that God never assures Ananias
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.820]   of the outcome to him personally?
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:09.000]   All of Ananias' concerns are about how Saul could hurt him
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.360]   and the danger and the persecution that he can inflict
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.080]   and has been inflicting.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.960]   And when God answers him, he says, go.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.800]   This is what I'm going to do.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.600]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.360]   That God is about to require Ananias to sacrifice
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.200]   a couple of things, his comfort, his observation,
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.640]   his perspective, his control of what he thought
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.560]   his life would look like and how it would all play out.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.160]   It's wild to me because in order to get Ananias
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.360]   to be at that point of considering the cost,
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.400]   God does not assure Ananias.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.680]   He does not assure him he'll be okay.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.400]   And I'll be honest, that's what I would be looking for.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.240]   If God was like, promise, go put yourself
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.520]   in this real difficult situation that could lead
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.240]   to you being captured and taken away,
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.840]   I'd be like, all right, God, first of all,
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.680]   tell me I'll be all right.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.500]   Tell me I'm good.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.400]   Tell me nothing bad is going to happen to me.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.160]   Tell me my bank account will be okay.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.480]   Tell me that the persecution won't be too bad.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.600]   Tell me my family will be safe.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.800]   Tell me my life as I've ever always dreamed it
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.640]   and the things that I want for myself
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.560]   are still going to happen.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.280]   That would be the conditions, conditional faith,
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.880]   that I would have if I'm not proud of it.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.200]   That's my natural response.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.960]   We want that assurance.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.400]   And how many of us would be the same thing?
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.240]   Like, yes, God, I'll step into this uncharted season
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.360]   knowing that these difficulties lie ahead.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.000]   If you'll tell me, everything will be okay.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.240]   If you'll promise me I'll still stay safe,
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.680]   that there's no chance of failure,
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.080]   that nothing will go wrong,
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.600]   that my life as I expect it will carry on.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.120]   At that point, here's the question.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.520]   Is there any faith involved?
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.520]   Does the scripture tell us that without faith,
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.800]   it is impossible to please God?
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.440]   God does not give him the assurance.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.760]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.400]   God sees his desire for assurance
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.280]   and instead he chooses by answering and saying this.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.320]   He says, "This man Saul is my chosen instrument
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.040]   "to proclaim my name to the Gentiles
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.360]   "and to the world."
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.360]   God takes a man who's looking for assurance
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.840]   and instead shows him his purpose.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.400]   He says, "Consider the purpose, Ananias.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:27.280]   "See how I see Saul differently than you.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.520]   "That I see Saul as my vessel,
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.280]   "that I've actually chosen him.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.160]   "And I want him specifically to be the one
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.240]   "who takes my good news to the world.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.480]   "He takes my good news to the Gentiles
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.160]   "and to their kings and to Israel."
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:50.480]   Unifying Gentiles and grafting them into the family of God.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.200]   We, if you're here today and you're not Jewish,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.720]   you are a by-product.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.680]   Your faith, the fact that we can be in this
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.200]   is a by-product of what God was going to do with Saul.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.920]   God had massive plans for this guy.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.400]   See, the cost is often associated with the value.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.960]   This is just basic stuff for us, right?
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.200]   Cost is often associated with value.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.360]   God doesn't call us to sacrifice for no reason
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.120]   or simply because it's the religious thing to do.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.880]   No, the cost indicates that there's value
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.720]   on the other side.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.720]   So he shows Ananias the value by showing him the purpose.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:34.360]   And it does make me wonder how many of us,
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.200]   how many of our fears and our hesitations
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.480]   to respond to Jesus with a costly sacrifice
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.320]   needs to be seen from a place of his purposes
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.800]   rather than our assurance.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:53.960]   We can still feel the feelings,
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.840]   but would we be more willing to step into uncharted spaces
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.600]   knowing that God isn't randomly leading us there,
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.600]   but instead has valuable purposes planned?
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.840]   Because the cost is there because there's value.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.060]   God's not wasteful.
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.120]   So it's natural for us to ask, okay, cool,
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.400]   so what's the purpose, promise?
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.600]   For the challenges that are ahead of me,
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.480]   the things that I'm wrestling to step into obedience with,
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.480]   what's the purpose?
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.480]   Tell me the purpose so I can be like an Ananias
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.920]   and just go straight to Saul.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.200]   I must confess, actually,
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.680]   God doesn't tell us the purpose all the time.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.200]   He doesn't always give you the full rundown
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.400]   of this is how it leads to this,
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.440]   and here's how it connects,
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.760]   and here's how the church is gonna be born,
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.400]   and here's the mission trip that's gonna take place.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.000]   He doesn't show us all of that all the time.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.960]   Most times he's not gonna show us that.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.720]   No.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.480]   But to the believer, to the disciple,
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.120]   to the follower of Jesus, the call is enough.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.520]   Because if we know him,
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:59.400]   if we know his purposes in general,
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.240]   and when I say in general,
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.440]   I don't mean to water it down like,
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.680]   oh, they're not that specific.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.600]   In general, meaning his purposes for all of his creation,
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.740]   like the grandness, the size and scope of his purposes.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.440]   If we know that, it's to bring justice to the marginalized,
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.300]   it's to bring hope to the hopeless,
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.380]   it's to bring light where there is darkness,
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.560]   it's to bring restoration and to set captives free,
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.360]   to elevate the goodness of God,
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.480]   to bring truth to areas where there are lies.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.720]   If we recognize and remember his purposes,
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.160]   what will that do?
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.360]   If we remember his purposes,
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.960]   see, if we forget his purposes,
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.400]   it becomes nearly impossible to sacrifice.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.540]   If we think it's just a hard season,
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.600]   or it's just a really hard thing,
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.600]   and I don't know how to do it.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.080]   If we can't see that God is doing something bigger,
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.160]   it becomes nearly impossible for us to sacrifice.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.200]   Again, I'm gonna quote Andrew.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.200]   I feel like I'm plagiarizing, but it's okay.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.800]   He is here right in front of me,
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.380]   and he read this beforehand, so it's all right.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.880]   Last week, he said something about persecution
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.280]   that I thought was really good.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.240]   He talked about how one of the things we can do
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.520]   towards the end of his sermon,
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.480]   he talked about some of the things
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.320]   that we can do, some practical steps for us.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.600]   One of those things was deepening our roots, right?
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.400]   And one of the ways he said we can deepen our roots
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.400]   is if we got to know, became more familiar with God again.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.760]   So I'm gonna add to it.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.760]   So it's not full plagiarism.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.560]   It's just adaptation.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.640]   I would say that, yes, become more familiar with God again,
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.940]   but also become more familiar with God's purposes again,
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:38.840]   because we won't be willing to suffer for what we don't know,
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.100]   for what we do not love.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.160]   That's a crazy thing to suffer for anyways.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.660]   Who would do that?
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:52.400]   We've got to become familiar with his purposes again.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.280]   When we consider what his purposes are,
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.800]   what it really looks like for the kingdom of God
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.200]   to step into our city, into our families,
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.880]   into our workplaces, into our wider communities,
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.000]   the goodness and the faithfulness and the love of God
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.880]   to permeate the spaces that we're in.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.760]   If we can be reminded of that picture again,
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.400]   we remember that it's the waters that are uncharted.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.640]   It's the space that's uncharted, not God.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.520]   He's quite clearly revealed.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.400]   So there's no fear of uncharted waters.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.640]   That's too big because we know who God is,
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.640]   because he's been revealed,
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.200]   because his purposes have been revealed.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.880]   When we consider and remember his purposes,
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.600]   I pray that we see there's no cost that's too steep,
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.600]   because God is good, because his plans are good.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.120]   His ways are good.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.680]   His desire and his purposes for creation,
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.440]   for all of this is good.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.440]   Here at the Vine, when we consider the worthiness of God
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:59.680]   and his purposes, would it be enough to call us
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.560]   to a place of responding and costly sacrifice
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.200]   where we trust him?
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.080]   That we too would be so aligned
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.240]   with where God is taking the world,
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.720]   the goodness he is bringing, the restoration and the hope
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.200]   and the joy that he's bringing through his people,
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.560]   that we would be so in love with his vision for humanity
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.880]   and its flourishing, that we would say,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.080]   "No, we insist on paying a price.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.920]   "We insist on participating in what God is doing.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.360]   "We will not give sacrifices and offerings
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.320]   "and lives that cost us nothing."
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:37.720]   Because for Ananias, this was enough.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.680]   God shows him purpose,
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.640]   Ananias trusts God with his costly sacrifice.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.520]   And like we see, Paul ends up stepping into this world
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.400]   where he does immeasurably more than anyone could ever
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.200]   thought the Holy Spirit achieved so much
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.400]   through this one vessel.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.360]   And I feel like with Ananias,
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:03.360]   he could have never imagined the scope of the impact of Paul.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.960]   Could have never seen that from his one moment
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.240]   in conversation with God.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.720]   No, what he was faced with was simply a moment of examining
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.840]   where his trust really was.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.720]   The transformation of Saul to Paul
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.400]   would have not been a result of a sacrifice
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.360]   of only knowing things about God.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.720]   That's not what's required.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.200]   That's not what's asked for.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.480]   It's not about Bible trivia or perfect attendance
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.280]   or how many ministries you serve on.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:37.800]   The costly sacrifice God required of Ananias
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   and he requires of us is belief through obedience.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.920]   Costly sacrifices always lead us to examine
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.080]   where our trust really is.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.200]   We can say that we trust and love him
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.400]   until we're blue in the face,
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.640]   but until we live in obedience,
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.480]   responding until we choose to sacrifice, it's just words.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.760]   It's just information.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.000]   It's just knowledge
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.600]   in an already oversaturated information age.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.040]   The persecution comes for us all, but costly sacrifice,
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.400]   that's something you have to choose to do.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.680]   That's a decision you have to make.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.160]   That's a response you have to make.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.360]   And that's why we have to get to that place
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.000]   where our belief isn't simply information
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.360]   that we possess about God,
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.800]   but it's evidence through the choices that we make.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.400]   Our belief is evidence through the things we stand up for,
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.680]   the risk we're willing to take,
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:38.200]   the known spaces of danger and challenges
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.960]   that we're willing to walk into if Jesus leads us there.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.840]   The uncharted waters we're willing to follow Jesus into.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.800]   Disciples who trust in God must act upon that belief
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.160]   and trust that we possess.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.280]   James would say this in the New Testament,
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.020]   that our faith or that our deeds is dead,
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.500]   empty, meaningless, useless, does nothing.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.040]   We've got to be able to act in response
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.680]   to the belief that we possess.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.760]   As the band come up, I wanna read you this quote
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:12.440]   by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was just a brilliant mind.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.280]   He was too smart.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.880]   I can't, we've been reading his book together
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.160]   and I'm still stuck on chapter two
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.120]   and it's a really long book,
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.760]   but I can't like understand it enough.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.960]   His words are very big,
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.960]   but he actually really helps us get an understanding
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.780]   of what it means to be a disciple.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.000]   He says this, "With an abstract idea,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.400]   "it is possible to enter into a relation
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.640]   "of formal knowledge, to become enthusiastic about it,
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:38.300]   "and perhaps even to put it into practice,
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.280]   "but it can never be followed in personal obedience.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.140]   "Christianity without the living Christ
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.660]   "is inevitably Christianity without discipleship.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.020]   "And Christianity without discipleship
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.880]   "is always Christianity without Christ."
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.440]   So to follow, to be a disciple of Jesus
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.440]   in uncharted spaces and seasons,
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.040]   we have to be a people who more than just agree
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.360]   on the nice things that we find about Jesus in the Bible
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.160]   or the nice things that are there,
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.120]   but rather we have to choose the sacrifice
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.780]   of trusting Jesus, even when it costs us dearly.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:20.160]   My question to church is where is your trust today?
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.960]   What standards or perspectives do you adhere to?
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:30.660]   Do favorable and unfavorable circumstances
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.520]   make you risk adverse to hindering
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.380]   or hinders you following Jesus?
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:42.060]   Do we potentially lean too much on our own understanding,
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.660]   on our own observations, on our feelings?
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:50.900]   My prayer is this, that may Christ remind us all
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.380]   of his purposes, of his goodness,
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.660]   of just how much this world needs his kingdom
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.140]   and what those tenets of his kingdom truly are.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.340]   May we be reminded of his purposes,
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:06.100]   may we be reminded of his kingdom breaking into our spaces,
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.220]   into our city.
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.920]   May the purposes of God bring us joy.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:16.460]   May it brings us to a place where we're willing to trust,
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:22.340]   wherever he leads us, to offer up costly sacrifices,
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:26.540]   to offer up our bodies as a living sacrifice,
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.500]   holy and acceptable unto God,
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.160]   to offer all that we have, all that we are,
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.900]   in view of his goodness and in view of the mercies of God.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:41.160]   Let me pray for us, will you stand with me?
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:57.580]   Jesus, we thank you for your word and we ask Holy Spirit,
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.820]   well first we recognize Holy Spirit,
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.280]   the cost of discipleship is steep.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:09.020]   What it means to follow you is costly and sacrificial.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.340]   So Holy Spirit, would you begin to show us now
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.940]   if there are areas in our lives where
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.780]   we have been following comfort,
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.720]   we've been following prosperity,
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.580]   we've been following the easy road,
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.700]   we've been following our dreams,
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.780]   whether we've been following you.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.460]   If there's ways in which we've somehow mistaken
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.980]   following you for following favorable situations
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.660]   and circumstances, Holy Spirit,
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:34.600]   would you begin to separate the two?
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.560]   Would you begin to illuminate Jesus to us,
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.340]   make it clear who you are and what it means
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.020]   to follow you and you alone?
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:50.160]   God, would you make Jesus a priority to us?
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:55.060]   God, it's impossible to follow two things.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.220]   We either follow Jesus or we don't
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.380]   and God, I pray that your Holy Spirit
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:04.140]   would begin the work of reminding us
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.420]   of what it means to follow you.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.800]   God, I pray for all of us who step into these seasons
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.580]   where we have to weigh where our trust is.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.000]   We have to consider and count the cost of following you,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.700]   the cost of obedience.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:23.700]   God, I just pray for your help
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:27.900]   in choosing only you.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.700]   I pray that in these moments when the cost is high,
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.820]   that you would remind us of your purposes,
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:42.340]   that you would give us a vision for a flourishing humanity,
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.900]   even here in our city.
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.580]   You'd give us a vision for flourishing families,
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.520]   flourishing communities, flourishing relationships,
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:56.740]   for your ideals and what you are working this world towards,
