[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420]   Yeah, it's great to be with you.
[00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.120]   As you already heard today is Branches of Hope Sunday.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.360]   For those of you who do not know, Branches of Hope was actually started by the Vine Church.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.140]   So this nonprofit organization was started by the Vine.
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.220]   And so we're going to hear from them in a little bit excited about that.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.980]   Before we do that, I want to take a little bit time to prepare our hearts through God's
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.520]   word.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.640]   And hear from God through his word, what is on his heart for justice in society, so that
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.960]   we can align our hearts with that.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.240]   Does that sound good?
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.240]   Yes.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.320]   Okay, thank you.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.760]   So last week, we kicked off our God of Justice sermon series.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.960]   And in that series, we are in that message, we looked at the redemptive grand narrative
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.360]   of scripture.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.580]   And we saw that when we look at that narrative, that we can discover God's heart for justice.
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:11.220]   And we also said that it is this narrative that gives us the reason, the motivation,
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.880]   and the inspiration to carry out the vision of God's justice that he has for his people.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.520]   And to do that as individuals, but to also do that as a church family together.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.480]   And so when I, as I presented it, that narrative to you, we had some images.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.680]   So I want to take you to those images.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.600]   So here you see we were created for good.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.720]   So God created us, we looked at Genesis.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.760]   There was four relational contexts that we looked at, was about a relation between us
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.960]   and God, us and ourselves, us and others, us and creation.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.080]   And we said that everything was well, there was shalom, there was peace, and these relationships
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.960]   were flourishing and they were thriving.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.680]   But then something happened.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.280]   We said that sin entered the world, and there was a breakdown and all those four relationships,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.360]   we decided to rebel against God.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.400]   And this is repeated by every single human being, even to this point, that we rebel against
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.360]   God, there's self-preservation over helping others.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.560]   So we look out for ourselves first, and this is the default that we find ourselves in right
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560]   now.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.360]   And we looked at how these four relationships, how they're broken down, a relationship with
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.520]   God broke down, with ourselves, with others, and creation.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.200]   But then we said that God did not leave creation, he did not leave us in this mess.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.080]   Because that was not what he created us for.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.120]   And there's a longer story of redemption, but we said that it culminates in Jesus's
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.360]   coming.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.180]   That the righteous died for the unrighteous, for the wicked, for the sinners, which is
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.480]   all of us.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.440]   There's brokenness in our lives where we seek out what is good for us at the cost of other
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.920]   people.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.920]   And we sin against God, we sin against others, and we need Jesus to forgive us, to restore
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   us.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.280]   And so he came, he laid down his life so that we can become the kind of good that he desires
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.600]   for us, that we can become righteous and just people.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.300]   And so this relationship between us and God is restored.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.200]   But then with that, it is not just about us and Jesus.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.480]   That is the most important thing, but it's not just about that.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.840]   Being a Christian, being a person that believes in the gospel, it involves all four dimensions
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.240]   of this relational context.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.360]   Because God wants to restore all of them, and he wants us, his people, to be part of
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   it.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.520]   So we said that we were sent together to heal.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:59.080]   That the church of Jesus has been sent out by Jesus to bring healing into society, into
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.960]   all these facets.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.200]   So let me talk briefly about that.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.000]   We want to see relationships between people and God restored.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.680]   We want to help people find their way back to God.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.440]   We want to see relationships between people themselves restored, their identity, that
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.080]   they have peace even within themselves, which believe that God is the one who gives that.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.680]   We want to see relationship between us and creation restored, because instead of being
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.160]   rulers and having dominion over creation in a way that honors God, that reflects his
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.880]   character, we have exploited creation.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.480]   We have destroyed creation.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.080]   And God wants us to be good stewards.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.760]   He wants to restore that relationship so that we contribute to its flourishing, to its thriving.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.360]   And then finally, we also are sent out to restore relationships between each other,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.120]   between us and others.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.320]   And that happens on an individual level, like one-on-one, but also on a societal level where
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.120]   we want to see those relationships flourish and thrive.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.640]   We want to address injustices and issues where we make other people's issues our issues,
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.160]   because we want them to live out all of God's purposes and not be squished down by society,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.800]   by policies, by whatever else is going on, and so that all people can experience shalom
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.360]   and flourish and thrive.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.280]   And so that's what we're doing, where we are sent out as church to heal.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.600]   You know, God hasn't trusted us with this mission.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.000]   And so this is, you know, this is something that is super important.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.080]   And actually earlier, as Sherry was leading worship, I was thinking about this, you know,
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.120]   that this just happens not because we try harder.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   This is not homework.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.040]   No, you need to try harder.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:58.480]   This is because the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit moves within our hearts and leads us
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.280]   to love those around us.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.600]   And so if you're not feeling this right now, our starting point is just to pray, say, "Jesus,
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   I'm not feeling this right now.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.200]   Show me what is your will.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   Show me how to care.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.600]   Show me how to love.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.760]   Show me what you want to do.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.040]   You move me."
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.760]   And so my prayer for us as a church is that we are this church that does this.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:34.240]   But let me focus on what I want to briefly talk about, and that's the us and others today,
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.400]   particularly the injustices in society and God's heart for that.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.440]   And so we're going to go to the book of Isaiah.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.060]   Isaiah is one of the prophets in the Old Testament.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.060]   He confronts his people.
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.120]   So I'm going to set the context.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.720]   He confronted his people, God's people, Israel, who were set apart to be righteous and just,
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.760]   but they were failing in that.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.280]   So he confronts his people through the prophet, and he speaks into their lives, and he says
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.840]   some things that are quite disturbing.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   And he's God's mouthpiece.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.000]   So he's saying what God wants to say to his people.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.040]   He's saying that he does not take pleasure in their worship.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.200]   Their offerings are meaningless, and he hates it.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.560]   Whoa.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.120]   Can you imagine God saying that to us?
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   What's going on?
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.960]   You know, what's happening here?
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.840]   And that's what we're going to look at.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.880]   We're going to look at the reasons.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:38.880]   So the first year in Isaiah 1, 15 through 17, it says this, "When you spread out your
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.240]   hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.160]   Even when you offer many prayers, I'm not listening.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.880]   Your hands are full of blood."
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.040]   So we see, again, Israel is in this worship context, and God says, "I don't care about
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.040]   your prayers.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.040]   I'm not listening.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.560]   It doesn't matter how much you pray."
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:03.000]   But the reason is because their lives, their Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.920]   so forth, their lives does not honor God.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.560]   In their day-to-day actions, they're not giving God worship.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.460]   You know, they're living unrighteous lives.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.600]   And so God confronts them, and we're actually even told, we get a hint at what's going on.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.840]   We don't know all the details, but it says, "Your hands are full of blood."
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:32.440]   Now this, of course, can straight up mean murder, that they have blood on their hands,
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:40.040]   but it can also entail being indirectly involved in the injustices that are happening in society,
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.880]   that they're just focused on their own life, and they don't care what's going on with their
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.800]   neighbors and with other people.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.560]   And so God implicates them.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.920]   He says, "Your neighbors are also your responsibility.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.800]   It's not just about you and me.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.320]   It's also about you and me and others."
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:07.040]   And God calls out Israel for not caring for their neighbors, because that is part of what
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.480]   it means to be the people of God, is to be about others, and to care about the issues
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.440]   and the challenges they're facing.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.400]   And the same is true for us.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.880]   As Christians, our responsibility goes beyond looking after ourselves and extends to our
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.880]   neighbors.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.200]   It's not just me and Jesus, and that's it.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.880]   It's me and Jesus, and me and others.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.640]   Jesus cares about that we care about others in society.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.900]   They're also our responsibilities.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.640]   They're our brothers and our sisters, and we should care about what's going on in their
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.120]   lives and what injustices they face, because God cares about them.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.320]   And as His image bearers, He wants us to be people who reflect His image, who also care
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.360]   about those things that are going on.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.120]   And we also have agency, there's things that we can do.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.800]   Now for most of us, I think the challenge is that, for one, we're just busy, so we don't
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.120]   think about it.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.640]   And then our default is that we take care of ourselves, maybe our family, our friends,
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.880]   and we might even not know what's going on.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.200]   You know, what are the injustices and the issues right now in Hong Kong or in other
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.200]   countries?
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.180]   You know, what is going on?
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.120]   But God is saying, "This is our responsibility."
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.640]   And so then there's something that God does in verse 16, so let me continue.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.460]   He calls them, He says, "Wash and make yourself clean.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.440]   Take your evil deeds out of my sight.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.800]   Stop doing wrong."
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.560]   So in other words, He calls them to repent, to turn around, to change their ways, to stop
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:47.520]   doing what they're doing, to start caring for their neighbors, to start caring about
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.920]   the injustices in society.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.120]   And He calls them to turn around, so repentance always means that there's sorrow, that we
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.160]   realize there's conviction.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.680]   We say, "I'm sorry, God," but it's not just enough to say sorry and then keep doing what
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   you're doing.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.840]   It's actually changing our ways, changing our lives, and living in a different way.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.640]   And so He's saying, "Change the way you live."
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.040]   And then He tells them in verse 17, so we're going to look at that.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.320]   He tells them how He wants them to live.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:21.880]   And He says this, "Learn to do right, seek justice, defend oppressed, take up the cause
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.840]   of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow."
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.800]   And those are actually things that God does, what He's asking His people to do.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:38.240]   He does take up the cause, He does plead, He does defend, and He wants us, His people,
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.440]   to do the same thing.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.280]   Two things real quick that stood out to me.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.720]   First, learn to do right.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.200]   We don't actually automatically know what it means to do right.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.040]   It actually takes time to learn and understand what it means to do right in God's eyes.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.360]   That means we need to get to know His word, what God's word says about our neighbors.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.760]   It means we need to understand injustice issues in our society.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.200]   That means we learn from organizations that we're going to do from branches of hope.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.560]   It means we learn from people who are experiencing these injustices, that we actually understand
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.240]   them, that we can have compassion, that we can enter into them.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.400]   It means that we also can discern God's will, what His purpose is, and what it means to
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   administer justice.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.960]   And then, of course, we also need to learn how to defend, how to take up, and how to
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.960]   plead.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.960]   How do you do that in Hong Kong?
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.960]   And what does that look like?
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:39.040]   And the second thing that stood out to me was seek justice.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.840]   Because we're not just meant to let the issues come to us.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:48.400]   We're actually, as the body of Christ, as a church, meant to actively figure out who
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:57.480]   are the oppressed, who are the ones that are marginalized, and what can we do about it.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.040]   And to seek justice also means to discern God's will for this group of people that are
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.080]   facing these situations.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.160]   And then it also means action.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.560]   To seek justice means action.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.080]   It's not just talking beautifully, but it's then actually working out, fleshing out, how
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.400]   do we put things in action?
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.580]   How do we plead their case?
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.760]   How do we help?
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.960]   How do we change?
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.200]   How do we contribute to the shalom of society?
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.600]   And so that's what we're going to look at today.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.360]   We're going to hear from Branches of Hope here in a minute.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.680]   Right now, in just a moment, we're going to watch a video from Pastor Tony Reed.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.680]   He's actually with us today.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.920]   I know he doesn't want attention, but okay, do you mind giving us a little wave?
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   There he is.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   Thank you.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:48.360]   So, for those of you who don't know, Tony is one of the founding pastors of the Vine
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.680]   Church, and you've seen John a lot, and so he, together with John, they co-pastored.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.960]   And so he's going to share with us about the origin story of how Branches of Hope came
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.960]   to be.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   So let's watch this video.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.960]   Let's do that now.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:09.600]   I guess when we went into it at first, we were fairly simple in terms of our thinking
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.440]   of what we were trying to do.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:18.600]   As we continued to understand what we were about, we had to provide a much wider range
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:29.360]   of services from financial support and resettlement, doing research, social engagement, empowerment,
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:39.720]   and in fact, a whole range of services that are suitable for marginalized communities.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.880]   Social justice has been part of the church for a long time, right from the beginnings,
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:52.840]   but when we were just a small community within the basement of a hotel, meeting on Sundays
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:59.860]   only with maybe about 80 or 90 people, it was hard for us to put that into practice.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:05.920]   But several years later, by the time we'd moved into our own premises, we realized that
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.160]   we had perhaps better facilities to offer what we would describe as a 24/7 service.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.680]   And at that time, God provided an opportunity for us.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.720]   Quite amazing.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:26.880]   We had this letter from an asylum seeker who was being detained at the time, and he asked
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.520]   us if we would come and visit him.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.800]   And so, of course, we felt this was the right thing to do to respond well to it.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.560]   And we went to see him.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.280]   We went through all the procedures of getting in and understanding how all of that worked.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.480]   And we developed a relationship with him, visited him regularly.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:52.400]   So when it came for the time for him to be released and others to be released, they asked
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.600]   if they could come to our church.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.800]   And we said, "Yes, of course, we'd be delighted if you came."
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:07.920]   And the ministry of working with the asylum seekers has now grown into the ROAD program,
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:15.840]   which is part of Branches of Hope.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:26.160]   We were asked to host a gala performance of a documentary film produced by another NGO,
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:33.480]   which showed the difficulties and issues of sex trafficking in various parts of the world.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:41.560]   And when we saw this, we were quite astonished because the understanding of what is involved
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:47.080]   in sex trafficking was not generally understood at that time.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:55.280]   We soon began to realize just the trauma and the grooming that went on and just the difficulty
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:04.000]   that girls had who were brought into and forced to provide services in that area.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.200]   And so after we had watched this, we began to ask the question, "What is happening in
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   Hong Kong?
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:18.600]   And how is this related to what's going on in Hong Kong?"
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:28.280]   We formed a small movement within the church, I guess it was, of people who were interested
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:38.680]   in trying to work with people who had been subject to trafficking or to exploitation.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:47.440]   And as a result of that, an organization called Stop Trafficking of People was formed and
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:58.120]   eventually came under the direction and heading of Branches of Hope.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:05.400]   Branches of Hope is the Vine community's investment to the city of Hong Kong.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:12.840]   It is basically our witness to the truth and the vitality of the gospel.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:19.080]   And so it is important in that sense that we provide something which is a visible evidence
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.880]   of what we believe.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:31.220]   Well I ask the congregation to listen carefully to the work and the experience of Branches
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.520]   of Hope today.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:40.160]   And as you consider this, to ask the Holy Spirit to guide you and to give generously
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:48.680]   so that this work can continue and that Branches of Hope get the support and the assistance
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.920]   that they need to do the work which is vital to us.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:19:11.640]   You know, I love just hearing the story of how Branches of Hope got started.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640]   And it's amazing, right?
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.880]   It starts small and then as we pay attention to one individual and then learn about what's
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:23.360]   going on, you know, then we can open our heart to God and what God wants to do.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.960]   But right now I'm super excited to welcome Alex up.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.040]   Let's give him a warm welcome.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.600]   He is the executive director of Branches of Hope.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.200]   He also brought a team, so I also want to say hi to the team.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   Hi team.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   Yes.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.680]   Thank you so much for being here today and also all the volunteers who volunteer with
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.040]   Branches of Hope as well.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.240]   So I have a question for you, Alex.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.240]   Where are you from?
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.120]   Oh, that's a trick question, isn't it?
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.060]   I am also from Germany as it happens.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.960]   So I guess we can just do this in German now, right?
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.960]   Everybody's cool with that?
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.960]   Okay.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960]   No, sorry.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.520]   I'm always excited to, you know, see Alex and chat a little German, but would love to
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.720]   hear if you can tell us a little bit about Branches of Hope, your involvement with it,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.840]   you know, what you're doing there, what brought you here today?
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   Thank you.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.880]   So, well, long story short, what brought me here, but here being Hong Kong, is my lovely
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.000]   wife Jennifer.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.800]   She's been in Hong Kong for almost 18 years and she went on a sabbatical in 2014 and,
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.560]   well, she basically brought me back.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.640]   So that's how I ended up here.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.320]   I have a career with international humanitarian agencies, the Red Cross, Caritas, and so on
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320]   and so forth.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:54.360]   So when Jennifer said, well, you know, put her foot down and said, you know, family,
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.160]   marital life, you're coming to Hong Kong, I said, okay.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.280]   And it was actually quite a natural fit to be blessed with the opportunity of joining
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.160]   Branches of Hope.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.320]   My wife has been coming to the Vine Church for a long time, so we were already aware
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.840]   of the great work that the church does and obviously by extension Branches of Hope.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.160]   And when this opportunity came up, I obviously jumped at the chance.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.160]   Awesome.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.560]   Well, we have a lot of people here who are not that familiar with Branches of Hope.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.720]   So maybe you can tell us about Branches of Hope in a nutshell, give us just a little
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.160]   bit of an overview of what you guys do.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.160]   Yeah, sure.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.160]   I'd love to.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:36.600]   I mean, just to expand on what Tony had mentioned in the video, really in a nutshell, Branches
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:42.280]   of Hope was established to be the justice expression of the Vine Church.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:48.400]   It was basically taking what had been established as a ministry and supercharging it with the
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.340]   possibilities of a nonprofit organization.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.480]   So we have two programs.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:58.400]   We have the Refugee Opportunity and Development Program, which serves, as the name suggests,
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.120]   refugees and asylum seekers.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:06.120]   And then we also have the Stop Trafficking of People Program or STOP, which serves those
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:11.920]   who are experiencing situations of trafficking or also labor exploitation.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:17.040]   Although these are two very different communities, we have a unified approach the way that we
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.380]   do our work, which we call the three pillars of service.
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:25.400]   Those three pillars are care, empowerment, and social change.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.720]   I think care is quite self-explanatory, but I'll get to that in a minute.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.840]   But really, for us, the core is empowerment.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.040]   We believe in the self-agency of the people that we work with.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.560]   It's very important for us to make sure that, as our motto suggests, we restore dignity,
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.560]   justice, and hope.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.120]   So giving people that dignity and making sure that they can be seen as a whole person and
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.880]   have the ability to do things independently is very, very close to our heart.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.880]   We do that in a number of different ways.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:59.220]   But we also realize that a lot of the marginalized group that we do serve, if you're not coming
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.480]   alongside of them to address their material needs, it's very difficult for them to be
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.080]   in a place where they can even consider empowerment and personal development.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.960]   And so that's where care comes in.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:16.440]   And then last but not least, if we aren't really telling their story, not just seeking
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:21.320]   them out, but ultimately letting others know of the issues that they're facing, which we
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.680]   do through social change, again, we would not be doing them full justice.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.900]   So that's kind of what we do.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.760]   Our mission is to restore dignity, justice, and hope, so that's where the motto comes
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.280]   from.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.600]   And our vision is that all vulnerable and marginalized individuals and communities in
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.200]   Hong Kong will have equal access to resources and opportunities that allow them to realize
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.440]   their dreams and give them a voice in society.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:54.000]   So in the origin story, you heard that the Vine and at BOH, that there was a relationship.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.200]   Maybe you can tell us a little about that relationship, what that looks like now.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.920]   Yeah, I mean, we're still very, very closely aligned in many respects.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.560]   I mean, just physically, essentially, right?
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.640]   I mean, we share office space with the Vine in Wan Chai and are very, very fortunate to
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.760]   do that.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:18.600]   But even though we're an independent organization, we share the same Christian faith, so ultimately
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:24.440]   we have the same values, we're built on the same DNA, you can say.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.480]   And there's formal and informal ways that that actually is strengthened.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.200]   So formally, we have our own board of directors, but actually half of the directors on our
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.840]   board are current or former elders of the Vine Church.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.400]   So we make sure that in terms of our vision, in terms of our direction, we're very, very
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.760]   closely aligned.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:47.840]   But beyond that, we're extraordinarily fortunate that the Vine continues also to tie to us,
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.760]   which is a major advantage for us compared to other organizations.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.720]   It's some of the things that allows us to be as generous as we are in the services that
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   we provide.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.960]   I'll talk a little bit about our STAR program, for example.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.520]   That's a financial assistance program that's 100% in and 100% out.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.760]   We don't take a cut from that because we have the support from the Vine Church, right?
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.760]   That's really important.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.000]   And then, of course, the congregation.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.880]   I mean, the biggest source of support in terms of private donors or volunteers or other people
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.420]   who come and serve alongside us is the congregation.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.600]   So those are all the different levels that we're so closely aligned.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.160]   Thank you for sharing us more about that relationship.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:34.960]   We're also excited for Branches of Hope to get more involved here in Yuen Long.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.660]   And so there's been conversations around that.
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.760]   I think later on, we're going to hear a little bit about it as well.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.460]   But right now, you mentioned RØDE and STAR.
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.600]   Could you tell us a little bit more about what they are so we can understand?
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.720]   So I think just starting with RØDE, then.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:26:02.520]   So through the RØDE program, we've served several hundred refugees and asylum seekers.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:08.200]   In fact, we have over 1,400 registered with us in the system.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.360]   That represents almost 10% of the overall refugee and asylum-seeking population here
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.680]   in Hong Kong.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.400]   Maybe you're asking yourself, what is a refugee, right?
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.720]   So refugees are people who have fled for one reason or another.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.240]   Could be persecution, could be war, could be other reasons.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.380]   They're a home country and are seeking protection in a third country, right?
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.360]   So that's what brings people to Hong Kong.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.080]   The thing about Hong Kong, though, is it's really important to understand is that if
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:44.120]   somebody comes to Hong Kong to become an asylum seeker, to become a refugee, they cannot stay
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.120]   in Hong Kong.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:50.400]   Hong Kong is not a signatory to the refugee conventions, which means that even if they
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.160]   become recognized, that their claim is legitimate, that they are recognized as a refugee, eventually
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.280]   they will need to be resettled to a third country.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.800]   There's no integration in Hong Kong, right?
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:06.720]   Unfortunately, though, the reality is that the vast majority, over 99%, in fact, are
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:12.720]   not recognized as refugees and will eventually be returned to their country of origin.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.840]   And that can be a very painful experience because by that time they might have been
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.920]   in Hong Kong for 10, 15, 20 years even.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.760]   Their kids might have been going to school here, et cetera.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   And in that time also, they're not allowed to work.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:31.160]   They get some modest stipends from the government, but they're not enough.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.480]   And so that's really where the road steps in, right?
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.520]   The road program steps in to bridge those gaps, to make sure that people have the resources
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:43.040]   that they need to live a dignified life while they're here in Hong Kong.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.160]   We work with them to prepare them for the life after Hong Kong.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.940]   So we've been really working on something what we call durable solutions.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.520]   So this is the idea of helping people, either if they wanted to repatriate themselves to
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.160]   their home country or if they want to figure out ways of moving to a third country, we
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.220]   assist with those.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:08.480]   We have casework, so helping people find referrals to hospitals, find referrals to other services,
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.520]   material donations, food.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.520]   We help with figuring out shelter options, all of those things.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.800]   So that's the care side.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:23.240]   Under empowerment, we also do some limited adult education, which is actually where Yuen
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.280]   Long comes into play.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.240]   So we've got Jill over there.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   Hi, Jill.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   She's phenomenal.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.080]   She's actually set up a training program here with some of the community members to teach
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:39.120]   them how to sustain themselves on $40 a day, which is all they have for food.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:45.300]   So you can imagine it's quite challenging to purchase food and cook food on such a budget.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.000]   So those are the things that we do.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.060]   And last but not least, like I said, everything gears towards making sure that when that final
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.840]   step comes in Hong Kong, that they're ready for it.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.960]   You know, like as we talked about earlier, this is really a great opportunity to learn
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.800]   about issues that maybe we don't know that much about.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.400]   So thank you so much for sharing that with us.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.040]   Now there is also the STOP program.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.200]   Can you tell us a little bit more about what that's about?
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.440]   Yeah, of course.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:20.200]   So the STOP trafficking of people program is perhaps a little bit more tricky to wrap
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.200]   your head around, right?
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   I mean, what is even human trafficking?
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.920]   It's a form of modern slavery, and that sounds very scary.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.060]   It is very, very scary.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:37.320]   It involves the recruitment, transportation, or receipt of a person by means of force,
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.200]   fraud, or coercion for the purpose of exploitation.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.320]   So this is a very formal explanation.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.880]   And exploitation, I think, is more easily understood.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:51.720]   It's the unfair treatment of someone to benefit from their work or position of vulnerability.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:58.600]   Now for STOP, for our understanding, we understand human trafficking to exist on a spectrum,
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.560]   on a scale, right?
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:07.360]   You may have heard in the past, in other contexts, these sort of sensationalized stories of people
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:13.480]   who are kidnapped and brought across the border and then made to work in some sort of labor
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.120]   camp or something like that.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:20.600]   That does exist, but that's not really what we deal with on a nine to five at STOP.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:26.560]   I mean, what we really focus on is more the lower echelons of that, which starts with
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.840]   relatively benign forms of exploitation, right?
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:36.680]   So for example, if you have somebody who comes to Hong Kong as a migrant worker, and they
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.720]   are given a contract to work as a driver, for example, and then they are told, "Oh,
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.920]   but by the way, when you're off duty, you also need to go work in this restaurant,"
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.720]   or "You also need to go work in this construction site, and if you refuse, then we will cancel
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.400]   your visa, we will cancel your contract."
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   That's a form of coercion, right?
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.480]   They're doing something that they didn't come here to do, and whether or not they're paid
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.880]   for it is beside the point.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.640]   The fact that they're being threatened in order to do the work, that's where the exploitation
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.640]   starts.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.440]   That's the beginning of that spectrum of human trafficking.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.480]   And it can get worse, right?
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:15.860]   They can then maybe have their passport withheld or other sorts of abuse in that respect.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:24.160]   And so what we do is we step in when that kind of exploitation helps, takes place.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.400]   So we help people to, first of all, understand what their rights are and how they can seek
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.360]   help if something like this happens to them.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.920]   And to those who are facing those kind of situations, we make sure that they also have
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   the material support that they do.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:44.880]   Oftentimes the help that we provide is the only way that people are even able to access
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.120]   justice to begin with.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.880]   You can imagine if somebody's been, let's say for example a migrant domestic worker
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:58.040]   is scammed, their identity is stolen or they've been duped into doing some illegal act, their
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.080]   employer cancels their contract, and then they've got two weeks technically to find
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.960]   new work.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.440]   If you don't have support in that moment, there's no way that you can address those
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.440]   claims against you.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.240]   There's no way that you can access justice.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.000]   So we make sure that we work together with people to make sure that they know how to
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.040]   do that and that they have the resources to do that.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.720]   And last but not least, I'm also quite proud, the STOP team have really established themselves
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:29.360]   as a source of information and technical know-how.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.760]   So they do a lot of research actually that informs the work of other organizations that
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.120]   work in the same sector, best practices and policies and things like that.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.440]   So that's kind of what we do with STOP.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:45.240]   Yeah, so that's amazing work.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.000]   But I think it's also a lot for us to take in, right?
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.040]   Learning about road, learning about STOP, justice issues that are happening here in
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.200]   Hong Kong.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.960]   So to make it a little bit more tangible, Branches of Hope has prepared a couple of
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.960]   videos for us.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.480]   One is from Ali, who's part of the ROAD program, and then there's also Anna, who's part of
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.480]   the STOP program.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:18.480]   So let's watch that and then let's get back together after that.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.520]   My name is Ali.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.240]   I am from Yemen.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:31.600]   When I come Hong Kong, I need help for asylum seeker, for some home, some how can we live
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.600]   here.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:43.400]   The difficult government now give enough for rent, for food, everything, not enough.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.600]   This problem and the asylum seeker cannot work.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:52.560]   If I go work, maybe I go jail, catch me police or immigration.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.400]   This is problem.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.080]   And I worry for my family.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.040]   I have three baby here.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.800]   Yeah, because this big problem.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.400]   Some friend, he tell me, you can go buy insurance.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.920]   After I go after, help me.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:16.640]   I give extra money for rent, for something, for school.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:23.920]   Yeah, have class English because we boring in Hong Kong, no work, no.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:30.840]   I am happy because help me.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.760]   My friend, he help for some money every month.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:49.440]   We fine.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.440]   My name is Anna.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.080]   I am from the Philippines.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:35:00.720]   I came to Hong Kong my first time in 2019.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:06.280]   I work with my employer for four years and three months.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.160]   I came here through my sister-in-law.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.240]   She helped me to come here.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.880]   I have been involved with criminal exploitation.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.320]   The police came in my employer's house and then arrest me.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:30.280]   Some people, these people, I don't know, they use my name to use it in illegal criminal
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.280]   what is.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.560]   That's why I'm involved with this case.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.840]   Yeah, I lose my job.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:49.440]   I'm so grateful and blessed because I found my where to live because I don't have job.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.840]   I cannot afford to stay in the boarding house.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:01.520]   And then after that, my co-shelter introduced me about stop.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:08.840]   I go to the office and then ask for help.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:12.240]   The basic necessities, they help us.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.240]   They help me.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:22.600]   And then I also share with my, I can also share some with my co-shelter.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:27.840]   Not only financial, also emotional.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.800]   They are very, very care, very kind.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.040]   They help me a lot.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.280]   That's why I'm in good now.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:50.200]   I always thank God because even though I face this struggle, I'm about to face it because
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.600]   the people surround me, especially stop.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.040]   I feel, I feel not alone.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.640]   We can always rely on them.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:29.200]   Yeah, it's sobering to learn about those hardships and challenges they face.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:36.640]   Even as somebody who doesn't speak Cantonese and just thinking, how do you even get help
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.640]   and support?
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.040]   So thank you so much for the work that you guys do.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.640]   Maybe you can tell us how can we partner with you?
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.240]   How can we support the work that you're doing?
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.680]   Yeah, I'd love to.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:52.440]   Actually, one of the things I'd like to point out just before I get to that is, I wonder
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:59.840]   if you noticed that Ali in his sharing, he actually refers to the Vine Church, right?
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.880]   I think this goes back to the point I was making at the beginning.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:10.200]   A lot of the community members that we serve, they also come to the Vines Fellowship.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.920]   We have a refugee fellowship called Arise on Wednesdays.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.800]   We have a lot of crossover between those who are coming for fellowship and those who that
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.320]   we are helping with the services through Branches of Hope.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.160]   For them, there's no difference, right?
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.980]   It's the same organization.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.720]   It's the Vine Church that's helping.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:34.040]   I think it just shows how closely aligned we actually are on those fronts, right?
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:40.880]   But yeah, in terms of how we can work together, honestly, I'd like to highlight four things.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.480]   Prayer is the first.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.000]   Faith in action is the second.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.960]   Being our advocate is the third.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:53.000]   And fourth is financial support in general.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.160]   Now with prayer, what I'd like to kind of come back to is, again, this idea of the origins
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:05.480]   of Branches of Hope and our identity as a Christian organization, right?
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:12.320]   You know, in Luke 18, verse 2 to 8, Jesus tells his disciples a parable of the ungodly
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:19.000]   judge to make them understand that they should always pray and not give up.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.680]   And in Mark 11, verse 24, it says, "Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.880]   that you received it and it will be yours."
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.320]   This is fundamental to what we do.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:34.460]   We understand that without God, without the Holy Spirit moving among people, supporting
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:39.160]   what we do, providing the resources that we need, there is no moving forward.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.160]   And so we always ask for people to pray on our behalf, to pray for the communities that
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.400]   we serve, to pray that the resources that we need come through.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.480]   But of course, faith in action is an important one.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:58.640]   I think James has a lot to say about faith in action as well, but fundamentally, there's
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.160]   lots of opportunities for people to come and volunteer at Branches of Hope as well.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.600]   In fact, we've got a football tournament coming up.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.440]   I'm very sad not to see you play, Tim.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.440]   We're in the tournament, right?
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.440]   I am playing.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.440]   You are playing?
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   I am playing, yeah.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   I take that back.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.440]   I might not be good, but I am playing.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.440]   We'll just make sure that you stand in front of the goal.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.600]   I'll just lay in front of the goal and block it.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.280]   But yeah, look, I mean, if you want to do something fun on the 11th of October, please
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.440]   come sign up as a volunteer.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.360]   We've got plenty of things that you can do.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.560]   In general, when we have events, we love having volunteers work with us, but also for other
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.560]   things.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:38.280]   I mean, Jill, again, is a fantastic example of what you can do if you want to serve the
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   community.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   Come talk to us.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.880]   We're very happy to support initiatives of this kind.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.560]   So yeah, faith in action, right?
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.840]   Then being our advocate.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.760]   Today is a really great example of taking a moment, and we're really very, very grateful
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:57.720]   for this opportunity also to speak here, but taking a moment to understand what issues
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:02.560]   are out there, seeking out, again, what the issues are.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.040]   Because if you know, then you can tell others about it as well.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.360]   You can follow us on social media.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.560]   You can share our social media stuff.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.560]   Sign up for the newsletter.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:16.000]   Continue to educate yourself about what's going on and tell others about it.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.680]   If you work for a company, if you work at a school, invite us to come and talk to students,
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.680]   to colleagues.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.580]   We love doing that kind of stuff as well, just to be able to get more people to know
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.760]   about what's going on.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.720]   And then of course, financial support.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.160]   I mean, obviously, we cannot keep going.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.520]   We cannot keep doing what we do.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:39.520]   We cannot keep the lights on without the support of individuals like yourselves to make sure
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.640]   that we can keep doing what we do.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:48.440]   We're actually just in the process of launching a new financial assistance program in 2025
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.600]   called the STAR program.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.540]   This is essentially superseding a previous program.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:59.200]   Some of you may even know Secret Angel program, if you're familiar with that.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:03.960]   But basically, we provide monthly allowances to the community members.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.360]   And this is what I meant before, right?
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.120]   It's 100% in and out.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.640]   So you can sign up for that.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:14.360]   There's other ways that you can also support our programs, whether it's making a monthly
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.160]   donation or a one-off donation.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.600]   So there's all of that kind of stuff as well.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.680]   And please do come say hello to my wonderful colleagues over there afterwards.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.080]   We've also got some very cool merch.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.560]   I mean, if anybody likes the socks.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.560]   Nice.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.040]   So yeah, please do come and check it out.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.600]   I just bought them before and put them on.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.760]   But I hope it's all gonna be good because I didn't wash them.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.580]   I like them.
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.640]   So we heard basically four things that we can do, right?
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.360]   We can pray.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:54.260]   And as we've been sharing, your prayer really opens us up to the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.880]   and God works through prayers.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.060]   So we can pray for branches of hope.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.920]   We can put our faith in action.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:06.840]   We can volunteer and seek out opportunities to serve with branches of hope.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:11.480]   We also can support the STAR program or donate.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.080]   And I feel like I'm forgetting one.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.960]   No, those are all four, right?
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.960]   Those are all four.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.600]   Prayer, faith in action, education.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   Education and advocating.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   That was it.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:26.440]   And it's interesting with that because when I've brought up talking about human trafficking
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:32.080]   to others in Hong Kong, a lot of times there's a response, "No, there is no such thing here."
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:38.460]   And so there really is a chance to advocate and to educate as well and that's super powerful.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:42.200]   So is there anything else that you would like to share with us?
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.080]   Yeah, I guess, like you said, we've covered a lot of ground today.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.720]   I'd like to come back again to sort of like the fundamentals a little bit, right?
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:55.640]   To talk a little bit about our motto, dignity, justice, hope.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:00.960]   And how those relate specifically to the three pillars of service that I mentioned, right?
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.320]   So we've got care, empowerment, and social change.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.360]   Care restores hope.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.120]   When we care for somebody, we give them hope.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.960]   Hope is when we have friends around us.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.280]   Empowerment restores dignity.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.280]   When people are empowered, they are encouraged to be self-sufficient.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.360]   Again, this self-agency of the people that we serve.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.960]   And that restores their dignity.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.140]   It allows them to care for themselves instead of depending on a handout.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:33.640]   And the restoration of dignity comes when we work together and support each other.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:38.300]   And then last but not least, social change restores justice.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:43.440]   When our society is reformed to protect the marginalized, we actually restore justice.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.640]   And this is kind of what you were saying in your message earlier as well, right?
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.960]   Like we, as Christians, we're called to seek it out, right?
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.700]   We're supposed to make this world a better place, right?
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.440]   And so social change is what restores justice.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.280]   And I think, you know, apart from us being very grateful for being here, it's also an
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:06.760]   invitation to all of you to be part of that process so that we can together restore dignity,
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.200]   justice, and hope.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.200]   I love this.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.400]   Thank you so much, Alex, for being here.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.400]   Let's give Alex a round of applause.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.400]   Thanks.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:23.040]   I would love to actually invite you all to stand.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:27.880]   And I also want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:33.560]   And we heard today, you know, these ways that we can respond to what has been shared.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:38.960]   We actually took some time to learn about injustices that are happening in our city
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:46.440]   and how we can just love and support and make other people's challenges our challenges,
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:50.700]   other people's issues our issue, right?
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.880]   And I would love for every one of us to think of one thing, you know, one of these four
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.800]   things that they shared that we can do, right?
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.580]   Because our faith is about action.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:00.720]   If you want to pray, pray.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.340]   If you want to advocate and share about how you can help, do that.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:09.080]   If you want to put faith and action through serving, you know, do that.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.880]   And if you want to give financially, support them in their work to do, let's do that.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.040]   Let me pray for us.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:23.520]   Jesus, we thank you that, yeah, you came and you died and rose so that we can be different
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:31.720]   people, that we can be people who love you, but also love our neighbors and who care about
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:36.840]   those who are suffering, those who are experiencing injustices, and that you have sent us out
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:44.420]   to heal and advocate and to speak up for and to provide and to care for those in need.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:47.840]   But we also know that it's you moving through your spirit.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.640]   So Holy Spirit, I just pray that you will move in our church, that you help us to be
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:58.680]   a church that does justice here in the city, that seeks it out and learns to do right.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.820]   And will you guide us in that?
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.300]   So I pray all this in your name, Jesus.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:03.800]   Amen.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
