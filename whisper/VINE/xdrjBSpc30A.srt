1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 Well, it's good to see you all and to be back.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,840
 I am excited about Christmas.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,840
 I'm excited about introducing Christmas traditions

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,000
 to my baby girl, Ellie.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,560
 In Germany, they have a tradition.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,040
 It's a Christmas calendar,

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,400
 but it's not the chocolate calendar.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,420
 It's like it's a calendar that has big pockets

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,960
 and every day there's actually

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,260
 quite a significant gift in there.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,600
 So I'm ready.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,920
 That's my one decoration.

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,520
 (laughs)

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,640
 But anyhow, hey, it's good to see you.

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
 Now, when I was in university,

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,940
 and I feel like I've been talking about university a lot,

17
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,700
 so it's like far in the past,

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,000
 I did what university students do.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,520
 I studied, I played basketball,

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,840
 and I hung out with my friends.

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,340
 Now, there was one semester or one season

22
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,300
 where I really studied a lot,

23
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,280
 like all the time.

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,960
 And my friends, they went on these exciting road trips.

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,120
 They went to Vancouver, you know, Canada on a road trip.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,560
 They did all sorts of stuff,

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,480
 but I didn't go 'cause I needed to study,

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,140
 or I felt like I needed to study.

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,080
 And so I missed out on all these fun trips.

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,340
 I missed out on hanging out with my friends.

31
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,240
 And when I look back at that time,

32
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,520
 I actually think that I chose the wrong thing

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,400
 because I should have spent time with my friends

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,240
 instead of studying.

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,240
 Now, I know I'm in Hong Kong.

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,420
 I am aware.

37
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,440
 There's a lot of parents from Hong Kong here.

38
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,040
 And I do believe studying is important.

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,760
 I did study.

40
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760
 I was a good student, so I actually got good grades,

41
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,840
 but what I'm actually talking about

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,480
 is I studied excessively

43
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,440
 'cause there was a fear inside of me somehow

44
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,440
 that I needed to do more in order to do well.

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,500
 And it actually kept me from really enjoying my friendships,

46
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,000
 and it kept me from having better relationships

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,560
 with my friends.

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,480
 Now, luckily, I didn't do that throughout all university,

49
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,620
 but I did it for a part of my studies.

50
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,560
 But isn't that interesting how we can invest ourselves

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,800
 in the things that we think are so important

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,840
 at that moment in our lives?

53
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
 You know, you take all the time,

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,120
 you take all the energy, maybe even a lot of resources,

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,920
 and then when we look back at those things,

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,360
 we realize that they really did not matter that much

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
 or that they're really not that important.

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,560
 And so for me, it was studying excessively

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,720
 didn't improve my grades,

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,060
 lowered the quality of my friendships.

61
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,560
 I mean, that was basically it.

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,480
 For a lot of us, I believe it's working excessively, right?

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,240
 There's this saying I used to put as a screensaver

64
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,400
 on my phone that says,

65
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,400
 "Nobody ever regrets spending,"

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,260
 wait, how does it go?

67
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,400
 (audience laughing)

68
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,520
 Let me get this right.

69
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,120
 Nobody, well, let me just,

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,720
 I'm not gonna remember this.

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,280
 Basically, it's the moral of the story.

72
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,120
 How about that?

73
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,800
 The moral of the story is this,

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,200
 that when we're at the end of our lives,

75
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,000
 we never wish that we would have spent

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
 more time at the office.

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,000
 Finally, we landed there, right?

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,560
 Took me a while, but I made it, yes.

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,400
 (audience applauding)

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,440
 Got a little confused there in my brain.

81
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,720
 And the thing is, why do we work so much?

82
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,280
 Is it sometimes maybe it's to please someone,

83
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,560
 sometimes it's because we want promotion,

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,520
 we're chasing after better income for our family,

85
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,760
 and up to a certain degree, that can be okay,

86
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,280
 but there is also an excessiveness

87
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,860
 to that a lot of times in us.

88
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,700
 Other ways that we might invest ourselves in things,

89
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,960
 maybe there's some relationships that are not that important

90
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,960
 but for some reason, they absorb all our time and our energy,

91
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,560
 and so we give people all our time and energy

92
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,640
 instead of the ones that we should give it to.

93
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,560
 Now, I don't know what you're investing yourself in,

94
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,840
 what you're spending your time on,

95
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,200
 what you're using your energy for,

96
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,080
 but what I wanna explore with you today

97
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,080
 is how can we make investments that truly matter?

98
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,160
 How can we focus on using our energy, our resources,

99
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,400
 our time, and put it in the place

100
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,600
 that actually is really important?

101
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
 So that when we look back, we don't have to say,

102
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,520
 "Oh my gosh, what did I do?

103
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,760
 "I missed out on all these fun road trips."

104
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,240
 You know, and we have to be bummed,

105
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,880
 that's quite, you know, I can get over that one,

106
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,960
 but there's other things, you know,

107
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,600
 where there can be great regrets,

108
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,480
 and we can miss out greatly on, of course,

109
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,520
 also especially what actually God has for us.

110
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,640
 And so we're continuing in our sermon series,

111
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,240
 Living the Kingdom Parables.

112
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,400
 We've been looking every week

113
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,600
 at one of the parables of Jesus.

114
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,720
 Part of it, what we're looking to do

115
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,040
 is to be challenged by them,

116
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,120
 you know, for Jesus to challenge us

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,200
 in our attitudes and our thinking,

118
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,320
 and so that we can respond and align ourselves,

119
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,120
 you know, to his kingdom values,

120
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,640
 and we can shift our perspective,

121
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,080
 we can live differently in light of,

122
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,040
 you know, Jesus' teaching.

123
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,400
 And so I wanna encourage us

124
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,360
 as we go now more into the message,

125
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,720
 actually to open your heart and say,

126
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,840
 "Lord, I wanna be challenged by you.

127
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,520
 "I wanna hear from you what you have to say to me."

128
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,920
 And so, actually, let me pray for us.

129
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,360
 Let me pray a prayer over us.

130
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,320
 Heavenly Father, we are here

131
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,880
 because we wanna hear from you.

132
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,280
 We desperately need to hear from you.

133
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,720
 We wanna have you speak into our lives

134
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,680
 and say yes to what you have for us,

135
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,240
 because what you have is always the best.

136
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,920
 So will you prepare our hearts now

137
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,680
 to receive what you have?

138
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,960
 I praise in your name, Jesus.

139
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,800
 Amen. - Amen.

140
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,080
 - So we're in the Gospel of Luke,

141
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,560
 and I just wanna set the context

142
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,880
 before we go into a specific parable.

143
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,440
 So there is, the context is,

144
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,840
 it actually says there's thousands of people.

145
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
 Around Jesus.

146
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,360
 And Jesus is teaching his disciples.

147
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,400
 So it's kind of like he's teaching his disciples

148
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,800
 and everybody else is listening to him

149
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,120
 teaching his disciples.

150
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,920
 And the topic that he's teaching on

151
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,640
 is actually on obstacles to discipleship,

152
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,360
 like things that keep you from following Jesus,

153
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,680
 that can derail you in your journey of being a Christian.

154
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,720
 And the thing that Jesus talks right before we get

155
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,120
 to the text that we're gonna look at

156
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,560
 is he talks about fearing God, about fearing man,

157
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,960
 and he talks about being faithful to him,

158
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,640
 even in persecution.

159
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,560
 You know, even when we face persecution,

160
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,680
 that we are faithful to Jesus.

161
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,040
 And so then he moves to the next obstacle,

162
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,240
 and that's where we're gonna pick up.

163
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,760
 So we're in Luke chapter 12, starting in verse 13,

164
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,480
 it says this.

165
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,280
 Someone in the crowd said to him,

166
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,240
 "Teacher, tell my brother, divide inheritance with me."

167
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,120
 Jesus replied, "Man, who appointed me judge

168
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,480
 "or an arbiter between you?"

169
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,040
 Then he said to them, "Watch out.

170
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,720
 "Be on your guard against all kinds of greed.

171
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,440
 "Life does not consist in abundance of possessions."

172
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,000
 So we're gonna walk through this piece by piece.

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,720
 So I'm not reading everything to you right now.

174
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,720
 But here's a man, maybe he interrupts Jesus,

175
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,640
 maybe he just sees the moment when Jesus is quiet

176
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,680
 for one second, he jumps in,

177
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,560
 and he brings a request to Jesus.

178
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,440
 And he asks Jesus to make a ruling over inheritance,

179
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,840
 I guess, fight or conflict

180
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,640
 that him and his brother are having.

181
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,320
 Now, why does he come to Jesus with that?

182
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,440
 Well, if you notice, he addresses Jesus as a teacher.

183
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,640
 So people around Jesus, they saw him as a teacher

184
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,840
 with authority, a teacher also of the law, a rabbi.

185
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,760
 And at that time, all the rules regarding even inheritance,

186
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,360
 they were in the Torah, they were in the first five books

187
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,400
 of the Bible, of the Hebrew scripture.

188
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,920
 And so a lot of times rabbis and teachers,

189
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,200
 they made actually rulings, they made judgments,

190
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,360
 and then made decisions, helped the community,

191
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
 sorted out things.

192
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,400
 Might be a little bit like a pastor

193
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,440
 helping two conflicting parties settle an issue.

194
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,160
 And what's interesting though,

195
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,080
 is the man that approaches Jesus,

196
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,960
 if we pay close attention,

197
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,880
 he actually doesn't ask Jesus to mediate.

198
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,720
 He wants Jesus to do what's on his agenda.

199
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,600
 He wants him to make a ruling that inheritance is divided.

200
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,080
 You know, so he comes to Jesus,

201
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,960
 he wants Jesus to fulfill his plans, his purposes.

202
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,280
 He's actually not interested in anything else.

203
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,800
 He just wants Jesus to do what he wants him to do.

204
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,800
 And one thing with that is,

205
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
 you know, that he's not interested

206
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,280
 in restoring his relationship with his brother.

207
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,520
 He just wants to get his, he wants to get his inheritance.

208
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,160
 He wants to get what he thinks is owed to him,

209
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,480
 and there is no room for another perspective.

210
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,760
 He just wants Jesus to do what he wants him to do.

211
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,680
 And Jesus, you know, being wise, being discerning,

212
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,320
 you know, he decides not to do a ruling,

213
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,840
 not to do a judging, but then instead,

214
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,240
 he actually turns around and he starts teaching everyone.

215
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,000
 So not just the man who asked him a question,

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,080
 not just the disciples,

217
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,920
 but he's speaking to the whole crowd.

218
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,600
 And what he says to them is,

219
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,720
 we find in verse 15, he says,

220
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,160
 "Watch out, be on your guard against all kinds of greed.

221
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,760
 "Life does not consist in abundance of possessions."

222
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,440
 Now just imagine yourself, you bring an issue to Jesus,

223
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,600
 and then Jesus uses that as a springboard

224
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,320
 and starts teaching everyone around you.

225
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,120
 And he kind of implies, you know,

226
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,560
 that your requests involved some greed.

227
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,280
 Makes us feel a little uncomfortable, right?

228
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,400
 But why does Jesus bring it to everyone?

229
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,760
 Because greed, it's a human issue.

230
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,600
 It's actually something that not just this man

231
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,440
 needs to hear about,

232
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,440
 it's something that everyone needs to hear about.

233
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
 'Cause we all, to one degree or another, have heart issues,

234
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
 you know, when it comes to possessions and money

235
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,280
 and inheritance and all those things.

236
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,800
 And so Jesus addresses everyone.

237
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,520
 Now at this point in time,

238
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,720
 it's also important to remember

239
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
 when Jesus addresses something like that,

240
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,320
 he never does it to shame or to put down.

241
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,920
 He does it because he wants to bring life,

242
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
 he wants to bring wholeness

243
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
 to an area in our lives that is broken.

244
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,920
 He wants to do something new,

245
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,480
 he wants to do something better.

246
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,920
 And so we just need to keep that in mind

247
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
 as we walk through the story.

248
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,600
 So Jesus starts warning us against greed

249
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
 and actually false narratives that we believe.

250
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,800
 He says in verse 15,

251
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,600
 "Life does not consist in abundance of possessions."

252
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,280
 But we actually believe that it does, right?

253
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,400
 We actually believe that life or abundant life

254
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,200
 exists in abundance of possession.

255
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,640
 And so he's starting to address this,

256
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,080
 this lie, this narrative that we hold that,

257
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,920
 if I only have this much money,

258
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,280
 if I only have this house or this whatever,

259
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,160
 you know, then I will be okay,

260
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,040
 then I will live the good life.

261
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,840
 But Jesus, you know, is saying that's not true.

262
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,880
 You know, abundant life does not consist in these things.

263
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,000
 Well, let's continue in the story, verse 16.

264
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,160
 And he told him this parable,

265
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,520
 "The ground of a certain rich man

266
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,720
 yielded an abundant harvest.

267
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,400
 He thought to himself, 'What shall I do?

268
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,160
 I have no place to store my crops.'

269
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,880
 Then he said, 'This is what I will do.

270
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,520
 I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones.

271
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,160
 And there I will store my surplus grain.

272
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,240
 And I'll say to myself,

273
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,480
 'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years.

274
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,200
 Take life easy, eat, drink, and be merry.'"

275
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,440
 Now, in this parable,

276
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,280
 you know, there's a rich man, we're not told why he's rich.

277
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,560
 There's no hint that he did anything unethical.

278
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,000
 You know, he didn't somehow do some shady, dirty deals

279
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,480
 and screw somebody over.

280
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,240
 But we're just told he's wealthy.

281
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,800
 And then there's another thing that happens.

282
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,480
 There's an abundant harvest.

283
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,800
 So on top of being already rich,

284
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,040
 his ground, you know, from whatever land he owned,

285
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,200
 is yielding just an absolutely incredible harvest,

286
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,240
 much more than expected or would be usual.

287
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,720
 So he's already rich,

288
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,080
 and now he gets this extra stuff on top of it.

289
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,560
 And this creates a challenge for him.

290
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,680
 You know, what is he going to do with it?

291
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,400
 And it's interesting because we're actually let in

292
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,800
 on this inner dialogue in the parable

293
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,720
 where we can hear his thoughts.

294
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,000
 It's kind of scary, right?

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,600
 If we could hear each other's thoughts.

296
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,920
 But we get to hear his thoughts.

297
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,920
 So good it's that way around, not the other way around.

298
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,840
 And we get to listen into his own inner dialogue.

299
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,000
 And so he's like, "Oh, what am I going to do?"

300
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,920
 You know, with all this extra crop?

301
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,960
 Because there's a problem.

302
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,640
 His barns are full.

303
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,480
 And it's plural.

304
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,520
 He has, you know, multiple barns.

305
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,760
 He doesn't just have one, he has multiple ones.

306
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,400
 And so he comes up with a solution.

307
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,480
 I'm going to tear them down.

308
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,200
 I'm going to do bigger ones.

309
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,680
 I'm going to store it up.

310
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,800
 And then he concludes the whole thing with saying that,

311
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
 you know, and when that's done,

312
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,840
 he can enjoy his life and leisure and eat, drink,

313
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
 and be merry.

314
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,040
 That's his plan.

315
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,600
 You know, that's his conversation.

316
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,480
 And from our perspective,

317
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
 if we would not know that Jesus beforehand

318
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,560
 talks about greed,

319
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,880
 if we just would hear the story in a different context,

320
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,960
 we actually would be quite impressed with this man.

321
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,760
 Wow, you know, here's somebody who can scale a business.

322
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,320
 Here's somebody who can be prudent and build wealth.

323
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,320
 If there was a YouTube video or something,

324
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,680
 we're like, wow, you know, this guy's like,

325
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
 he made it from like not having as much

326
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,800
 and he built his business empire.

327
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,320
 You know, that's impressive.

328
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,320
 Now, because this is in the context of Jesus teaching,

329
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,960
 we know what comes before, we know there's some issue.

330
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,120
 But what is it?

331
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,800
 You know, what is the issue that Jesus is addressing here?

332
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,440
 Well, if you pay close attention to the inner dialogue,

333
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,440
 we start getting a hint at what the problem is.

334
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,120
 And it actually reveals to us, you know,

335
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,360
 some of the values and some of the motivations

336
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,840
 that this man's holding in his heart.

337
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,240
 So if you notice, there's all these I and my statements.

338
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,680
 You know, it's all about him.

339
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,080
 It's all about what he has done.

340
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,720
 It's all his.

341
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,240
 It's like my crops, my abundance, my surplus, myself.

342
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,360
 Actually, the word translated here is myself is my soul.

343
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,120
 You know, it's all my, my, my, I, I, I.

344
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,600
 There is no thought of anyone else

345
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 and there is no thought of God.

346
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,400
 You know, there's an absence of acknowledgement of God.

347
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,520
 So this goes in contrast, you know,

348
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,240
 to what Psalm 24 once says,

349
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,280
 says the earth is the Lord's and everything in it,

350
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,680
 the world and all who live in it.

351
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,880
 Which means that actually, you know,

352
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,440
 God has created everything.

353
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,360
 And all that we have, including our life,

354
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,640
 our breath, our health, whatever possessions we have,

355
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,720
 everything is a gift from God.

356
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,360
 Every single thing.

357
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,480
 Now we a lot of times think we did it ourselves.

358
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,520
 You know, but everything we have is a gift from God.

359
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,240
 And this man, you know, there is no God in his equation.

360
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,680
 I mean, he thinks it's all him.

361
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,360
 So this is where the twist comes into the parable.

362
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,480
 Verse 20, but God said to him,

363
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,480
 you fool, this very night,

364
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,040
 your life will be demanded from you.

365
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,040
 Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?

366
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,040
 This is how it will be with whoever stores up things

367
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,040
 for themselves, but is not rich towards God.

368
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,400
 So while most of us, you know,

369
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,600
 when we look at this story, what made me think, wow,

370
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,760
 a prudent, successful businessman

371
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,080
 who knows how to scale a business and accumulate wealth

372
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,080
 and do something good, God calls him a fool.

373
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,000
 You fool.

374
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,880
 It's quite a different verdict than we would expect, right?

375
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,360
 It's also quite strong language, right?

376
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,640
 To be called a fool.

377
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:05,040
 So why does God call this man a fool?

378
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,880
 Well, God calls this man a fool

379
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,760
 because all of his investments,

380
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,640
 all of his wealth is directed towards himself.

381
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,280
 It's all for himself.

382
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,000
 There's no thought of neighbor.

383
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,080
 You know, it's all about himself.

384
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,160
 And he just cares about himself.

385
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,120
 He just invests the money on himself.

386
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,880
 He doesn't think of anyone else.

387
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,560
 There's no acknowledgement of God.

388
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:40,240
 There is, he actually sees his money as a security.

389
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,160
 You know that, you can see that in his plans, right?

390
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,120
 He has a plans that like, I will live the abundant life.

391
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,320
 I'm going to eat, drink, be merry, enjoy my wealth.

392
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,960
 So he actually placed his faith in his possessions,

393
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,560
 but he lacks faith in God.

394
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,640
 And he thinks that his possessions

395
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,560
 will give him the security of his anxious heart,

396
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
 that the possessions will make sure

397
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,640
 that he's going to be okay.

398
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,800
 But when it comes to the end of his life,

399
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,200
 they actually don't deliver.

400
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,320
 And the lie is exposed.

401
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,320
 That so many of us, that we actually kind of believe, right?

402
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,000
 If we're honest.

403
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,520
 And then in verse 20, we find out that God tells him,

404
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,400
 you know, this very night, your life will be demanded of you.

405
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,360
 And it's actually interesting

406
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,560
 'cause the literal Greek says your soul,

407
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,160
 you know, before he says my soul.

408
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,240
 And then now he says that even our life,

409
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,040
 you know, something that we steward.

410
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,520
 And it will be demanded of you.

411
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,640
 And then he asked a question,

412
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,440
 and who will get what you have prepared for yourself?

413
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,640
 Who's going to have your stuff?

414
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:08,280
 And at this time, it just shows the emptiness,

415
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,840
 the spiritual bankruptcy with which he stands before God.

416
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,640
 You know, because that's not his question anymore.

417
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
 He has different concerns on it this time.

418
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,200
 He has different questions on it at this point.

419
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,840
 And then Jesus concludes by saying,

420
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,240
 you know, gives like a wisdom saying,

421
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,840
 he says this is how it will be

422
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,640
 with whoever stores up things for themselves,

423
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,040
 but is not rich towards God.

424
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,240
 And so there's a contrast.

425
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,760
 There's like storing up things towards yourself

426
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,040
 versus being rich towards God.

427
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,840
 And he's saying, you know, that's a consequence

428
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,480
 when we're just all about ourselves.

429
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,160
 When we try to find a security in possessions and wealth,

430
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,000
 when we try to find power, significance, influence,

431
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,960
 you know, whatever it is.

432
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,880
 For people, money means different things for people,

433
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,120
 possessions mean different things for people.

434
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,840
 And whatever it is that we're trying to find in it,

435
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,200
 it does not deliver if it's just direct towards ourself.

436
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,120
 So Jesus then concludes that, you know,

437
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,080
 this man made a disastrous investment.

438
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,640
 And actually kind of ends open-ended

439
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,800
 because we don't know what he does.

440
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,640
 We don't know what he says.

441
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,760
 Now, suddenly we don't hear his inner dialogue anymore.

442
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,200
 And actually it's meant for ourselves to think about,

443
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,120
 you know, what's inside of our, what's our inner dialogue?

444
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,680
 You know, what are we saying to ourselves?

445
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,520
 And so while the man in the parable

446
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,840
 didn't acknowledge God at all,

447
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,640
 many of us here, we actually do.

448
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,160
 Not all of us, but many of us here do.

449
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,560
 But nonetheless, we're not immune

450
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,960
 to the chasing after riches

451
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,160
 and trying to secure a future

452
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,520
 through the accumulation of wealth.

453
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,640
 We also believe that false narrative,

454
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,800
 even as Christians, right?

455
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,760
 That possessions, they're gonna solve our problems.

456
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,880
 They're gonna give us security

457
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
 so we can finally rest, not be anxious.

458
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,800
 Possessions are gonna give us significance.

459
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,680
 People are gonna listen to me.

460
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,400
 I'm gonna have influence.

461
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,760
 Possessions are gonna give us power

462
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,440
 so we can have an impact, you know, whatever it is.

463
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,040
 And we believe that.

464
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
 And they do to a certain degree.

465
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,800
 But in the end, they never fully deliver.

466
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,600
 And contrary to what Jesus says,

467
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,680
 that life does not consist in abundance of possession,

468
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,720
 we think it does.

469
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,680
 You know, we actually believe that it does.

470
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,280
 If you picture an abundant life, what do you picture?

471
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,160
 Exactly, right?

472
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,680
 And I have to be honest, I picture the same thing.

473
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,640
 But what Jesus is trying to bring a corrective,

474
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,720
 you know, to us.

475
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,200
 So money and possessions, they're idols.

476
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
 You know, they're idols of our heart.

477
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,240
 And Tim Keller, who was a well-known pastor in the US,

478
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,080
 he defines an idol this way.

479
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,120
 An idol is anything more important to you than God.

480
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,200
 Anything that absorbs your heart

481
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,840
 and imagination more than God.

482
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,000
 Anything you seek to give you what only God can give.

483
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,160
 And so in the parable, we see that this rich man,

484
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,840
 he is daydreaming.

485
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,600
 You know, his imagination is stirred by his possessions

486
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,440
 and by his wealth.

487
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,040
 And he dreams of how this will give him security,

488
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,840
 how this will give him a relaxing retirement.

489
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,720
 And, but it reveals, you know, that that's his idol.

490
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,360
 That's what he puts his faith really in.

491
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,280
 And I think with us, we've been talking about,

492
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,440
 there's a lot of theoretical in our Christian faith.

493
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,920
 We theoretically, you know, believe that

494
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,000
 abundant life is in God.

495
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,600
 But if we actually look at our life practice,

496
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,080
 we see a lot of times that we actually place our faith

497
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,000
 in other things.

498
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,720
 We actually place our faith in, you know, in our jobs

499
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,600
 or in our bank account or whatever it is,

500
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,840
 or your house that you own

501
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,080
 or working towards owning or whatever.

502
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,520
 And the man that came to Jesus, you know,

503
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,840
 with a request about his inheritance,

504
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,920
 he also thought that the inheritance

505
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,040
 is gonna deliver for him something, you know,

506
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,160
 whether it's that security again.

507
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,400
 And we all heard, or maybe even experienced personally

508
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,520
 yourself, like just horror stories of inheritance,

509
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,320
 you know, where there's horrible fighting,

510
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,440
 where relationships fall apart,

511
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,360
 where it's just brokenness and just destroys

512
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,720
 and devastates families.

513
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,560
 And again, it just shows that we hold this idol in our heart,

514
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,120
 you know, that we think this inheritance

515
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,440
 is gonna do something and we don't care about the relationship.

516
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,640
 We just wanna get ours, what we think is ours,

517
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,920
 and it doesn't matter if the relationship is destroyed.

518
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,480
 You know, and it's devastating.

519
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,760
 Now, what's interesting, when we think about greed,

520
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,920
 a lot of times we don't think of ourselves.

521
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,160
 Like I've heard several pastors say,

522
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,240
 "Nobody ever comes to me and confesses that they're greedy."

523
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,360
 You know, people share all sorts of things,

524
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,080
 you know, sexual brokenness, affairs,

525
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,120
 you know, broken relationships,

526
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,320
 whatever, you know, like having cheated someone,

527
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,680
 whatever it may be.

528
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,480
 But what this shows is that most of us

529
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,400
 actually don't think of ourselves as greedy.

530
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,600
 We don't think it's our issue,

531
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,920
 we think it's the other person's issue.

532
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,600
 And we can always find someone that we can point to, right?

533
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,280
 Can always find someone else where you can say,

534
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,840
 "Oh yeah, it's their issue, but it's not my issue."

535
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,640
 But here, Jesus, he's exposing these inner dialogues

536
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,600
 and things in our hearts.

537
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,560
 He's actually saying, "But actually it's all of our issue."

538
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,520
 You know, and Jesus is calling us

539
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,960
 to bring this issue to him

540
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,920
 so that we can overcome this issue

541
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,600
 by the power of Jesus in our lives,

542
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,160
 and that we can live lives that are rich towards God,

543
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,920
 not just rich towards ourselves.

544
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,880
 Now, I had a financial transaction

545
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,160
 that I was trying to,

546
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,880
 or like a business thing that I was trying to do,

547
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,080
 and it fell through in the last moment.

548
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,160
 And I was so angry.

549
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,520
 I'm a very relaxed person.

550
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,720
 I know a lot of you don't know me that well.

551
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
 I'm a very relaxed person.

552
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,680
 I don't get very angry most of the time.

553
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,960
 But I was super angry.

554
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,360
 And then as I suddenly realized my strong emotions,

555
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,520
 I was like, "Whoa, what's going on here?

556
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,000
 Why am I so upset?"

557
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,920
 And the truth is, you know,

558
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,280
 because I placed hope in this investment

559
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,720
 that it would do something for me

560
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,560
 that actually only God can do.

561
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,680
 You know, I thought this thing will bring me security.

562
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,920
 I thought this thing will bring me significance,

563
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,120
 but it doesn't.

564
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,440
 You know, that is only found in God,

565
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
 your significance, your security.

566
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,520
 And so when our faith is in other things besides God,

567
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,000
 it's hard to live a life that's rich towards God

568
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,280
 'cause we're trying to hold on to our possessions.

569
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,960
 You know, we can't be generous to other people

570
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,840
 because we think these possessions are significant.

571
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,160
 So we grab onto them and we can't hold them loosely.

572
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,320
 And also keeps us from doing a lot of times

573
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,520
 the things that Jesus asked us to do,

574
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,280
 which maybe there's a brother or sister

575
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,400
 he wants us to be generous to.

576
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,120
 But if we think this thing will secure us,

577
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
 we can't let it go.

578
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,080
 We can't be generous to that person.

579
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:35,000
 And Jesus, he wants to break the power

580
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,840
 of this grip of greed in our lives.

581
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,440
 He wants us to be free.

582
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,040
 Earlier, you were saying about freedom.

583
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,240
 So we can be free to love other people.

584
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,760
 We can be free to reflect a character of God,

585
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,520
 of generosity towards others.

586
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,120
 That it doesn't just have to be about ourselves

587
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,800
 and we don't have to direct all this wealth

588
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,960
 or whatever it is towards us.

589
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,360
 And by the way, this can be anyone.

590
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,320
 You can be rich or poor,

591
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,240
 and we still struggle with the same heart issue.

592
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,080
 You know, it's not about who has a lot

593
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,600
 or who doesn't have much.

594
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,640
 We all struggle with greed.

595
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,440
 It's a heart issue for all of us.

596
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,400
 And then Jesus, actually, we're not gonna read further,

597
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,960
 I'm gonna tell you what happens afterwards.

598
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,240
 He talks about not being anxious

599
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,320
 'cause our loving Father cares for us

600
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,160
 and to seek first his kingdom.

601
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,920
 And then all these things will be added unto you.

602
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,240
 And isn't that amazing that actually God promises us

603
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,000
 that when we are generous,

604
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,680
 when we live a life that's of love and serving our labors

605
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,560
 and making investments in the kingdom,

606
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,080
 that he will provide for us.

607
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,760
 He actually will give us what we need.

608
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,920
 It doesn't mean that he's gonna not give us a yacht

609
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,480
 or something like that,

610
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,440
 but he will provide for us what we need.

611
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,880
 He will take care of us.

612
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,360
 So seeking the kingdom,

613
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,640
 if we make that a priority in our lives,

614
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,720
 it means that we're willing to do God's will.

615
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,640
 And it means that we're following Jesus

616
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,800
 in all aspects of our lives.

617
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
 But if we're holding idols,

618
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,640
 how do they keep us from doing that?

619
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,040
 And so Jesus wants to free us

620
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,520
 so we can actually fully follow him,

621
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,160
 that we can fully live for him.

622
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,640
 And I just picture as a church,

623
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,880
 wouldn't it be amazing

624
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,280
 if we all just grow in seeking the kingdom

625
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,200
 and in obedience to Jesus and living generous lives

626
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,560
 and growing in generosity?

627
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,200
 I think it's a process a lot of times.

628
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,520
 It's not like most times,

629
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,680
 it's not just from one moment to the next

630
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,880
 that you completely change.

631
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,760
 What impact we as a community could have

632
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,880
 for God's kingdom would be amazing.

633
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,160
 I wanna see that.

634
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,000
 But in order to do that,

635
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,320
 we need faith and we struggle to trust God

636
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,400
 that he will care for us and that he will provide for us.

637
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,760
 So my sense for today is that Jesus wants to give us faith.

638
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,920
 That he actually wants to today release faith on us.

639
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,680
 He wants to give us trust

640
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,720
 so that we can courage us and live for him,

641
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
 that we don't have to live in fear.

642
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,240
 'Cause it's like we live by fear

643
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,480
 when we're holding on to possessions,

644
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,440
 we're living in fear.

645
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,600
 'Cause we think these things will deliver,

646
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,240
 but he's calling us to faith in him.

647
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,000
 That he loves you, he loves us,

648
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 he loves our heavenly father, loves his children.

649
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,640
 He will provide for us.

650
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,520
 As I was thinking about it,

651
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,680
 I was reminded of being in the US as a child.

652
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,200
 I couldn't swim.

653
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,480
 When I was a little kid,

654
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,600
 we were at some friends that lived in a apartment complex.

655
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,200
 They had a swimming pool

656
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,800
 like you know that people who live there can use.

657
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,000
 And so I remember like running and jumping

658
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,360
 in a swimming pool even though I couldn't swim.

659
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,960
 It's not a good idea, right?

660
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,040
 But the reason why I could do it

661
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
 was because my father was there.

662
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,640
 'Cause he caught me.

663
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,400
 Because I knew I could trust him,

664
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,280
 I could rely on him,

665
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,440
 I could take the step of faith,

666
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,320
 you know, and jump there

667
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,680
 because he would take care of me,

668
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,560
 would help me get back to the edge of the pool.

669
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,240
 I even went on the diving board,

670
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,640
 you know, and jumped in.

671
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,880
 But it was just because I knew my father had my back.

672
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,720
 And in a similar way,

673
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,960
 when we know just the father's love,

674
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,960
 when we know the saving love and care of Jesus in our lives,

675
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,320
 it frees us to be generous and loving towards others.

676
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,360
 You know, we can have that same type of faith

677
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,160
 where we can just dive in

678
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,760
 because we know he loves us,

679
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,000
 he will take care of us,

680
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,320
 we can be bold.

681
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,760
 But if we don't know his love,

682
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,600
 if we don't believe it,

683
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,280
 if we struggle to trust his heart.

684
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,720
 So I also believe that today God wants

685
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,720
 to reveal his love to us.

686
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,000
 You know, that the reality of his love

687
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,040
 can break over our lives.

688
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,720
 That we can start living differently,

689
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,640
 that we can start living generously,

690
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,280
 beautifully, abundantly,

691
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,520
 and be rich towards God

692
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,800
 and seek his kingdom first

693
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,520
 and make incredible investments in his kingdom

694
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:30,440
 and see God do things that have eternal,

695
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,400
 you know, consequences,

696
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,640
 that make an eternal difference.

697
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,200
 So how can I be rich towards God

698
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
 and invest,

699
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,360
 how can we be rich towards God

700
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,280
 and invest ourselves in what truly matters?

701
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,400
 I wanna invite the worship team to come up.

702
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,800
 How can we take the step of actually living

703
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,040
 in this radical generosity

704
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,320
 that Jesus calls us to,

705
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,360
 where we're not just about

706
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,200
 accumulating things for ourselves,

707
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,960
 but we're not living in fear,

708
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,880
 but where we can live in faith.

709
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,200
 How do we actually do that?

710
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,080
 Well, the first thing is,

711
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,680
 it's not about trying harder.

712
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,000
 You know, it's not about,

713
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,920
 I'm gonna try harder to be more generous

714
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,000
 and give a little and give a little of my time,

715
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 give a little of my energy,

716
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,920
 give a little bit of my money.

717
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,240
 No, it's actually acknowledging,

718
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,040
 it's surrendering to Jesus.

719
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,400
 It's like, I can't do this.

720
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,400
 And I need you.

721
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,080
 And it's also asking Jesus,

722
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,280
 I've been holding this idol in my heart

723
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,720
 that I think delivers what only you can give.

724
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,120
 Will you forgive me for this?

725
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,120
 And will instead, will you show me your love for me?

726
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
 Will you show me that you care for me,

727
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,800
 that you provide for me,

728
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,760
 that you will give me what I need?

729
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,400
 And then as that reality breaks over our lives,

730
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,320
 as the spirit of God makes that known to us,

731
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,760
 we can ask him, Lord,

732
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,480
 how do you want me to be generous this week?

733
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,400
 What do you want me to do?

734
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,480
 How can I show love towards people around me?

735
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,040
 Maybe how can I show love towards people

736
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,440
 here in this church community?

737
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,360
 How can I show love towards people in my family

738
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,880
 and outside, the wider Yuen Long community?

739
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,840
 And then when God reveals to you what to do,

740
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,200
 take the step of faith,

741
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,880
 you jump into the pool and you do it.

742
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,880
 And you trust that he will work through it,

743
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,920
 but you also trust that you're not gonna suffer loss

744
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,840
 because of it,

745
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,640
 but that you are gonna live a life

746
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,760
 that's rich towards God.

747
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,080
 So I wanna invite everyone to stand.

748
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,840
 I would love to pray over us.

749
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:56,080
 If, I wanna invite you to really think about right now,

750
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,040
 am I seeking his kingdom first

751
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,240
 or is there other things I'm seeking after?

752
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,720
 Am I seeking his kingdom first

753
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,960
 or are there other things I'm seeking after?

754
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:17,720
 And if you just say, Jesus, I wanna seek your kingdom,

755
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,760
 but I'm struggling to trust you that you are truly good,

756
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,600
 that you will truly deliver, that you will truly provide,

757
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,320
 I just wanna invite you to stretch out your hand

758
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,120
 as an expression of just openness to God

759
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,760
 and just a desire and a surrender to him.

760
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,480
 Like I wanna seek you, I wanna live for you.

761
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,960
 I don't want these idols to rule in my heart.

762
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,440
 I want you, Jesus, to rule my heart.

763
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,720
 And let me pray over you.

764
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,920
 Jesus, I thank you so much

765
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,480
 that you love us so incredibly much.

766
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,840
 Lord, you know all of our journeys.

767
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,440
 You know every single heart in this room.

768
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,400
 You know the things that we hold dear,

769
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,280
 that we think will provide for us, deliver things for us,

770
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,440
 give us security.

771
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,240
 But I just pray that everything is a lie

772
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,840
 that you expose that right now.

773
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,320
 That you help us instead to turn our hearts to you

774
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,880
 and place our faith and our trust in you.

775
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,920
 I ask Holy Spirit that you will come right now

776
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,000
 and reveal your love to us,

777
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,880
 the love of the Father who doesn't abandon his children,

778
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,160
 who doesn't give bad gifts, he gives good gifts.

779
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,120
 It's the Father that will add these things unto you

780
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,040
 when you live that radical life of generosity

781
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,280
 and radical life of faith, of following him,

782
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,120
 of doing the things Jesus calls us to do.

783
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,760
 Or will you pour out this faith

784
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,400
 and this courage in our hearts?

785
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:57,520
 Will you forgive us for greed where we failed you?

786
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,480
 But will you help us by your Spirit to live differently?

787
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,120
 Will you strengthen us by your grace?

788
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,120
 Will you help us to be people of faith, not people of fear?

789
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,200
 And we know that it's your Spirit's work.

790
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,320
 It's not we can't do this out of our own strength, Lord.

791
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,760
 So will you come right now,

792
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,760
 will you help us to be seekers of your kingdom

793
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,360
 as a community?

794
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,320
 I pray all this in your name, Jesus.

795
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,160
 Amen.

796
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,960
 Let's worship.

797
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,540
 (upbeat music)
