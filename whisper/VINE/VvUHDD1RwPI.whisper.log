[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   Everyone says, "Amen." Hey, can we thank our worship team as always? Thank you guys.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.120]   Have a seat, have a seat. We are absolutely over full. We've had to close
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.160]   the service and not let anyone more in, but we do have one or two space. So if
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.240]   you've now sat down and there's a space next to you, could you just put your hand
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.360]   up? There's a whole bunch of people standing around here that would like to
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.880]   get a seat. There's one seat right here. This is the upgrade seat. It's like
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.680]   first-class for you. Yes, there's a seat there. Come on in, come on in, have a seat
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.880]   right here. I'm trying to sell you my seat. There you go. It's a nice seat. There
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.560]   you go. Any other seats around, please put your hand up if you have a seat. We want
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.200]   to make sure that we can get as many people in as possible. Just a reminder,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.920]   once again, welcome to our 11 o'clock service. If you're relatively new to the
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.840]   Vine, we're so glad you're here. We do have a 9/15 service and a 2 o'clock
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.240]   service. There's a bit of room in those services, so we encourage you, if that
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.020]   works for your timing, to come to those services. We understand that there was a
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:11.200]   marathon today. Anyone run in the marathon today? Come on, yes! What did you
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.160]   do? Did you do like a 10k? 10k? Awesome. Anyone do a half marathon in the room?
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.120]   No, you're dead. You do the half marathon? Oh, you did one before? No, that doesn't
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.160]   count. Well done to you. All right. Well, my name is Andrew. Like I said, I'm one of
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.120]   the pastors, and it's great to have you with us. We have sent, at the start of
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.840]   this year, a call from God towards greater intimacy with Him. The sort of
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.240]   idea that, as much as we love gathering like this on a Sunday and coming into
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.880]   God's atmosphere and His presence here, and we'll continue to do this on a
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.720]   Sunday, that God has actually so much more for us. That coming into a community
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.200]   like this, into the atmosphere of God in a room like this, is not the end point of
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.240]   what God wants for you. It's actually the catalyst for you to push beyond just a
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.600]   feeling of God into a deeper and more personal intimacy with Him.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.640]   And that's everything that's on our heart for the Vine this year. And so this
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.120]   is your home church. If this is what you're a part of, we want to help
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.480]   facilitate in our times together this movement from just the atmosphere of God
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.920]   to a living and active faith with the very person of God. And last week, in
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.520]   week two, I mentioned that there are two critical traps. Really important you hear
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.840]   this. Two critical traps that Christians fall into when it comes to the intimacy
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.400]   of God, and that actually limits their ability to be in intimacy with God. Last
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.200]   week I spoke about the first of those traps, and it's the trap of building our
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.840]   relationship with God primarily on other people's opinions, other people's
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.360]   perspectives, other people's ideas, even other people's intimacy with God, that we
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.680]   end up building our relationship with Jesus not on a direct relationship with
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.920]   Him, but on everybody else's relationship with Him. Does that make sense? And what
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.480]   happens is we end up building this relationship with Jesus off of everybody
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.200]   else's perspectives and opinions by what we read, what we hear, what we download,
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.000]   what we whatever, and those things are good, of course. There's nothing wrong
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.200]   with learning from others. So much of our Christian faith is about learning from
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.120]   others, but when that is the primary posture of our relationship with Jesus,
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.680]   that we're only building a relationship with Him based on what everybody else
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.640]   says, then what ends up happening is what I said last week. You will end up
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.800]   worshiping a second-hand Jesus. You will end up having a borrowed faith. You're
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.920]   worshiping somebody else's experience of Jesus. And if we truly want to move into
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.240]   deeper intimacy with Him this year, what I said last week is resonant for us this
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:54.920]   week. We have to trade rumor of God for firsthand faith. See, rumor of God, other
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.520]   people's perspectives and opinions, is not intimacy, and we need to move from
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.360]   just rumor of God, as helpful as that can be for us, and as helpful as it can be
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.560]   for our theology, and great that it can be for us to learn and grow in Christ.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.720]   All of that is good, but we need to move from just rumor to firsthand faith. That
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.680]   was last week. That was the first critical trap. I want to talk today about
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.280]   the second critical trap that has the power to limit your ability to be in
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.040]   intimacy with Christ. And to introduce that to you, I need to talk to you about
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.480]   a funeral. I came on staff here at the Vine 15 years ago, and I came straight
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.240]   out of Bible school. I'd studied in Bible school. I'd had a career in banking prior
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.840]   to going to Bible school. At the age of 30, I went to Bible school for four years,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.160]   and then off the back of Bible school, I came here to the Vine and became a part
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.480]   of the pastoral team. And of course, back in those days, there was other senior
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.360]   pastors. Senior pastors John and Tony were leading the church at that time. In
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.640]   about the first month that I am on staff, an emergency funeral comes up. There is a
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.280]   shocking death within our community. Somebody passed away that nobody
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.660]   expected would happen, and it meant that we had to do this sudden funeral for
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.800]   this family. And it just so happened that John and Tony were not available to
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.600]   attend or to run this funeral, so the funeral came to me. And to tell you that
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.960]   I was terrified is an understatement, okay? Bible school is great. Bible school
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.440]   gives you a lot of information about God. It helps you to study the Word of God. I
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.320]   love my time in Bible school. What Bible school doesn't do is help you to prepare
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.800]   for a funeral, okay? Some people feel like it's their funeral at Bible school, but
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.760]   anyway, that's a whole different story. But it doesn't help prepare you to help a
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.000]   family walk through some of the hardest times of their lives. And so I was
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.440]   terrified. I was so green in my experience in this area, but I did all
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.920]   the right things, right? So I prayed about it. I met with the family, and we grieved
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.560]   together. We talked about how they wanted the memorial to go, the flow of the
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.400]   memorial. On the day of the memorial itself, my heart was beating really hard.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.560]   I was super sweaty and nervous. I was praying that only 20 people would show
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.640]   up, so it'd be nice and small and easy to handle. Over 300 people came to this
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.920]   particular memorial. This guy was well known in his company. He was
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.160]   well known in Hong Kong. And so there was a lot of people there at the memorial,
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.800]   and I did a terrible job through the memorial. But it got to the point of the
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   eulogies, and we had arranged that four people were going to give a eulogy about
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.080]   this person. And those four people were friends and colleagues of him and family
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.040]   as well. And so each person got up and did what a eulogy is supposed to do,
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.640]   right? They get up, and they talked about their relationship with this person. And
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.960]   as people were talking, and they were so beautiful, these eulogies, so articulate.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.320]   Every single person just did a phenomenal job in doing these eulogies.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.400]   But I noticed along the way that there was a pattern to what I was hearing in
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.280]   the eulogies. And the pattern was that everybody was speaking about all of the
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.760]   things that this person had done for them. And they were just so overwhelmed
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.600]   with gratitude for what this person had done in their lives. For some, it had been
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.520]   that he had been their mentor in the office and had helped them to get
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.960]   promotions through the company. For others, it was generosity. This person had
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.360]   been super generous to them, and they had received that generosity and were so
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.400]   grateful for it. For others, it was just the benefits of receiving hospitality in
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.320]   their home and welcoming them into the home. Every single person talked about
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.200]   all the amazing things that this guy had done for them, had benefited them with,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.880]   had blessed them with, or some of the crazy great achievements that he had
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.840]   done in the world. And I sat there, and I thought to myself, "This is what I want at
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:51.280]   my funeral." I thought, "How amazing would it be if whenever it is that I die, that
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.560]   a whole bunch of people gather in a room and talk about all the
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.520]   things that I had done for them, all the things that I had achieved for them, all
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   the things that I had blessed them with, that I had done for them on their
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.360]   behalf, my generosity, my love, my support, my prayers, whatever it might be. I was
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.360]   like, "This is what surely you would want at a funeral." Well, after the four eulogies
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:18.120]   had finished, the wife gets up. And as she gets up and walks towards the
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.800]   microphone, the whole room was just totally silent. And there was this huge
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.160]   amount of respect in the room for what this woman was going through. And she
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.120]   gets and stands there in front of everybody, and for ages she doesn't say
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:39.560]   anything. She's just overwhelmed with emotion, which you can understand. And you
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.400]   can see the emotion in her face. And this went on for quite some time, and I was
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.080]   at the point where I was thinking, "Do I need to get up and come alongside
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.200]   of her and help her?" And just as I'm kind of thinking that maybe that's what I
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.920]   need to do, she moves her hand up towards the microphone, and her hand is shaking
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.520]   because she's so emotional. And the sense I had was she had a prepared speech, but
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.000]   she doesn't want to give the prepared speech. And she grabbed the microphone,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:21.160]   and she said this. She said, "I just miss him. I just miss him." And it was like the
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.880]   perfect thing to say, because everybody else had said that they had missed what
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:31.120]   he had done for them. They missed his hospitality, or his generosity, or the
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.120]   fact that he was a mentor for them. And no doubt that this woman had received
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.960]   more from her husband than anyone else. She had received more benefit, more
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.360]   provision. He had done some amazing things for her and her family, I'm
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.320]   absolutely sure. But she stood before everybody, and she said, "You want to know
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:56.080]   the one thing? I just miss him. Not the things of him, not the activities
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.640]   that he did, not all the great achievements that he made in his life. I just miss
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:11.600]   being with him." And in that moment, I saw a picture of what true intimacy is,
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.800]   because everybody else in that room had a relationship with this person, but that
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:22.040]   room, that woman in the room, she was the one who was intimate with him. And she
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:30.360]   just missed him. And as we start this year of intimacy here at the Vine, I
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.520]   think there's an absolutely critical question that we all need to sit with
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:41.440]   and wrestle with, and it's this, that in your relationship with God, is it built
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:48.160]   on the things of God, or on the person of God? Say that again. Is your relationship
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.600]   with God, as you start this year, largely, primarily built on the things of God, or
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:00.680]   on the person of God? Because let's be honest with ourselves, the wonderful
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.520]   thing about being a Christian is that we get to worship our God. That he's a God
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.320]   who's a good father, who loves to pour out his blessings on his people. He loves
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.360]   to fill us with his gifts, and his spirit, and his love, and his goodness. We just
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.160]   sung that song. He's been good to us. We love the reality that we worship a God
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.760]   who, out of the kindness and the generosity of his heart, wants you to
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.400]   flourish as best you can in your life. He wants to come along and bless you,
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.480]   and secure you, and grow you, and do all the things that he can do to make your
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:36.880]   life the best thing that it can ever be. But here's the reality, when that is so
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.000]   much the focus of our relationship, that we build our relationship with God on
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.600]   the things that he does for us, you put yourself at the center of that
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.440]   relationship. It's then becoming a little bit more about you than it is about him,
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:59.280]   and secondly, your emotions are actually now linked, not to the person of God, but
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:06.320]   to what he does for you. Follow this. I found this so much in my life. There was
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.960]   a season where I realized that if God was blessing me, if God was answering my
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.680]   prayers, if he was coming through for me in the ways that I was hoping he would
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:21.760]   come through for me, then I felt loved and accepted by him. But in the seasons
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.040]   where it goes a bit silent, in the seasons where the blessings weren't
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.520]   there, in the seasons where it felt like God was quite distant from me, I was
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:36.600]   disappointed and angry, and I felt lack of intimacy with him. Are you with me? And
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.400]   the reality is, for all of us, when we're in this kind of approach in our
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.120]   relationship with God, we have to wrestle with the reality that so often we
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.360]   actually build the foundation of whether we're loved or accepted by God by what
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:57.320]   he does for us, rather than just purely who he is. And what ends up happening for
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.280]   all of us is that our intimacy with God is actually not an intimacy with him, but
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:07.880]   it's an intimacy with the things of him. When your intimacy is built on the
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:19.280]   things of God and not God himself, that is idol worship. God had to come to me a
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.240]   few years ago in one of my quiet times and say this to me. He said, "Would you
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:34.360]   rather have me or my blessings?" I think that's a deeply challenging question.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:40.880]   Would you rather have me or my blessings? And I find this deeply challenging
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.840]   because I know from my own personal life that I am attracted to the burning bush,
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.720]   but often I don't see beyond the flames to the God behind the bush. I'm attracted
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.220]   to the benefits of God. I'm attracted to the things of God, what God can do for me,
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.280]   the blessings that come upon me, the things that I know that his
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.680]   mighty hand can provide for me. I'm attracted to those things, and I find
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.520]   myself drawing near to God because of my attraction to the benefits of being in
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.440]   relationship with God, but I find myself rarely taking off my sandals and stepping
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.160]   on the holy ground and communing with him. And when that's the case, we've got
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.240]   an issue. And I think this is not just my problem, I think it's our problem. And I
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.160]   think in a year of intimacy with him, we have to wrestle with this reality deep
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:36.840]   inside each one of us. It's easy for us to be attracted to the benefits of God,
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:42.440]   but when your primary intimacy with him is based out of what he does or doesn't
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:49.720]   do for you, your relationship with him will be like this all the time. And Paul
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:55.000]   would write to the church, and he would say, "I know what it is to be hungry, and I
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.040]   know what it is to be fed. I know what it is to be shipwrecked, and I know what it
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.120]   is to be safe. I know what it is to be wealthy, I know what it is to be poor. I've
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.920]   experienced the blessings, and I've experienced the seasons without the
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.040]   blessings, but I have learned the secret of being content. No matter what might be
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.360]   happening, no matter what God might be doing, no matter what blessings or not
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.320]   blessings might happen in my life, I've learned what it is to be intimate with
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.040]   him because I'm not basing the relationship that I have on Jesus by
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:30.920]   what Jesus does for me." I think we all have to recognize that the reality for
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:39.880]   many of us is that we want more from God, but not necessarily more of God. Come on
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:46.000]   church. Hi. Everybody okay? We have this thing where we want more from God, what
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.840]   he can do for us, but we don't necessarily want more of God, our
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.360]   relationship with him, and we're happy to have all the benefits of relationship
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:01.280]   with Jesus without any of the responsibility. A few years ago, my
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:10.480]   absolute singular obsession in life was to get to silver class on Cathay Pacific.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:17.840]   It was my absolute obsession to get from the green card that you get when you
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:25.040]   just buy a ticket to the silver card. Oh sweet Jesus on high, if you could just
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:32.480]   get me lounge access, I would love Cathay for the rest of my life. That would be
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.880]   amazing. Now I recognize some of you in this room watching online in the
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:42.800]   overflow, you have diamond status with Cathay Pacific. I recognize that. You have
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.360]   diamond status, yes, because you fly a lot, but you also have diamond status because
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.120]   you probably work for a large multinational company that buys your
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:56.720]   tickets in business class at the highest amount of price possible so that you can
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.000]   have the greatest amount of flexibility possible, which means you earn the most
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.480]   miles possible and the biggest sector points possible, and it's the sector
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:09.640]   points that actually help you to get the status. However, I work for a church, and
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.640]   you, if you tithe here at the Vine, you'll be very happy to know that if I could
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:23.600]   fly in cargo class, the church would put me in cargo class, okay? I am so far back
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.640]   in economy, they basically should just put me in a suitcase, okay? My secretary,
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.760]   Veronica, she is phenomenal at finding the cheapest economy class fares on Cathay
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.360]   Pacific that is absolutely possible, and from a governance perspective, for all of
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.520]   you, that's a really good thing, but what it means for me is that it's really hard
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.680]   to earn sector points and miles on Cathay Pacific when you pay peanuts, you
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:52.760]   get monkeys, okay? And so for two years, I had this obsession that I was gonna get
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.480]   myself to silver status, you know? And so every flight I took, whether personal or
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.000]   with work, I was on Cathay Pacific. I actually got one of the American Express
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.280]   Cathay Pacific cards so that every time I went to a restaurant, I earned more
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.160]   points. If you could have flown Cathay from Kowloon to Central, I would have
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:19.840]   flown Cathay Pacific. I didn't particularly like Cathay Pacific more
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:26.040]   than any other airline. Sorry, Ken. Ken's in the overflow. I love you, Ken. It was
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.120]   just, it was our national carrier. It was the easiest airline and it was having
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:35.880]   the best benefits, and I cannot describe to you what the moment was like when I
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:41.480]   got the letter in the mail with the silver card inside it. Oh, ladies and
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.840]   gentlemen, you know it comes with a little tag that you're supposed to
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.680]   put on your luggage. Nobody puts the tag. I put the tag on my luggage. I wanted
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.480]   everybody in the airport to know that I had earned my silver status on Cathay
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.320]   Pacific. I remember the first flight, the next flight I was on Cathay, I remember
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.280]   going to Kai Tak, no it was Chet Blackcock, I went to Chet Blackcock. I was there
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:08.920]   four hours early because I'm gonna make that buffet pay in the lounge. I went
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.600]   into that lounge with my silver card out like super proud. I'm like, where is the
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.680]   food? Give me the food. I dominated that food. I basically paid back for two years
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:25.600]   of flights on that buffet alone. Well, you can probably guess what happens. A year
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:32.840]   later, I haven't flown enough to keep my status on Cathay Pacific. A year later, I
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:38.800]   get a mail and the letter says, "Hey, congratulations, you are green card now."
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.760]   And I'm like, hang on a sec. After spending all those years and time and
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.160]   energy and everything I did on Cathay Pacific to get myself into the lounge
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.600]   with my silver card, then I didn't fly enough in that year post that to earn
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.200]   enough miles to stay in that status. And suddenly I dropped down to green and
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.120]   basically Cathay was dead to me. I wasn't interested in Cathay after that. I
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.640]   couldn't care less, whatever. They're not gonna treat me well, then I am not
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.960]   bothered. Here's the point. Some of you in this room, you are on a frequent flyer
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.000]   program with God and you're wondering why you're struggling to find intimacy
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.720]   with Him. Because your whole relationship with Him is based on the benefits of
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.680]   being in relationship with Him. And when those benefits are good, you're super
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.520]   happy. You're happy to fly God Airlines when things are going well for you. But
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.960]   when things don't go well, particularly when you thought you earned the miles,
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.520]   but the miles were not actually enough. When you thought you put on all that
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.480]   spiritual work to get yourself into a better relationship with Him. When you
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.600]   thought you had prayed harder for that thing than you had prayed for anything
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:48.960]   else and yet God didn't answer that prayer, you want a discount. You struggle
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.160]   and we struggle with this up-and-down relationship with God based surely on
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.560]   all of this process. And we have to recognize that when we base our
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.920]   relationship with God on the benefits of God, we've stepped into idolatry. I
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.440]   would say it this way. The greatest idolatry in the church today is the
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:12.840]   idol worship of the benefits of God. It is seeking God or pursuing Him primarily
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:18.640]   for what He can do for us rather than simply for who He is. It is mistaking
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:26.080]   blessing for intimacy. There's nothing wrong with the blessings of God. Don't
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.280]   hear me wrong today. There's nothing wrong with the fact that God loves to
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.120]   pour out His love. He wants to pour out Himself to you. His blessings are
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:41.200]   abundant for you. But when we get seduced by the blessings of God and we allow
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.640]   that to become the primary focus for us, the primary thing that helps us to feel
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.240]   whether we're in relationship with God or not, helps us to feel whether God is
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.320]   pleased with us or not. I'm gonna preach on this one for a second.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.480]   There's some of us here, and I put myself in this camp sometimes, where we
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.440]   actually put our whether God is pleased with us or not based on
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.200]   whether we receive His blessings or not. You need to understand that the blessings
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.600]   of God are not the marker of whether God is pleased with you, nor is it actually
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.320]   the proof that you're in a good relationship with Him. In fact, there are
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.640]   many examples in the Bible where because of God's generosity and because of God's
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.480]   love and because of how God sees His people, He's pouring out His blessings
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.240]   when His people are far from Him. When His people couldn't care less. When His
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.840]   people aren't in some intimate relationship with Him, God is still blessing them. We
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.320]   saw this recently in our Exodus series. If you're a part of the Vine over the
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.240]   last year, we went through the book of Exodus, and we saw there that there was
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.960]   this moment where because of their unfaithfulness, Israel's unfaithfulness,
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.440]   because they didn't trust God with the promised land, God made them wander in
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.460]   the desert for 40 years. God wasn't pleased with them in that moment. There
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.880]   wasn't this deep relationship that God had freed them out of
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.080]   their slavery for in that moment. Israel was walking in the opposite spirit. They
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.720]   were actually worshipping other idols in the land at that time. But every single
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:08.320]   day of those 40 years, God in His miracle working heart blessed them with manna
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:13.560]   from heaven that kept them alive. Every single day. Every single day He poured out the
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.960]   blessings of God on His people, even when their relationship was not in a healthy
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:22.720]   place. And some of us here, we are basing the health of our relationship with God
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.280]   on whether we're receiving His blessings or not. And if you do that, you're gonna
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.880]   have a very difficult time of being intimate with Him. There's gonna be some
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.600]   challenges for you, because there will be seasons where you will feel those
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:44.440]   blessings, but there will also be seasons when you don't. And your intimacy, and
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.040]   whether God is pleased with you, or whether even you're in a right
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.160]   relationship with Him, is not because He's answering your prayers, or He's
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.960]   giving you that promotion at work, or He's helping solve that thing in your
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:05.440]   family. It's simply because He loves you. He loves you. And your intimacy with Him
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.160]   cannot be based on what He does or doesn't do for you in your perspective.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:19.200]   It has to be based in who He is, regardless of what might happen for you.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.200]   This is not a new issue for the church. So if we are struggling with this, well,
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.480]   it's not a new issue. In fact, in the Gospel of John, in roundabout chapter 6,
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.880]   there is this amazing moment where Jesus does this incredible miracle. He's up on
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.600]   a mountain, and He's just taught the people, and the Sea of Galilee is just in
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.400]   front. And the people have been there all day, listening to Him teach. And the
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.280]   disciples come to Him and say, "Hey, the people are hungry, and we can't send them
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.240]   away without any food." And Jesus says, "Well, what have you got?" And they say, "Well,
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.080]   we've only got a couple of loaves and fishes." Jesus takes them, He prays for
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.880]   them, He blesses them. The disciples start handing them out, and they feed the
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:59.040]   whole 5,000 people. Just these little bit of resource in God's hands can achieve so
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:04.080]   much. And God, through Jesus, sends out His blessing to all of these 5,000 people.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.600]   Some of them who were poor people that were living in the Galilee area at that
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.760]   time, who probably hadn't had a big meal that whole week. People who are
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.560]   vulnerable and poor, they're now being fed by just a few loaves and a few fishes.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:21.360]   And God's heart for blessing is so abundant and so outpouring that the Bible
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.240]   tells us that leftovers were there after everybody had said, "Well, hobo, I can't
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.680]   take any more," right? Everybody said, "I am totally stuffed." There's still
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.760]   leftovers there because God is saying, "This is my heart for pouring out my
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.400]   blessings. I will pour them out so much of my people that there will be even an
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.280]   abundance and leftover from those blessings." It's a beautiful thing. The
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:47.320]   next day, perhaps not surprisingly, the people who had been fed the day before,
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:53.080]   they show up back where Jesus had been the day before because they want to get
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:26:00.320]   fed again. They want to experience that again. But interestingly, Jesus is not
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.760]   there. Let me pick up the story at that point. Is this helping some people here?
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:12.760]   No. Okay. Matthew, John chapter 6, starting in verse 24. So when the crowd saw that
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.560]   neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.800]   across the Capernaum to look for him there. They found him on that other side
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   of the lake and they asked, "Rabbi, when did you get here? Like, what's going on?
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   We're trying to find you. When did you get here?" Verse 26, Jesus replied, "I tell you
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.520]   the truth. You want to be with me because I fed you, not because you understood
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:41.240]   the miraculous signs." Jesus sometimes didn't win friends or influence people.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.160]   Sometimes Jesus got right to the heart of the matter. And all these crowds showed
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.360]   up again and they're like, "Where have you been, Jesus? We've been looking for you.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.760]   We want to be with you." And he's like, "The only reason we want to be with me is
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.360]   because I fed you yesterday, but you didn't see beyond the burning bush to
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.080]   the God that's behind the flames. You didn't understand the miraculous sign
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.760]   that was there, that this is actually not about the fact that I can feed your
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.200]   stomachs for a few hours. It's about the fact that God is present with you, that
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.600]   the Messiah has come, that you're being welcomed into a new relationship that
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.160]   will change your heart and change your life." Jesus is saying, "You got to see
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.560]   behind the blessings, but what's happened is you've gotten so focused on the
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.560]   blessing that you've forgotten about the blesser. You're so into the gift that
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.480]   you're not even thinking about the giver. And you just want to come to me because
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.640]   I'm giving to you and you're coming to me dependent on what I'm giving to you
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.400]   and he's saying, "You've got to see bigger than that." This is really important
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.280]   because I think it picks up on a point that resonates for so many of us and
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:46.600]   it's this. When we're obsessed with the blessings of God and we're building
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.960]   our intimacy with him primarily on what he does or doesn't do for us, that is
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:59.000]   primarily a self-centered way of being. That's about what God can do for me.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.520]   Let me make this really clear. God does not exist so you can use him. Jesus is not a
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.520]   good luck charm that you wear around your neck to get a couple of blessings
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:17.120]   this week. Selfishness sits at the very heart of why we want more from God than
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:23.320]   more of God. Selfishness, self-centeredness. If you want to deepen
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.080]   your intimacy with God this year, that's something to pray about. That's something
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:32.240]   to come around and say, "Where is the selfishness, self-centeredness in me when
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.400]   it comes to my relationship with him?" It's really important you understand that
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:42.800]   Jesus died so that he would deliver us from a self-centered life and bring us
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:48.360]   into a God-centered life. That's why Jesus went to the cross. That's the
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.840]   biggest blessing that there could ever be. The reality of our salvation in him,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.160]   the forgiveness of our sins, so that we would reorientate our lives away from
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:04.880]   "Give me, give me, give me" to "How do I serve? How do I honor? How do I worship? How do
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.360]   I adore? How do I give my whole self to the fact that now my life revolves
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.680]   around God, whereas before God was revolving around me?" And if I'm honest
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.120]   with you here at the Vine, I would say for some of us in this room watching
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.560]   online right now, in the overflow, for some of us we're in the center and God
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:28.880]   is revolving around us. That's not intimacy. That's self-centered idolatry.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:37.160]   Jesus says this to them. He says, "Don't be so concerned about perishable things like
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.800]   food. Spend your energy seeking the eternal life that the Son of Man can
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.240]   give you. For God the Father has given me the seal of his approval." In other words,
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.640]   if we're going to talk about blessings, Jesus is saying to the crowd, if we're
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.240]   going to talk about blessings, let's actually not focus on temporal blessings
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.080]   that help for a moment. Let's talk about eternal blessing. Let's talk about the
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.720]   real blessing that matters. The one about you and your soul. The one about your
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.640]   relationship for eternity. The one that's going to form and shape you forever.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.360]   Let's get our hearts focused on the eternal and off of just the temporal.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.880]   Again, not that God doesn't care about your temporal situation. Not that he
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.080]   doesn't want to pour out his heart in you. Not that he doesn't want to bless
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.000]   you. Of course he does, but he doesn't want your focus to be so much on the
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   immediacy of a blessing that you miss the longevity of your relationship with
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.280]   him. Notice how the people reply. The crowds reply. This was not what they were
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.920]   expecting to hear. They replied in verse 28, "We want to perform God's works too, so
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:43.200]   what should we do?" This is always the inevitable result that happens when we
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.520]   have a self-centered and mostly a benefits of God relationship with him.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.080]   Here's what will always happen. We will always want to take control of those
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.960]   benefits. We will always want to shape our lives around those benefits, and in
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.680]   order to do that, we will try to grasp a hold of them. We will try to get those
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:03.880]   benefits in our hands. They turn to Jesus and they say, "Tell us what we need to do
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.600]   to be able to do the things that you've done for us. We want to take the
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.400]   blessings of God, and we want to be the ones that are in control of those
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.480]   blessings. We want to be the ones that can feed ourselves and our families
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   whenever we want to. We want to be able to bless our community." And there was
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.220]   probably some good in their hearts when they were saying this to Jesus, but their
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.360]   thinking is faulty because they're basing it off of this kind of
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.320]   reciprocal sort of relationship with God, rather than a relationship with him which
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.080]   just puts him first. And they're saying, "Okay, how do we get the ability to
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.000]   control these things?" In other words, they're basically saying, "How do we earn
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.880]   the miles? What do we need to do? What's the credit card we need to get? What's
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.200]   the flights that we need to book? How do we get ourselves up on status with you,
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:54.600]   God, so that we can do the things that you do?" Jesus says this in response. Verse
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.320]   29, "Jesus told them, 'This is the only work God wants for you.'" I'm gonna read that
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:04.560]   again. "This is the only work that God wants from you. Believe in the one he has
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.240]   sent." In other words, the only thing he wants from you is to believe in him, to
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:15.400]   connect with him, to have relationship with him. Does he want to bless you?
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.720]   Absolutely he does. Does he want to pour out his gifts into your life? A hundred
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.520]   percent. Are those gifts good for you? Yes, they are. Do they change our relationship
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.480]   with him in some ways? Do we feel his closeness to us when we receive those
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.940]   gifts? Of course we do. But what Jesus is trying to do for the crowds, I think what
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.240]   he's trying to do for us, is elevate us into a different plane where our
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.720]   relationship is not dependent on whether we feel like we're being blessed by
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.640]   God, but our relationship is simply in the belief, in the confession, in the
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:46.400]   repentance, in the living out of an honest and real relationship with Jesus.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.480]   When we can echo with Paul, "I know what it is to be this, and I know what it is
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.200]   to be that, but I have found the secret of being content," that we could echo with
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:03.560]   that woman at the funeral and say, "I just miss him. I just miss him. Not all the
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:11.560]   things he did for me, him." If my wife, Chris, gave me a gift, which she does every
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:16.720]   once in a while, she gave me a gift and I took that gift and I threw it away just
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   to focus on her, I wouldn't be honoring her in the giving of that gift. And so
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.160]   when God blesses you, he's not asking you to throw it away and ignore it. His
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.560]   blessings are good for you. Does that make sense? And you receiving those blessings
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.280]   and walking in those blessings in your life is a way of honoring and worshiping
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   him. Equally though, if my wife gave me a gift and I was like, "I am so in love with
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.360]   this gift that I walk away from her, that I make all my time and my effort, my
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.080]   passion on the gift, and I don't even think about the person who gave me that
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.600]   gift," then that is also equally wrong. Are you with me? Both of those extremes are
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.880]   wrong, and the reality is, as Christians, we so live often between one of those
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:59.720]   two extremes. But what if my wife gave me a gift and I was so honored by that and
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.760]   I loved the gift and I enjoyed the gift, but then I allowed that gift not to make
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.640]   me self-centered in who I am and walking off and ignoring her, but actually using
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:14.560]   that gift to fill me with a greater love, a greater desire, a greater need to be
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.400]   intimate with her, and to realize that the gift is not the sum total of who she is
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.880]   for me, but it's just the catalyst that can bring me out of myself back to her
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.720]   in relationship with her. Are you with me? It's about getting the direction of God's
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:33.160]   blessings. Some of you, in action from this message, all you need to do is
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:38.000]   reorientate your thinking about the blessings of God. They are not a sign of
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.600]   whether He's pleased with you or not. They're an ability for you to connect
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:46.320]   better with Him, to not take it all into the gift and think the gift is everything,
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   but to allow the gift to move... Another way of saying it is, God's gifts are not
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.760]   gods, but they are gods. All right, that's tricky in English. Have a look at it on
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.800]   the screen here. God's gifts in your life are not deities. They're not gods to be
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.400]   worshipped, but they are gods. They are an expression of His character, of His
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.880]   goodness, and how much He loves you, and when you get that in the right balance,
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.800]   when you stop worshipping the benefits of God and actually start to worship Him,
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.880]   realizing that those benefits and those gifts are a trigger for you to be in
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.840]   deeper and more personal relationship with Him, you come to realize that the
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.920]   gifts are actually not bad, not something you should throw away. They're triggers
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:31.200]   for you to connect with Him more. They're invitations for you to find Him, and in
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.840]   the seasons where you don't have those gifts, it's not like He's not inviting
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.880]   you to be intimate with Him. He's just letting you know that His intimacy and
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:43.040]   your intimacy with Him is not dependent on what He does for you every single day.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:51.120]   I love the way that Psalm 37 verse 4 puts it. It says this, it says, "Delight
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.600]   yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart." Notice
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.200]   the order there. It doesn't say, "Delight in the desires of your heart and all
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:04.120]   that God has done for you, and then try to find Him." It's saying, "Delight in the
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.520]   Lord with all of your heart, mind, soul, and strength, and then everything else
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:11.280]   will be there." It's like Jesus in Matthew 6. He says those amazing things. He says,
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.640]   "Seek first the kingdom of God, and everything else will be added to you.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.520]   Everything else will be given to you. I want to give you all those things, but
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:22.840]   seek first me." Here's the reality. When our intimacy is based primarily with the
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.840]   benefits of God, here's what happens. We end up seeking the blessings of God in
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.960]   hope that we would, through receiving the blessings, actually find God. But it's the
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.160]   other way around. We need to seek God, and in finding God, we will come to receive
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:45.440]   His blessings. Do you follow that? I think so often we seek the blessing as a
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.800]   defining characteristic of who God is. We think we're going to find God out of
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:56.400]   the blessing. God is saying, "Seek me first, and all these other things will be
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:05.800]   added unto you. I just miss Him." There's another beautiful psalm. I'll close with
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.200]   this. This is a beautiful psalm. Psalm 131, verse 2. I want to read this to you,
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.320]   because this is really important. "Instead, I have calmed and quieted myself," the
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.520]   psalmist writes, "like a weaned child who no longer cries for its mother's milk.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:22.760]   Yes, like a weaned child is my soul within me." He's talking about his soul,
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:30.520]   and he's saying, "I've matured. I've grown up, and my soul is now weaned before you,
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:35.720]   and in that place, I find myself at rest. I find myself with you like I've never
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   found you before." It's a beautiful picture here of a child, and in the
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.840]   picture, there's a child nursing with its mother. If you're a mother in
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.600]   this room, or if you've been a mother in this room, you'll know what this is like.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.520]   When you've got a child who's nursing at your breast, the child knows that that's
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.200]   where it goes to for its milk. If the child is near you, it starts
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.300]   screaming. It starts crying out. It wants its milk. It wants its provision. Its
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.640]   primary relationship with its mother at that point when it's nursing is, "This
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   mother can do something for me." When the mother doesn't do that, it screams,
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.840]   it cries, it lashes out. Nesamus is using that as a picture, and he's saying,
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.400]   "I want to be a nursed child. I want to be a weaned child, sorry, not a nursing child
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.960]   when it comes to God. I want to be one who finds myself still and alive in Him
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.640]   because I'm not kicking and screaming when God doesn't do what I want
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.320]   God to do. I want to find myself quiet and at rest, knowing that just like a
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.560]   weaned child, I can crawl up to my mother." This is what a weaned child does. "Comes to
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:40.120]   its mother now," and the child trusts the mother. It's not kicking and screaming
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.200]   anymore. It trusts that the mother will provide at the right time. It wants to
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.480]   just be with its mother for the comfort and security of lying in its mother's
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:53.000]   arms, no longer screaming for the milk from the breast. Nesamus is pulling all
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.760]   this picture together, and he's saying this, "You need to wean yourself." Last week I
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.160]   spoke about gleaning. This week I'm finishing talking about weaning. Some of
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.880]   you in this room, you need to wean yourself off of your codependency for
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:17.640]   the blessings of God. You need to go from a nursing child with God to a weaned
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.920]   child who can say, "It is all right with my soul, whether God does anything else
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.440]   for me ever again, whether He answers a prayer or not, whether He comes through
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:32.040]   or not, and I hope He does, and I really hope He does, but the reality is my whole
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.680]   relationship with Him is not dependent on what He's going to do for me. It is
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.920]   dependent on the fact that He is just who He is, and I trust Him. I trust that
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.240]   He will nurture me, care for me, provide for me, answer the prayers. I trust that,
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.320]   but I'm not gonna kick and scream, get angry when it doesn't feel like it's
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:53.600]   happening, because I am weaned from Him and that dependency of being on those
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:58.520]   things. I am not connected to them in a codependency state. Does that make sense
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:05.920]   to you?" And so I want to invite you, if this is a year of intimacy for you, this
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:12.320]   is a year of freedom, and the blessings of God are good and great, and we should
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.360]   hunger for them and desire them, absolutely, but may we not build our
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.520]   relationship with God based on what we do or do not receive from Him. May we
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.800]   build our relationship with Him, finding ourselves quietened in our soul before
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:36.160]   Him, because we just want Him. That, my friends, is true intimacy. Shall we pray?
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:50.200]   Let's pray. Father, I thank you for each person here. Father, I thank you for your
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:57.480]   love, and I thank you that you see them, and I thank you, Lord, that your heart is
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:05.720]   a good father, and that you long to pour out your blessings, your gifts, and there
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:09.160]   are so many great benefits of being in relationship with you. Lord, we are so
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:17.640]   grateful that we worship you and not some other idol in our lives. We thank
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.920]   you for the blessings that you pour out so abundantly that there are leftovers
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.800]   at a feast. We thank you that you pour out those blessings on us abundantly
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:33.840]   with a generous wrist. But Lord, we ask that you would forgive us. Forgive us
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.360]   where we've taken the good things of God and we've turned them into God's
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:42.520]   themselves. Forgive us where at times we've become codependent on the
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:48.360]   blessings. Forgive us where we've made the blessings the signal to us, the
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:54.560]   barometer of our health, of our relationship with you. Forgive us where
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:05.860]   those blessings have become more important to us than simply you. Lord, if
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:12.400]   we're in this room watching online in the overflow and we know that our
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:20.320]   intimacy with you is primarily based on what we receive from you, Lord, we pray for
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:25.720]   maturity for us this year. We pray that you would mature this church, you would
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:35.720]   mature each person here. You would help us to find Paul's words echoing in our
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.920]   hearts. I have learned the secret of being content whether there are
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:53.000]   blessings or not. I just want him. Take a moment for yourself now. Just a moment
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:00.420]   between you and God. Off the back of everything I've been sharing, how does he
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:09.440]   want to speak to you today? What is it that you might need to confess? How is
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:16.140]   your relationship built with him? I believe he wants to draw near to you now
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:21.840]   and just have a conversation directly with you. And so we're gonna make some
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:27.200]   space for that before we respond together in worship. So take some time.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:36.560]   Just quiet in your heart. Bring your soul to him. Ask him to speak to you.
