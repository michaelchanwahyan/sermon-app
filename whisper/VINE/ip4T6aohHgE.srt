1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
 And Lord, I wanna pray for every heart in this room

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,920
 who has faithfully just prayed that prayer before you.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,200
 I wanna pray a release right now in the name of Jesus

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,960
 and a release through this message

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
 of anything that will hold them back.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,540
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,680
 Everyone says, hey, can we thank our worship team

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,240
 as always, thanks guys so much.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,920
 Have a seat.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,680
 So last week we had Vision Sunday here at the Vine.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,840
 So if this is your first Sunday with us

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,800
 or if you weren't able to be with us last week,

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,740
 we know that a lot of people travel and things like that.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,860
 So you're welcome back.

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,340
 We did Vision Sunday last week

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,960
 where we released really to you as a church

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,560
 the sense of what we are kind of feeling

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,200
 that God is saying about us as a church community

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,400
 here in Hong Kong in this time.

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,520
 And really a word that we believe

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,160
 is gonna sit over us as a church

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,080
 over the rest of this year

23
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,640
 and probably into the year to come in 2026.

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,680
 And it's a word for us as a community together

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,000
 because if this is your home church,

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,960
 you're not here just as yourself.

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,920
 You're here a part of a community.

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,200
 But it is also, as I said last week,

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,920
 a word for you individually, for you personally

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,040
 in what is happening in your life.

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,120
 And it is this word that we're in uncharted territory,

32
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,040
 that the Lord is wanting to move us into uncharted waters.

33
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,540
 And I shared a picture last week

34
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,660
 that I had a few months ago

35
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,760
 about us as a church community like this,

36
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,920
 one of those early pioneer ships

37
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,600
 where they would be in safe harbor,

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,540
 but then they would set out from safe harbor

39
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,480
 out into the ocean,

40
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,400
 and they would literally be sailing out

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,440
 to where there was no maps.

42
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,400
 And they had this early kind of unreasonable hope

43
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,520
 that they believed that if they just sailed

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,520
 beyond what they had currently mapped out,

45
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,800
 that there might be lands beyond what they could realize

46
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,240
 or what they thought.

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,800
 And this idea of the uncharted is exactly that,

48
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,640
 that there is no map,

49
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,360
 there's no ability for us to know what's ahead

50
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,880
 because we've never been there before.

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,000
 And the great encouragement

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,120
 that the Holy Spirit is saying to us as the Bind Church is,

53
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,600
 I desire to take you to a place corporately

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,640
 and individually where you've never been before,

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,580
 where you've never experienced me like that before,

56
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,880
 where you've never seen my kingdom and my spirit at work

57
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,360
 like it's going to work ever before.

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,040
 And therefore, there is no strategy,

59
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,600
 there's no current resource,

60
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,040
 there are no current gifts

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,840
 that are gonna be appropriate for what is to come,

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,880
 but this is a completely different time, different season.

63
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,040
 And what God is saying is,

64
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,120
 are we ready to prepare ourselves

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,120
 for what that is that is to come?

66
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,320
 And it's interesting

67
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,000
 'cause he's pulling us out of our comfort zones.

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,080
 He's put us in a place where we're going to be

69
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,120
 not with the things that normally would tether us

70
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
 and give us stability,

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,900
 we're gonna be a little bit out of what's comfortable for us.

72
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,500
 But I want you to know that the greatest moments

73
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,880
 of growth in your life will always occur with Christ Jesus

74
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,960
 when you're out of your comfort zone,

75
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,240
 where you're in a place

76
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,500
 where you're gonna have to rely on him.

77
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,760
 Last week, I shared a few things

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,620
 that I felt would shape this season.

79
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,600
 It's gonna be a season of discovery and adventure

80
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,820
 focused on the unknown but anticipated.

81
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,360
 This is really important, the unknown but anticipated.

82
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,320
 It's unknown because this is an uncharted season.

83
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,120
 So by its very definition, we don't know what's ahead.

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,200
 But because it's unknown

85
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,160
 it doesn't mean that our posture at this time

86
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,400
 as a community should be passive.

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,320
 It doesn't mean that, okay,

88
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,560
 we don't know what God's gonna do.

89
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,120
 So we're just gonna sit back and kind of just wait for it.

90
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,760
 In the picture I had last week of that sailing ship

91
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,640
 that's heading out into the unknown,

92
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,400
 the captain's there at the bow at the front,

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,180
 leaning forward with his telescope,

94
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,640
 looking for what's to come,

95
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,000
 the intentionality within his spirit

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,940
 to look forward with hope for what is to come.

97
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,800
 So it's unknown, but we need to have a posture of heart,

98
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,600
 of focus within us, of anticipation for what's about to come.

99
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,000
 Does that make sense?

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,560
 The second thing we shared is that

101
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,160
 it's going to be a season of wholehearted reliance

102
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,520
 and trust in Jesus above everything else.

103
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,200
 Because we don't currently have the map

104
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,840
 and the strategy to hold us where God's taking us.

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,800
 And we shared last week that it is this purging season.

106
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,520
 That perhaps as a church community

107
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,000
 and perhaps as you as an individual,

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,160
 there have been some things

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,640
 that you've gotten comfortable with to rely on

110
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,600
 that you've been trusting and putting your hope

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,400
 and your faith and your reliance on that are not Jesus.

112
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,240
 One of the primary reasons why God brings his church

113
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,140
 into a season of the uncharted is to shake off

114
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,120
 some of the things that we've begun to rely on

115
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,240
 that are not him.

116
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,360
 And so as we go through this year,

117
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,440
 we're gonna be challenging ourselves, challenging you.

118
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
 Have we gone over reliant on something?

119
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,240
 Are we trusting in our own strength?

120
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
 Are we trusting in the things

121
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
 that we've trusted in the past?

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And maybe they were great for us in the past,

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,120
 but these are not the things

124
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,320
 that we should be trusting on now.

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,160
 No, this is a season where Jesus gets the wholehearted

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,920
 reliance and trust in our lives.

127
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,760
 The third thing we shared is that it's going to be a season

128
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,000
 where God's people, and this is really important,

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,200
 a season of intentional readiness

130
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,600
 where God's people rely and prepare,

131
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,040
 not with a plan of action, but a purpose of their hearts.

132
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,600
 In other words, because this is uncharted,

133
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
 we don't have the map or the strategy

134
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,400
 that will help us to plan the action steps we need to take

135
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,320
 in order to benefit from the season.

136
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,080
 No, instead, it's not about an action plan,

137
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,120
 it's about the posture of my heart.

138
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,600
 It's about what's going on inside of me.

139
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,120
 It's about the values that I hold to,

140
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,560
 because when God acts, I want to be one who responds.

141
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,480
 And so you need to understand that in a season of uncharted,

142
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,920
 the spotlight that the Holy Spirit is shining

143
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,280
 is on our character over our competencies.

144
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,360
 I'm gonna say that again.

145
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,480
 It's shining on our character over our competencies.

146
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,000
 Not that we can't have gifts,

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,360
 not that we can't be good at things,

148
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,760
 not that God hasn't blessed us

149
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,720
 with things that we're good at, of course,

150
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,080
 but in this season, the focus becomes more the character

151
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,000
 than the competencies, 'cause here's the thing,

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,360
 we don't know what competencies

153
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,600
 we're gonna need for the future.

154
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,080
 It's uncharted, no one's ever been there before.

155
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,360
 We've not been there before, we've not experienced it.

156
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,760
 We don't know what strategies or ministries

157
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
 or responses we're going to need when God acts,

158
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,960
 so it's not about trying to come up with the competencies

159
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
 that are gonna hold us when God moves,

160
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,600
 it's about the character we need today

161
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,560
 so that when God does move,

162
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,080
 when the treasure is discovered in the field,

163
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,440
 when we see that pearl of great price,

164
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,400
 we give everything, we're ready to give it all,

165
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,840
 we're ready to respond straight away.

166
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,920
 It's a little bit like the people

167
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,960
 that work in the fire service,

168
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,760
 who are trained to respond without fear immediately

169
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,520
 when the fire takes place.

170
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,680
 Could you imagine a church that was trained

171
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,560
 to respond without fear when the kingdom of God is at work?

172
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,800
 When God begins to do something in our workplace

173
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,200
 and we don't have the fear of going,

174
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,880
 oh my gosh, I'm not gonna pray for this person

175
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,720
 in front of everybody,

176
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,440
 'cause if I did that, I'm gonna be judged,

177
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,320
 but instead we're over our fear

178
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,280
 and we've got the character that says

179
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,720
 that when God's presence is here, I will respond

180
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,640
 and here's somebody who desperately needs prayer,

181
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,400
 I'm gonna ask him if I can pray for them.

182
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,840
 Or perhaps we're at that family dinner

183
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,400
 and we're sitting next to the uncle or the aunt

184
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,080
 that's twice removed, who we know is really abrasive

185
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
 against the Christian faith,

186
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,640
 and they're beginning to ask us

187
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,000
 how things are going in our lives

188
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,200
 and what's happening in their lives,

189
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,920
 and we're thinking, well, I better not share anything

190
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,640
 about church 'cause it's gonna upset them,

191
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,120
 and we sense that the Holy Spirit is saying

192
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,480
 this might be a moment where you can begin to testify

193
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,800
 about what God's doing in your life

194
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,520
 and you've been trained and equipped

195
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,880
 to respond to the kingdom without fear.

196
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,640
 Can you imagine a church like that?

197
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,800
 This is not the first time in history

198
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,920
 that God has called his church

199
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,480
 to focus on their character over their competencies

200
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,320
 'cause he's moving them into the uncharted.

201
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,960
 In fact, perhaps the most important moment

202
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,120
 that this has happened in church history

203
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,760
 is the early church in the first century,

204
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,560
 those first disciples as they're wrestling

205
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,160
 with the profundity that Jesus has risen from the dead.

206
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,200
 I mean, imagine the experience they went through

207
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,600
 believing that Jesus was the Messiah

208
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,200
 and then seeing him killed on a cross

209
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,000
 and then walking away from that going like,

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,120
 well, maybe we got that wrong, I guess he was just a prophet

211
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,800
 but then Jesus raised from the dead,

212
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,040
 shows himself to them, and suddenly they realize

213
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,840
 he is the Messiah, he is the one

214
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,200
 that we've been longing for, he has come,

215
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,480
 and then Jesus says to them,

216
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,040
 hey, here's the great commission,

217
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,760
 go into the Greco-Roman Empire,

218
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,440
 sharing the faith of the gospel,

219
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,000
 teaching people to obey my commands

220
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,720
 and I'll be with you forever,

221
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,400
 and then stay here in Jerusalem

222
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,800
 and I'm gonna send the Holy Spirit to empower you to go.

223
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,120
 And then suddenly the disciples are thrust

224
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,920
 into uncharted territory, uncharted waters.

225
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,920
 They had no idea that Jesus was gonna expect them to do

226
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,680
 what he expects them to do.

227
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,680
 And he doesn't give them a roadmap or a strategy or a plan,

228
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,360
 he sends them out in the power of the Holy Spirit

229
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,520
 to experience the kingdom, to find the treasure,

230
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,920
 to see the pearls.

231
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,240
 The beautiful thing about the gospel of Acts

232
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,720
 is that it's this wonderful idea of what happens

233
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,040
 when God shows up when you're least expecting it.

234
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
 Throughout the whole book, you have these moments

235
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,760
 where the writer, Luke, is writing these things

236
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,920
 and he uses this Greek word for suddenly.

237
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,240
 He uses it a lot because he's trying to express

238
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,960
 the suddenness of God's kingdom.

239
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,680
 He's like, suddenly the person is there

240
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,280
 and the disciples try to pray for him.

241
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,160
 Suddenly the chains break off

242
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,560
 and they're free from prison.

243
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,920
 Suddenly this happens, suddenly that happens.

244
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,080
 And it's amazing because you see time and time again,

245
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,120
 the disciples just going about their normal average day,

246
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,040
 not expecting anything, and suddenly

247
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,360
 the kingdom of God appears.

248
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,520
 And here's the question, will the disciples respond

249
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,160
 when they see a suddenly of God?

250
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,120
 And one of the things that you almost see all the time

251
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,120
 in the book of Acts is that when there's a suddenly of God,

252
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,520
 there's an immediate response from the church.

253
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,520
 There's an immediate respond in faith

254
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,800
 to what the kingdom and what the spirit

255
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,920
 is doing in that moment.

256
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,400
 And this teaches us something so important

257
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,920
 about uncharted seasons.

258
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,760
 Look, we cannot predict the suddenlies,

259
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,960
 but we can prepare for the immediatelys.

260
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,440
 Come on, church.

261
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,200
 We can't predict the suddenlies.

262
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,320
 This is uncharted season.

263
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,880
 So by its very definition, we can't predict

264
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,600
 when or how or what God is gonna do.

265
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,160
 God's not asking you to predict the suddenlies.

266
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,440
 That's his domain, not yours.

267
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
 You can't do that.

268
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,040
 What you can do though is prepare yourself

269
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,000
 for the immediatelys, that when God does show up,

270
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,480
 when you discover the treasure, when you see the pearl,

271
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,440
 you respond because you put character over competency.

272
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,080
 You put your values over anything else.

273
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,360
 And your value is to say, God, when you act,

274
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,640
 I wanna be one of the workers in the work field.

275
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,640
 I wanna be one of the ones that's reaching out

276
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,920
 with the gospel of hope.

277
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,600
 Lord, would you choose me?

278
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,760
 If you act, I'm gonna respond.

279
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,600
 Are you with me?

280
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,840
 So what we're gonna do with you over the next six weeks,

281
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,800
 we're actually gonna walk through the story of Acts.

282
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,080
 We're not gonna look at it as like a book study.

283
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,920
 We're gonna pull out actually a study

284
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,400
 on the character of the disciples, the early church.

285
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,040
 And we're gonna look at what are some of the key values

286
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,080
 that they hold in them that enables them

287
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,520
 to be positioned for the immediatelys

288
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,480
 when God does it suddenly.

289
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,240
 And we're gonna teach you six of these things.

290
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,720
 And the reason why we're focusing on this

291
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,680
 is 'cause these are the things that we feel

292
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,040
 like the Holy Spirit is wanting to teach in us.

293
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,640
 Let me show you what the six values are gonna be.

294
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,080
 Stepping out, the obedience to respond

295
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,200
 to the way that the Holy Spirit is,

296
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,360
 even when it's uncomfortable to do so.

297
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,280
 The openness to changing our thinking and our traditions

298
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,560
 when God challenges them.

299
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,440
 (audience laughing)

300
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,880
 The willingness to be persecuted for our faith.

301
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,360
 Come on, church.

302
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,680
 Yeah, this is gonna be a great series.

303
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,080
 Do come back next week, by the way.

304
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,120
 It's gonna be.

305
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,200
 The sacrifice of trusting in Jesus

306
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,520
 even when it might cost us dearly.

307
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,600
 The ability to commit to hardship

308
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,280
 when we know it has redemptive purpose.

309
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,400
 The call to sharing our faith radically,

310
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,520
 honestly, and hopefully.

311
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,040
 My friends, these are the core character values

312
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,080
 that the early church held inside of them,

313
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,560
 which enabled them to do the things

314
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
 that God wanted to do through them.

315
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,400
 Not that they had a monopoly on what God was going to do,

316
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,360
 but when God acted, these things enabled them

317
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,240
 out of obedience, out of trust,

318
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,840
 out of the willingness to be persecuted,

319
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,680
 out of the openness to walking through hard times

320
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,360
 and hardships, they positioned themselves

321
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,520
 time and time again for the glory of God

322
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,840
 in the place that he had placed them.

323
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,080
 Could you imagine a church in Hong Kong

324
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,800
 that was willing to be persecuted for its faith?

325
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,560
 Could you imagine a church that's willing

326
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,640
 to go through hardship knowing it has redemptive purpose?

327
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,480
 Could you imagine a church full of courageous

328
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,040
 and bold people sharing their faith

329
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,000
 'cause they've been liberated from the fear of man?

330
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,400
 And I think this is not just something

331
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,000
 that God wants the Hong Kong church to hold.

332
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I think it's something the global church needs at this time.

333
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,720
 And so we're gonna go through this series together

334
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,800
 step by step and we're gonna bring

335
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,240
 some pretty challenging messages to you

336
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,720
 over the next six weeks and my prayer

337
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,680
 is that God would do something within us,

338
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,440
 preparing us for the immediately of his suddenness.

339
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,120
 We're gonna start today by just looking

340
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,160
 at the first of these and it's really

341
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,800
 just the first few verses of the book of Acts itself

342
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,560
 'cause in these verses you see Jesus do something.

343
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,360
 Before any of the suddenness occur,

344
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,680
 Jesus prepares his disciples for their next step,

345
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,240
 for the way in which he can liberate them,

346
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,200
 release some things from them

347
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,840
 so that they could be best prepared

348
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,120
 for the suddenness to come.

349
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,600
 Let me read this to you from Acts chapter one

350
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,200
 starting in verse one.

351
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,160
 In my former book, Theophilus,

352
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,960
 I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and teach

353
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,080
 until the day that he was taken up to heaven.

354
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,160
 After giving instructions through the Holy Spirit

355
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,120
 to the apostles that he had chosen.

356
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,760
 After his suffering, he showed himself

357
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,760
 to these men and women and gave many convincing proofs

358
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,880
 that he was alive.

359
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,040
 He appeared to them over a period of 40 days

360
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,440
 and spoke about the kingdom of God.

361
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,320
 On one occasion while he was eating with them,

362
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,520
 he gave them this command,

363
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,200
 "Do not leave Jerusalem,

364
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,840
 "but wait for the gift my father promised,

365
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,480
 "which you have heard me speak about.

366
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
 "For John baptized with water,

367
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,520
 "but in a few days time you will be baptized

368
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,840
 "with the Holy Spirit."

369
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,880
 I love what Luke's doing here.

370
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,600
 He's writing this book to his Gentile benefactor,

371
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,080
 probably a wealthy Gentile called Theophilus

372
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,120
 who was interested in the Christian faith.

373
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,760
 He's writing a story about what happens

374
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
 in the early church to this person.

375
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,840
 He starts by capturing this moment

376
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,720
 where Jesus is in his resurrection

377
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,360
 and he's beginning to shape and mold the disciples

378
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,640
 for all that's next.

379
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,320
 I wonder if you've ever put yourself

380
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,960
 in the shoes of the disciples at the start of the book of Acts

381
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,880
 'cause here's these disciples

382
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,960
 and they've just encountered Jesus' death and resurrection.

383
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,360
 They've had to wrestle deeply with the reality of that,

384
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,800
 but now he's risen, they've seen him,

385
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,360
 he's appeared to them over 600 times, over a lot of times,

386
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,880
 and he's beginning to teach them about the new things.

387
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,400
 So there's the great commission

388
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,360
 and then he says, "Stay in Jerusalem

389
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,240
 "'cause I'm gonna send you the Spirit

390
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,480
 "which is gonna be the thing that will power you

391
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,400
 "for what's ahead."

392
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,680
 So he's speaking about this,

393
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,200
 but the disciples are now wrestling with the reality

394
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,080
 that Jesus actually is the Messiah.

395
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,120
 And I want you to follow this

396
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,400
 'cause this is really important for the beginning of Acts.

397
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,080
 The disciples know that now Jesus is absolutely the Messiah.

398
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,120
 So in their mind, they're thinking that Jesus

399
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,360
 is gonna do some very specific things next

400
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,120
 because they're thinking that they're in a situation

401
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,880
 where Jesus is now gonna act

402
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,960
 how they had always anticipated he was going to act.

403
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,240
 And so they're posturing themselves for that,

404
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,800
 but then Jesus says, "Hey, I'm leaving."

405
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,080
 And you can imagine the disciples going,

406
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,360
 "But you've only just come back.

407
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,680
 "You've only just returned.

408
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,280
 "What do you mean you're gonna leave again?"

409
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,440
 And they're kind of thinking, "No, no, no, that can't work.

410
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,480
 "That can't be."

411
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,400
 It's funny, right?

412
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,560
 The disciples have always struggled with the reality

413
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,880
 of trying to tell Jesus what to do.

414
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,280
 Have you noticed that?

415
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,040
 It's almost like the disciples look at Jesus and go,

416
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,120
 "God loves you, but we have a plan for you."

417
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,040
 Because remember right back before

418
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,480
 when Jesus was saying, "I'm gonna have to die on the cross,"

419
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
 there's Peter going, "No, no, no, no, no, no.

420
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
 "That's not part of our plan.

421
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,520
 "No, no, you don't need to die.

422
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,440
 "It's cool, dude.

423
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,760
 "You'll be fine."

424
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,200
 And he's like, "Get behind me, Satan."

425
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,440
 Remember that moment.

426
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,920
 Well, here's another moment like that

427
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,360
 'cause Jesus is saying, "Hey, I'm gonna go,

428
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,280
 "but I need to go 'cause I'm gonna send

429
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,120
 "the Holy Spirit to you."

430
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,600
 And they're saying, "We don't wanna downgrade Jesus.

431
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,080
 "We want you here.

432
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,280
 "You've resurrected.

433
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,320
 "You're the Messiah.

434
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
 "We want you here.

435
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,680
 "And not only do we want you here,

436
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,680
 "but there's still work for you to do, Jesus.

437
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,840
 "We've still got some ideas for the things

438
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,040
 "that you should be doing in your resurrection."

439
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
 In fact, it actually says here, notice this,

440
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,680
 follow on in verse six.

441
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,000
 It says, "So when they met together,

442
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
 "they actually asked him this,

443
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,760
 "Lord, are you at this time going to restore

444
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,960
 "the kingdom of Israel?"

445
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,280
 In other words, the disciples are like,

446
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,680
 "We have an idea, Lord,

447
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,800
 "of what you're supposed to now be doing.

448
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,440
 "And we know this because our rabbis

449
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,880
 "have been teaching this in the synagogue

450
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,120
 "and our prophets of old, prophets like Jeremiah

451
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,600
 "and Isaiah and Amos and Daniel,

452
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,520
 "they've been saying that a day will come

453
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,480
 "when the Messiah will be here

454
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,760
 "and it will be like a day of Yahweh.

455
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,360
 "The Son of Man will come down and be with us

456
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,240
 "and sin will be eradicated

457
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,160
 "and Israel will be restored."

458
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,520
 That's the word they use here.

459
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,960
 Are you gonna restore?

460
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,600
 Are you gonna bring everything back

461
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,240
 into the hands of Israel?

462
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,240
 They're expecting Jesus now to do that.

463
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,480
 And this is their idea of what they want Jesus.

464
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,680
 This is like, they're like literally coming up to Jesus

465
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,400
 and going, "Yeah, that's nice about the Spirit,

466
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,760
 "but Jesus, you're forgetting something.

467
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,560
 "We've got a plan here.

468
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,040
 "And we've been talking about this plan for a long time.

469
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,520
 "And this plan, I just want you to show,

470
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,400
 "we've actually done a really nice cute map

471
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,320
 "of this plan, Jesus.

472
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,360
 "Let me just show you this."

473
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,120
 Right, the very first thing you're now gonna do

474
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,360
 is get rid of the Romans.

475
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
 Yeah, you know, the nasty Romans,

476
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,760
 you're gonna get rid of them.

477
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,320
 After that, you're then supposed to get rid of sin.

478
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,480
 If you wanna get rid of sin first before the Romans,

479
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,760
 that's fine, but we'd rather you punish the Romans first.

480
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,080
 So that's why the Romans are there first.

481
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,920
 Do you see this, Jesus?

482
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,200
 Don't worry, we've summarized it all

483
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,600
 in a bullet point form here, easy for you to follow.

484
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,040
 Here it is, Jesus.

485
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,840
 Now we laugh, but here's what I wanna say to us.

486
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,720
 I think this is the first thing

487
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,400
 that Jesus wants to release from us as his church.

488
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,920
 I think so many of us, myself included,

489
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,320
 that's really how I am in relationship with Jesus in prayer.

490
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,880
 Come on, church.

491
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,760
 Like, Jesus, I love you, but I have a plan for you.

492
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
 And my plan for you is this,

493
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,000
 because I have some important things

494
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 that I'm trying to do in life,

495
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,840
 and I'm trying to achieve some things,

496
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,440
 and I've got some ideas, Lord.

497
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,760
 And in fact, if you have a moment, Jesus,

498
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,240
 I'd like to just take you into my map

499
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,480
 and just show you a little bit of what I had in plan.

500
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,760
 Right here is when you're supposed to give me my spouse.

501
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,360
 Okay, you haven't done that one yet,

502
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,080
 but I'm just highlighting it for you in case you forgot.

503
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,920
 But that's cool.

504
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,960
 After that, you can see that promotion I've been praying for.

505
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,400
 I know that's coming, right?

506
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,960
 And I know you wanna do that, and are you with me?

507
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,600
 Like, isn't it interesting that we as Christians,

508
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,160
 we have this plan, we have this idea,

509
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,440
 we have a map for what we want Jesus to do,

510
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,080
 and it's like we're in this moment

511
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,200
 where we want him in our prayer lives

512
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,840
 to basically enact what we're doing.

513
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,040
 Let me just say, not the whole of your plan

514
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,880
 that you have is bad, but it's your plan.

515
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,360
 It's not his.

516
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,160
 And maybe elements of it he will do,

517
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,560
 and elements of it are great,

518
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,800
 and elements of it he might wanna respond to,

519
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,400
 but it's not about you having a plan

520
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,120
 of what Jesus is gonna do in your life.

521
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,480
 It's about recognizing you're in an uncharted season,

522
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,080
 which means the plan has been stripped from you,

523
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,720
 which means he's placing you specifically in a moment

524
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,280
 where all the things that are on the list

525
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,960
 that you're constantly asking him to respond to,

526
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,480
 again, are not necessarily bad things,

527
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,080
 but he's wanting to shift your thinking

528
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,960
 and shift your spiritual life away from Jesus.

529
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,600
 Here's the things I need you now to do for me,

530
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,040
 to Jesus, what is it that you desire to do?

531
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,320
 What is on your heart, not just for me,

532
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,120
 but for the vine and for Hong Kong and for the city?

533
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,360
 Like, we're in times where I don't know what's next,

534
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,000
 so Lord, I'm relying and I'm trusting on you,

535
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,280
 I'm letting go of what I would like,

536
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,640
 and I'm putting myself in an uncomfortable position

537
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,120
 to ask what you would like.

538
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,840
 And I'm willing to release anything from me

539
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,600
 that you do not like,

540
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,360
 even the plans that I have to prosper you, Jesus.

541
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,560
 That scripture, by the way, is,

542
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,440
 I have plans to prosper you, says the Lord.

543
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,680
 But we Christians so often live in our prayer lives

544
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,320
 as we've got plans to prosper you, Jesus.

545
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,800
 Are you with me?

546
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,680
 And so we need to purge ourselves from that.

547
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,320
 Notice how Jesus responds, I think this is so beautiful.

548
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,920
 He says in verse seven, he said to them,

549
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,720
 "It is not for you to know the times or dates

550
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,320
 "the Father has set by his own authority."

551
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,560
 He doesn't say it's not gonna happen,

552
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,800
 he just wants to shift them away from something

553
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,880
 that is so critical here.

554
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,360
 He's saying, "It is not for you in a season of uncharted

555
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,320
 "to have the answers to the timing of everything."

556
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,520
 It's not for you to know the when of God, he's saying.

557
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,200
 In fact, he's basically saying to the disciples,

558
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,920
 I wanna liberate you, I wanna free you,

559
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,520
 I wanna release you from the prison

560
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,880
 that is created by your desire

561
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,800
 to know when I'm going to do everything.

562
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,160
 It is not for you to have the understanding of the when.

563
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,560
 The when of God is such a thing that we as Christians,

564
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,400
 I think, so hold onto.

565
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,720
 I know that so much in our prayer life,

566
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,200
 in our pastoral work, it's like,

567
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,560
 when is God gonna come through?

568
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,200
 And here's the thing, when Christians have an idea

569
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,880
 of what they think the timeframe should be for God

570
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,360
 and God doesn't act in their timeframe,

571
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,720
 they get angry at God.

572
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,280
 I know I've done this many times in my own life.

573
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,640
 You've heard me tell many stories over the years of time.

574
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,040
 So I've put God in a time box

575
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
 and God doesn't do it in that time box

576
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,440
 and I get frustrated and angry at God

577
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,240
 because he hasn't done what I've wanted him to do

578
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,600
 when I was hoping he could do it.

579
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,120
 The disciples come to him and go, is now the time?

580
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,280
 And Jesus goes, the first thing I need to do

581
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,080
 as you move into uncharted territory

582
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,840
 is to release you from the worry of time.

583
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,320
 Some of you in this room,

584
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,240
 you are so tied up in the frustration

585
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,400
 of the perceived delay in the delivery

586
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,240
 of God's activity in your life

587
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,880
 or the obsession you have for the need

588
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,600
 of the foreknowledge of it

589
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,400
 that you are totally unprepared to react and respond to it

590
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
 when it actually arrives.

591
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
 Oh, church, man, I need you to read that

592
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,560
 and pause on that for a second.

593
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:20,520
 Some of us are so wound up by knowing the when,

594
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,800
 by holding on to the timeframe that we have

595
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,440
 and the first thing God wants to do is liberate you

596
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,200
 from the desire that you have to know it all.

597
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,960
 This was the desire that Adam and Eve had

598
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,360
 when they took the fruit in Genesis 3.

599
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,040
 What Satan said to them through the form of the snake was,

600
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,200
 if you take this, you will be like God.

601
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,120
 You will know it all.

602
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,400
 It's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

603
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,240
 And here's the disciples again saying,

604
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,520
 we need to know what it is you're going to do.

605
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,240
 And Jesus says, it's not for you to know the time.

606
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,600
 I wanna liberate you from the concerns

607
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,800
 that you have for time.

608
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,640
 'Cause here's the thing,

609
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
 the reason why we are so concerned with time

610
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,320
 is 'cause we want to control.

611
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,360
 We wanna find some stability,

612
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,160
 particularly when we're out of our comfort zones.

613
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,480
 We wanna find something that we can ridge ourselves into.

614
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,960
 And if we could just know the timing that God has

615
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,240
 for certain things that can happen in our lives,

616
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,240
 that would, we think, free us to relax.

617
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,080
 And what God is saying is that your obsession with time,

618
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,560
 when that is not in your hands

619
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,000
 and not something you can control,

620
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,840
 that's you trying to be God.

621
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,600
 You're not God, you're human.

622
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
 I'm gonna release your desire

623
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,160
 for the knowledge of the time of everything,

624
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,680
 and you will find yourself at greater peace.

625
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,320
 See, the path for peace in times that are uncharted

626
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,280
 is not the knowledge of the timing of everything,

627
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,280
 but the release of the need for control and certainty

628
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,200
 in all that's going to happen.

629
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,040
 And we cannot start this time,

630
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,640
 we cannot start as a church in this season of uncharted

631
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,600
 until we've recognized that we need to release control,

632
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,560
 release the control and the certainty

633
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
 that God is going to act and respond,

634
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,040
 and instead, posture our hearts

635
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,880
 in the place of character and values

636
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,480
 to be able to respond when he acts.

637
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,800
 Are you with me?

638
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,040
 Some of you here, this is a really,

639
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,160
 I just wanna, I'm gonna pause on this one more time.

640
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,040
 Some of you here, this is a really significantly

641
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,960
 fundamental thing that you need to release today.

642
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,720
 And it's scary.

643
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,080
 It'll put you in your, out of your comfort zone.

644
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,480
 It will put you in a place where you'll feel

645
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,160
 like you're losing control,

646
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,080
 but sometimes the need for us to feel

647
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,560
 like we're losing control or that we're out

648
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,840
 of that place of comfort is the starting point

649
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,480
 of everything that Jesus now wants to do in us.

650
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,600
 Notice how this is actually here in the scripture.

651
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,000
 Is this helping some people?

652
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,040
 Okay.

653
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,640
 It says here in verse seven,

654
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,840
 "It is not for you to know the times

655
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,640
 "and the dates that the Father has set," verse eight,

656
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,560
 "but you will receive power

657
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,280
 "when the Holy Spirit comes on you,

658
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,400
 "and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem

659
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,840
 "and Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth."

660
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,160
 I love this, he doesn't say,

661
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,840
 "Hey, I'm going to give you the answers."

662
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,960
 He doesn't say, "I'm gonna sort out all your problems."

663
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,240
 He doesn't say, "I'm gonna like answer your timeframe,

664
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,080
 "how you have it."

665
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,760
 We've come to him with our maps.

666
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,000
 He's gently rolled them back up again.

667
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,960
 But here's what he's saying.

668
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,520
 I'm not leaving you alone.

669
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,360
 He said, "You're gonna receive power

670
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,360
 "when my Holy Spirit comes upon you."

671
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,360
 So I'm not leaving you to just be here on your own.

672
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,600
 Equally, I'm not giving you a detailed map

673
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,360
 that's gonna give you all the answers straight away.

674
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,240
 What I will do though is put my power inside of you.

675
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,600
 I will pour out my Holy Spirit on you,

676
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,440
 and that power will be what will mark you,

677
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,880
 will be what defines you.

678
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,600
 You're not getting answers, you're gonna get my power.

679
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,840
 You're not gonna get the timing of everything,

680
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,360
 you're gonna get my Spirit in your life.

681
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,160
 And when you have my power, then you can become.

682
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,920
 This is so important.

683
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,320
 So often, I think as a church,

684
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,840
 when we think about the power of the Holy Spirit,

685
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,120
 we think it's for us.

686
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,480
 We think it's for what happens here on a Sunday.

687
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,640
 We come in here longing for the worship

688
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,040
 and longing for the movement of the Holy Spirit amongst us,

689
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,600
 and we love that, and of course we should.

690
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,080
 It's something to be celebrated.

691
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,240
 It is something to be expected and looked for.

692
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,680
 But the power that Jesus is talking here about

693
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,840
 is not a feeling in a worship service.

694
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,640
 What he's talking about here to the disciples

695
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,360
 is you're gonna receive power,

696
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,680
 and then notice what he says.

697
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,760
 He specifically says, "And then you will become."

698
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,000
 In the Greek, it says, "You will become."

699
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,840
 In our translation, it says, "You will be."

700
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,080
 It's future tense.

701
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,120
 What he's saying is, notice the journey,

702
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,960
 what Jesus is doing.

703
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,600
 He's saying, "Your plan, not gonna work.

704
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,200
 "Your obsession with timing is only gonna cause you stress.

705
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,920
 "I need you to release all of that

706
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,200
 "so that you're a vessel ready to receive

707
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,880
 "the power of my Spirit."

708
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,960
 But that power of the Spirit is not just there

709
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,040
 to make you feel good or to give you some gifts

710
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,160
 or to give you some fruit, as much as that is good.

711
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,240
 Here's what the power of that Spirit will do.

712
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,280
 It will make you to become.

713
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,160
 It will transform you.

714
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,440
 It will form you, shape you into the person

715
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,240
 that I need you to be in the time of Uncharted.

716
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,920
 The reason why the Holy Spirit is poured out

717
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,800
 in seasons of Uncharted is because the Spirit

718
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,480
 longs to change us, longs to transform us and renew us.

719
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,640
 The focus is on character over competency.

720
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,160
 So the Spirit comes to reform and to change.

721
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,160
 And so a season of Uncharted is a spiritual formation season.

722
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,960
 By its very nature, times of Uncharted are Spirit-empowered.

723
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,800
 And because they're Spirit-empowered,

724
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,720
 they're designed to change something within us,

725
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,840
 to release sin from us, to strengthen us,

726
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,480
 to give us the character and the values that we will need

727
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,720
 so we can respond immediately to the suddenlies

728
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,560
 that are around us.

729
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,640
 And our vision here at the Vine is growing big people.

730
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,520
 It's a maturity vision.

731
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,680
 It's a spiritual formation vision.

732
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,720
 And this is why God's bringing us into the Uncharted.

733
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,840
 It's not to freak you out.

734
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,720
 It's not to make you feel uncomfortable.

735
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,680
 It's actually to change you.

736
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,840
 You gotta understand that the greatest times

737
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,360
 of spiritual growth and change will happen in your life

738
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,720
 when you have to rely 100% on Jesus and nothing else.

739
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,800
 The greatest times of spiritual growth and change

740
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,480
 in your life will happen when you let go

741
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,320
 of your need to know everything.

742
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,640
 The greatest spiritual change that will happen

743
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,720
 is when you actually say, "I am open

744
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,960
 "to whatever is your heart, your agenda,

745
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,560
 "your plans, your strategy,

746
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,040
 "whatever it is that you wanna do, I have no idea.

747
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,520
 "But whatever it is that you wanna do,

748
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,120
 "I want to receive it in the name of Jesus.

749
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,000
 "Make me into one."

750
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,080
 Oh, let me preach on this rule.

751
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,640
 This is not my note, so I need to preach on this rule.

752
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,080
 I'm gonna do this real quick, sorry.

753
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,400
 The prodigal son is one of my favorite stories,

754
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,160
 and it's because the prodigal son goes in this journey.

755
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,600
 At the start, he goes to his father,

756
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,680
 and he says, "Give me my inheritance."

757
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,120
 And then he goes, and he squanders it,

758
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,080
 and he's in a place of incredible uncomfort

759
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,520
 'cause of his sin and his brokenness.

760
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,480
 And he decides in that place that it's better

761
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,840
 to be a servant in his father's household

762
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,040
 than to be in the muck and the mire

763
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,000
 that he found himself in.

764
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,360
 And as he goes to his father, his father runs towards him,

765
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,280
 and the first words out of the mouth of the prodigal son

766
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,720
 is this, "Lord, make me.

767
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,880
 "Make me like one of your servants."

768
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,080
 There's something that happens in the life of the prodigal

769
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,800
 where he goes from God, "Give me," to God, "Make me."

770
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,720
 And that's the journey of the uncharted.

771
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,480
 That's the spiritual formation journey

772
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,000
 that we're in right now.

773
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,520
 And I wanna encourage you, challenge you

774
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,240
 to be open to whatever the Holy Spirit wants to do

775
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,200
 'cause there is a make me that I need,

776
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,900
 and I'm sure there is for you too.

777
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,200
 What is it that he is making us into?

778
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,480
 He then says this, "That you would become my witnesses

779
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,720
 "in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria

780
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,880
 "and to the ends of the earth."

781
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,200
 He says, "You will become my witnesses."

782
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,960
 Notice this, the word witness there in the Greek

783
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,960
 is the word martyris, which is where we get martyrdom from.

784
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,600
 It's the idea of living such a way that people can see.

785
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,960
 It was actually a legal term, and it was literally designed

786
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
 in the legal concepts of those days

787
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,240
 to be somebody can prove the verification of facts

788
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,920
 by how they've experienced and lived their lives.

789
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,920
 A witness is someone who demonstrates and declares

790
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,440
 what it is that has happened for them.

791
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,800
 So this emphasis of demonstrating and declaring,

792
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,880
 not just saying, but living.

793
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,840
 Remember a few weeks ago, we spoke about the idea

794
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,480
 of a new song that is on our mouths

795
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,600
 so that we can live it out so people can see it.

796
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,480
 That's a witness.

797
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,880
 So when Jesus says, "My spirit is gonna fall on you

798
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,960
 "and empower you to become a witness,"

799
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,320
 what he's saying is, "This is all about you

800
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,760
 "in public space.

801
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,360
 "This is all about me doing something in you

802
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,280
 "so that you would be something of me out there."

803
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,340
 He doesn't come to the church, to the disciples

804
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,840
 at the beginning of their formation of the church

805
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,960
 and say, "I'm gonna pour out my spirit of power upon you

806
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,080
 "so that you would be my privately blessed individuals."

807
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,240
 Come on, church.

808
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,480
 He doesn't say, "So that you will be my privately blessed

809
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,200
 "individuals and you'll have a great time

810
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,800
 "for 90 minutes on a Sunday, woo-hoo."

811
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,360
 He says, "No, I'm pouring out my spirit on you

812
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,340
 "because I'm moving you into uncharted seasons.

813
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,260
 "Take away your strategy, take away your obsession

814
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,460
 "about the timing of everything.

815
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,460
 "Receive my power because I wanna shape and form in you

816
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,920
 "something so much that you would then be

817
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,160
 "a public testimony, a public witness to my power,

818
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,080
 "my spirit, my life in the world."

819
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,760
 You're gonna be a witness, he says, in Jerusalem, Judea,

820
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,640
 Samaria, to the ends of the world.

821
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,680
 It's gonna be about what I do within you

822
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,100
 so that the church would be public,

823
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,540
 not private, huddled together as much as we love doing this,

824
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,880
 but we do this on behalf of everything

825
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,080
 that's gonna happen in your week ahead.

826
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,200
 This is uncharted, that we would be so filled

827
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,660
 with the spirit, that we're so changed within us

828
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,040
 that we become the living witnesses of God in the world.

829
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,120
 This is why the first value that Jesus is instilling

830
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,760
 into the disciples right at the start

831
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,600
 is this obedience to the work of the spirit,

832
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,480
 even if that means it's gonna be uncomfortable for you.

833
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,840
 Are you gonna be obedient to what the spirit is doing,

834
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,000
 even though that might put you

835
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,600
 in some challenging situations?

836
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,280
 Maybe that'll put you in a place where it's uncomfortable,

837
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,680
 but are you willing to live your life so much

838
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,800
 that you would become a witness of him,

839
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,840
 one who demonstrates and declares the glory of God

840
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,120
 in the world around him?

841
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,880
 And this, my friends, becomes all of the book of Acts

842
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,160
 from this point.

843
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,480
 This is why all of this is so important

844
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,040
 and why Jesus is teaching this right at the start

845
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,520
 into his church 'cause he's shaking off some of the dust

846
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,560
 that was gonna settle on them.

847
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,040
 He's preparing them for what's ahead.

848
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,840
 And in the future, in the weeks ahead,

849
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,440
 and we're gonna see this in the series a lot,

850
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,960
 his people become responders, witnesses to the power

851
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,000
 and the glory of God simply because they said

852
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,840
 they were open.

853
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,400
 In fact, let me show you one example of this very quickly

854
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,160
 here this morning as we draw to a close.

855
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,120
 I love this example.

856
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,200
 This is found in Acts chapter eight.

857
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,440
 Follow this.

858
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,640
 "Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip,"

859
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,040
 Philip, one of the disciples,

860
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,640
 "Go south to the road, the desert road,

861
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,960
 "that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.

862
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,480
 "So he started out," notice this.

863
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,600
 Philip had no idea what God was gonna do that day.

864
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,680
 He didn't go, "Okay, God, thank you for speaking to me

865
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,720
 "this morning in my quiet time.

866
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,680
 "I really appreciate that.

867
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,520
 "Great to have your voice in my life.

868
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,480
 "You want me to go down a road.

869
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,720
 "First of all, I need to know exactly

870
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,320
 "how to walk down that road.

871
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
 "It would be really good if you could tell me

872
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,760
 "what's ahead down that road.

873
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,360
 "I'd like to get prepared for all of that."

874
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,280
 This would be like God saying to me one morning,

875
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,000
 "Andrew, I want you to walk down one chai road.

876
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,440
 "I want you to walk from the Causeway Bay Inn

877
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,200
 "towards Central, and I just want you to walk."

878
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,440
 And me going, "I'm gonna walk."

879
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,720
 And you guys going, "What is Andrew doing?"

880
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,800
 Philip just has no idea.

881
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,400
 But notice, he's obedient to the Holy Spirit,

882
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,680
 even though it might be uncomfortable,

883
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,240
 even though he doesn't have all the answers,

884
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,320
 even though he doesn't know how things are gonna work out,

885
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,480
 but he's willing to go.

886
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,000
 Notice what happens next.

887
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,720
 So then he stepped out, and on his way,

888
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,600
 he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official

889
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,920
 in charge of all the treasury of Candace,

890
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,560
 queen of the Ethiopians.

891
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,120
 This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,

892
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,400
 and on his way home was sitting in his chariot

893
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,120
 reading the book of the Isaiah the prophet.

894
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,800
 The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot

895
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,440
 "and stay near it."

896
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,960
 Isn't this great?

897
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,840
 So here's Philip, no idea what's about to happen,

898
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,280
 no idea, but he's being faithful

899
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
 to what the Spirit's told him to do.

900
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,160
 He's walking randomly down this road,

901
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,240
 but in the side, the story is God is brewing up something

902
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,840
 that only God can brew up.

903
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,880
 And here's this Ethiopian eunuch,

904
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,720
 this man of standing in the upper Nile region of Africa,

905
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,800
 one that God has been working on his heart already,

906
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,360
 one who's actually gone to Jerusalem

907
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,640
 to learn what it might be to worship this Yahweh,

908
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,800
 to worship this God, and to wonder

909
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,440
 what the Messiah might be all about.

910
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,680
 So God's at work with the Ethiopian,

911
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,360
 and he's at work with Philip,

912
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,960
 who's willing to live in a certain way.

913
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,200
 And it's almost like God is bringing

914
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,160
 these two things together, and you can see God's excitement

915
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,800
 as they come closer and closer together.

916
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,960
 You following this?

917
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,320
 So here's Philip, now notice this.

918
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,000
 Then the Holy Spirit says, "Go and stand

919
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,360
 "alongside of that chariot."

920
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,880
 Now the chariot was walking at the time,

921
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,320
 so he's having to run alongside this chariot.

922
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,320
 I mean, he's looking like an idiot at this moment.

923
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,480
 But he's willing to be uncomfortable

924
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,960
 in obedience to the Holy Spirit.

925
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,800
 He's running alongside the chariot.

926
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,200
 He has no idea why he's running alongside the chariot.

927
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,800
 But as he's running alongside of it,

928
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,360
 he hears the person inside reading from the scroll,

929
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,880
 the book of Isaiah.

930
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,680
 Now here's the fascinating thing.

931
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,240
 At this point, notice what happens,

932
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,960
 because what we think is gonna happen doesn't.

933
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,720
 It says here, "Then Philip ran up to the chariot

934
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,800
 "and heard the man reading from Isaiah the prophet.

935
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,440
 "'Do you understand what you are reading?'

936
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,480
 "Philip asked.

937
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,360
 "'How can I?' he said.

938
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,120
 "'Unless someone explains it to me.'

939
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,120
 "So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him."

940
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,240
 I love this moment because the Holy Spirit had said,

941
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,840
 "Go down this road," he had gone.

942
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,800
 The Holy Spirit said, "Go alongside this chariot."

943
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,320
 He had gone alongside this chariot.

944
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,360
 Now the Holy Spirit said, "Talk to the guy."

945
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,600
 No, the Holy Spirit didn't say that.

946
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,960
 The Holy Spirit led him to the very place

947
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,520
 where then Philip, because he's got a character

948
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,520
 over competency, 'cause he knows he's uncharted waters,

949
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,880
 because the Holy Spirit has been forming and shaping him

950
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,440
 when he gets alongside the chariot,

951
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,240
 the Holy Spirit doesn't have to tell him

952
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,800
 to begin to witness to the gospel.

953
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,680
 No, he hears someone reading Isaiah,

954
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,760
 and his immediate response, the immediacy to God suddenly,

955
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,480
 is to say, "Do you understand what you're reading?

956
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,000
 "'Cause if not, I'd love to explain it to you."

957
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,480
 And the Ethiopian's like, "Dude, come on up, sit with me."

958
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,120
 And they sit together, and he shares the gospel with him.

959
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,080
 The Ethiopian believes the gospel,

960
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,280
 repents of his sin, gets baptized,

961
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,960
 and for all we know, he's the very first African convert

962
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,080
 to Christianity, and then he's gonna return back to Africa,

963
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,160
 and a whole continent gets evangelized

964
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,880
 because of this one moment,

965
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,320
 because Philip was obedient to the Spirit,

966
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,760
 was looking for the Spirit, walked with the Spirit,

967
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,040
 but then was willing to respond with an immediate lead

968
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
 to God suddenly.

969
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,280
 Are you with me?

970
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,760
 A whole nation comes to faith

971
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,040
 through somebody with that kind of faith.

972
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,800
 Let me close with a story.

973
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,480
 Last week, I shared the story about my mobile phone

974
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,120
 dying on me in the Camino,

975
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,440
 and I shared about how bad that was,

976
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,200
 but I actually only shared half the story with you.

977
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,800
 Let me now share the other half of the story as we close.

978
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,200
 My phone had completely died, broken, gone,

979
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,160
 and four days into it being busted,

980
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,640
 I was getting more and more frustrated.

981
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,720
 Frustrated I couldn't speak to my wife and daughter,

982
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,480
 frustrated I couldn't navigate well every day,

983
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,320
 frustrated I had to rely on everybody else,

984
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,120
 but my frustrations that day were even more

985
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,720
 because I'd realized the night before

986
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,480
 borrowing somebody else's mobile phone

987
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,160
 that the next mobile phone store

988
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,440
 was in a city seven days' walk away.

989
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,040
 And so I realized that not only am I facing

990
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,280
 these first four days, but I'm gonna have another seven days

991
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,360
 before I can actually get a phone up and running

992
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,480
 and be able to touch base

993
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,760
 with the people I needed to touch base with.

994
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,680
 So I was feeling this huge amount of frustration.

995
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,480
 I was walking, really angry at God.

996
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,000
 Anyone been angry at God here?

997
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,840
 Just your pastor, okay.

998
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,560
 So I'm walking, angry at God,

999
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,840
 and I'd just gone through a village.

1000
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,320
 I'd had a rest stop at this village.

1001
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,200
 I'd filled up my water and everything,

1002
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,040
 and I was good to go.

1003
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,520
 And so I came to this another village,

1004
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,960
 and I was expecting to walk through this village,

1005
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,720
 which happened a lot on the Camino,

1006
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,160
 'cause I'd just stopped, so I didn't need to stop.

1007
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,440
 So I was gonna walk through this village.

1008
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,840
 And as I'm walking through the village,

1009
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,560
 out of this cafe, this lady goes,

1010
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,600
 "Andrew, come and sit with me."

1011
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,920
 That's how her voice exactly sounded, by the way.

1012
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,720
 Just exactly like that.

1013
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,920
 Anyway, it was this lady, Jane,

1014
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,080
 that I'd met a couple of nights before.

1015
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,440
 Didn't know super well at that time.

1016
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,000
 I'd met her a couple of nights before.

1017
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,280
 But she wanted me to go sit with her.

1018
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,720
 The last thing I wanted to do was to stop and sit with her,

1019
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,400
 'cause I'd just stopped in the previous village.

1020
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,480
 And in the Camino, there's this unwritten code

1021
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,200
 that if you wave and smile and keep walking,

1022
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,520
 then that just means you wanna keep going.

1023
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,920
 And it's not seen as rude.

1024
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,200
 So I'm prepared to just wave at her.

1025
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,640
 And I feel like the Holy Spirit speaks to me.

1026
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
 And the Holy Spirit speaks really strongly,

1027
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,960
 and says, "You need to go sit with her."

1028
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,840
 And I'm like, "Okay."

1029
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,640
 (audience laughing)

1030
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,680
 So rather than walk on, I turn around,

1031
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,920
 and I sit down with Jane at this cafe.

1032
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,920
 And she asked me this question as soon as I sits down.

1033
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,760
 It's a really interesting question.

1034
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,160
 She said, "If you could change anything about the Camino,

1035
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,320
 "what would you change?"

1036
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,000
 And I said, "Well, right now, I would like to get in a bus,

1037
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,320
 "goes down seven days down the road on this bus,

1038
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,000
 "get to this place, and buy a mobile phone."

1039
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,720
 And I told her about my story about the mobile phone.

1040
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,640
 As I'm talking to her, she's listening to me very gently.

1041
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,000
 She gets her backpack out, and she opens up her backpack,

1042
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
 and she fishes inside the backpack,

1043
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,040
 and she pulls out a mobile phone.

1044
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,680
 And she says, she goes, "Andrew, a couple of months ago,

1045
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,960
 "when I was preparing for the Camino,

1046
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,520
 "I felt God tell me to bring a spare mobile phone with me."

1047
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,200
 And she said, "I pushed back on it

1048
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,740
 "because it's carrying extra weight in the bag,

1049
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,220
 "and you know that nobody wants to carry any extra weight,

1050
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,440
 "but I've been carrying this spare mobile phone

1051
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,660
 "for two weeks in the Camino for no reason

1052
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,520
 "why I was carrying it.

1053
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,880
 "Now you've just shared your story with me."

1054
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,480
 She goes, "I think God wants me to give you this phone."

1055
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,280
 And I said, "You are right.

1056
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,080
 "He does, don't you, too."

1057
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,760
 (audience applauding)

1058
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,800
 Faithful woman, faithful woman.

1059
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,920
 Thank you.

1060
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,920
 So as I'm taking this phone from her,

1061
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,280
 this other pilgrim walks in.

1062
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,120
 He's a German.

1063
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,040
 He's like, "Hallo."

1064
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,920
 I don't know how to do Germans.

1065
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,640
 I'm not gonna do German accent, but he says,

1066
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,960
 "Can I join you at your table?"

1067
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,800
 And we're like, "Yeah, sure."

1068
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,760
 He's a young German guy, and he comes and sits down,

1069
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,680
 and he's like, "What are you doing?"

1070
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,600
 You know, like he sees us handing phones back and forth.

1071
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,520
 It's the worst German accent ever.

1072
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,440
 But he sees us handing phones back and forth,

1073
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
 and I say, "Oh, well, you know."

1074
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
 And I share the story about everything that happened,

1075
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,120
 and his eyes lit up, and he goes, "Oh, back in Germany."

1076
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,600
 He's like, "Back in Germany, I work in a mobile phone store,

1077
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,560
 "and every day, all day long, I take people's old phones,

1078
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,600
 "and I get them up and working on a new phone.

1079
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,640
 "If you give me your phone,

1080
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,640
 "and if you take the SIM card out of your old phone,

1081
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,720
 "I will get your phone working in 15 minutes,

1082
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,640
 "and 15 minutes later, I suddenly have

1083
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,720
 "a brand spanking new mobile phone.

1084
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,000
 "Isn't that awesome?"

1085
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,920
 So here they are.

1086
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
 Let me show you a photo of them.

1087
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,920
 There they are.

1088
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,080
 (audience applauding)

1089
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,280
 Now, I will admit to you, I will admit to you

1090
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,600
 that Philip's story is way better than mine,

1091
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,200
 because Philip evangelized a whole nation,

1092
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,240
 and I just got a mobile phone.

1093
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,280
 But, but maybe it demonstrates that God works in this way,

1094
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,360
 in big and small ways, and that we never know

1095
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,800
 what it is that God is going to do,

1096
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,840
 but he is orchestrating it all,

1097
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,720
 and in times of unchartedness,

1098
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,360
 we can't predict the suddenlies,

1099
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,680
 but we can be prepared to react with the immediatelies.

1100
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,800
 And the way we do that is we have to let go

1101
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,960
 of those plans and strategies of what we want

1102
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,360
 or think Jesus should do for us.

1103
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,680
 We have to strip ourselves of the when of God,

1104
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,240
 and we have to place ourselves open

1105
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,320
 to receive the power of the Spirit

1106
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,640
 that changes us within us, and prepares us

1107
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,640
 that when the Holy Spirit says go, we go.

1108
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,720
 Let me pray for us.

1109
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,560
 Let's pray.

1110
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,960
 Father, I thank you for each person here in this room,

1111
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,320
 and I thank you for what it is that you're doing

1112
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,640
 in their hearts and in their lives,

1113
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,960
 and I thank you that you have moved them

1114
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,760
 into a season that is uncharted.

1115
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,040
 And Lord, we have no idea what it is

1116
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,320
 that you're about to do.

1117
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,120
 Philip on that day had no idea.

1118
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,840
 On that day, I had no idea I was gonna get a new phone.

1119
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,320
 And Lord, the people in this room have no idea

1120
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,960
 what tomorrow is going to hold in the adventure

1121
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,120
 and the excitement of an uncharted season.

1122
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,280
 But Lord, I wanna pray that we can prepare ourselves

1123
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,920
 for the immediate least, and I wanna pray

1124
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,560
 for each person here in this moment

1125
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,400
 that you would strip away, that you would release, Lord,

1126
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,080
 the things that we are relying on that are not of you.

1127
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,160
 Whether that's our own plans, whether that's our desire

1128
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,280
 for the timing and the when of God,

1129
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,320
 whether that's the frustrations because it feels

1130
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,120
 like you're not answering us on the ways

1131
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,680
 and the time where you thought.

1132
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,240
 Lord, I believe you wanna strip from people

1133
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,280
 in this room right now just an over-reliance

1134
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,240
 on the things that are only gonna create more frustration

1135
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,160
 in the season ahead, and instead, you wanna pour out

1136
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,880
 the power of your Holy Spirit.

1137
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,280
 So Lord, I wanna pray for each person here

1138
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,560
 as they release what it is that you're calling them

1139
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,640
 to release here this morning, that they would be filled

1140
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,680
 with the power of God, with the power of God

1141
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,480
 so that they could become your witnesses.

1142
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,320
 That they would become public manifestations

1143
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:07,640
 of the mercy and the grace and the love of Jesus.

1144
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,560
 That they would be like Philip, able to react and respond

1145
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,840
 as the Holy Spirit leads without fear.

1146
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,720
 So Lord, we come against fear.

1147
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,120
 We come against the things that hold us rooted

1148
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,080
 to the known.

1149
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,040
 We come against the things that would wanna root us

1150
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,600
 to where things are comfortable for us.

1151
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,560
 And Lord, we pray that you would fill us with such power

1152
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,040
 that we wouldn't just see the dramatic things

1153
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,200
 that we would see in these 90 minutes on a Sunday together,

1154
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,400
 as great as they are, but it would be the fuel

1155
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,960
 that would drive us outwards.

1156
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,480
 To the people of this city that you love so much.

1157
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,680
 There are so many Ethiopian eunuchs

1158
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,000
 just outside the doors of this community.

1159
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,000
 Lord, I pray that you would send your church.

1160
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,960
 I pray you would send us, Lord,

1161
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,400
 and that over this sermon series,

1162
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,880
 we would get the values inside of us,

1163
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,640
 the character over competency

1164
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:11,360
 that we will need for the incredible, amazing things

1165
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,800
 you are about to do.

1166
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,640
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

1167
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,360
 Everyone says, hey, would you stand with me?

1168
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,520
 I know we've gone a bit late today,

1169
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,880
 but I wanna just finish our time with some time in worship

1170
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,360
 as we just allow the spirit to move.

1171
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,400
 So let's take some time to do that now.

1172
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:34,400
