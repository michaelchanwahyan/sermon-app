1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
 - Amen. - Amen.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,520
 Thank you, Carla.

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,200
 We are a staff that loves to smile indeed.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,120
 So Carla's always got a smile on her face.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,660
 Even through the most stressful times,

6
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,800
 you'll never see Carla without a smile on her face.

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,080
 Isn't that right, Richard?

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,920
 Yes?

9
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
 Yeah, okay, yeah.

10
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,000
 Good answer.

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,120
 All right, well, good morning, y'all.

12
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,440
 Here and online.

13
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,280
 How y'all doing today?

14
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,560
 Good, okay, you'll have to excuse me a little bit.

15
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,200
 I just returned to Hong Kong after spending some time

16
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,320
 in Texas with my wife's family.

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,400
 So if I start throwing out words like y'all

18
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,080
 and fixin' to and howdy, you know,

19
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,160
 I'm not having a stroke, I'm not having an identity crisis,

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,160
 just readjusting to Hong Kong, okay?

21
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,800
 Any Texans in the house today, by the way?

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,640
 Anyone from Texas?

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,720
 No, all right, all right, all right.

24
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,420
 Okay, just me, okay.

25
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,800
 Well, our son, Isaiah, I just had to,

26
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,200
 Isaiah, that is his name, yes?

27
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,480
 Isaiah is turning two in a few weeks.

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,280
 And watching him grow has been the most lovely

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,880
 yet frustrating journey we've been on together

30
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,720
 as a family so far.

31
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,760
 Of course, there are many challenges.

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
 And one of the challenges we're facing this time

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,740
 is teaching him impulse control,

34
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,560
 which at the moment seems pretty,

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,400
 you know, it doesn't exist for him, basically.

36
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,400
 He just does whatever he wants, whenever he wants.

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,760
 This might be screaming at the top of his lungs

38
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
 for no reason.

39
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,000
 This might be, you know, throwing food across the table.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,800
 This might be licking things that he shouldn't be licking,

41
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,640
 like the MTR pole that everybody has their hands on, okay?

42
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,600
 I'm told, this is, the internet tells me,

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,760
 so it must be true, right?

44
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,940
 This is a very common stage for toddlers to go through.

45
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,560
 In fact, there's a very famous social experiment

46
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,000
 that highlights this thing about children

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,880
 and impulse control.

48
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,940
 It's called the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment.

49
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,280
 Some of you might be familiar with it.

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,320
 You might have seen the YouTube video on it.

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,680
 Basically what happens is there's a small child in a room

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,760
 and an adult walks in and gives this child a marshmallow.

53
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,160
 And he or she is told, hey, here's one marshmallow.

54
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,040
 If you wait till I come back, you know, don't eat it.

55
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,360
 If you wait till I come back and the marshmallow's still here

56
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,500
 I'm gonna bring you another one.

57
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,380
 So you'll have two.

58
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,200
 And so the adult leaves the room and they wait.

59
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,940
 And the camera's on the child.

60
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,040
 And you just see this child go through the next,

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,000
 you know, two minutes,

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,840
 the most excruciating time of their lives, right?

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
 They're sitting there staring at the marshmallow.

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,520
 You know, they're like prodding it, sniffing it,

65
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,920
 you know, trying to lick it.

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
 And some of them pinch a little bit off, you know,

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,600
 the temptation to eat it is just so much.

68
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,200
 And of course, some children just don't care.

69
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,280
 The temptation's too much.

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,680
 You just pick it up, eat it.

71
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,400
 It's like, I'm not even sorry about that, you know?

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,920
 So impulse control, resisting temptation.

73
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,920
 Now, this might sound fun to us.

74
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,860
 Been in our own walk, in our own lives.

75
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,760
 We too go through our own versions

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,600
 of battles with temptation.

77
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,080
 And I'm sure every one of us in this room

78
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,040
 knows what it feels like to really, really,

79
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,420
 really want to do the things,

80
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,460
 but we know they violate how God has called us to live.

81
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,760
 We can define temptation this way.

82
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,560
 Temptation can be defined as the inclination to sin.

83
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,840
 The pull to do and think and act in ways

84
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,180
 that we know we're not supposed to.

85
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,040
 And these things can be very seductive.

86
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,600
 They're seductive because on the surface,

87
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,160
 they seem to enhance our lives.

88
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,700
 They seem to make life better or easier or more free.

89
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,600
 But in the end, what we find is that

90
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,320
 when we give into temptation,

91
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,920
 what it actually does is diminish

92
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,900
 and maybe even tear down or destroy the genuine life

93
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,740
 that God has called us to live.

94
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,800
 The life that God truly has for us.

95
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,460
 Okay, don't switch off.

96
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,300
 It might start to get a little uncomfortable,

97
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,320
 but stay with me.

98
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,300
 We all know what we're talking about, right?

99
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,240
 That website that's just one click away.

100
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,020
 The pull to objectify another person

101
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,500
 in a purely physical, sexual way.

102
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,020
 The swipe of that credit card,

103
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,940
 well, that thing you just need so much,

104
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,220
 but you already don't know how you're gonna pay the bill

105
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,220
 from the next month.

106
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,100
 That really snarky comment that you know if you say it,

107
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,380
 it's just cut the person right down to it,

108
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,620
 put them in their place.

109
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,740
 That angry outburst you just unleash on your child

110
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,040
 without thinking about it.

111
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,380
 You're out on the night.

112
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,120
 Just one more drink, just one more drink.

113
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,580
 The ease it would be to just to take that little bit extra,

114
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,460
 no one's ever gonna know.

115
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,180
 If I take this, no one's ever gonna know.

116
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,020
 So, you know, it's fine, right?

117
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,420
 Or that relationship you keep going back to,

118
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,660
 which you know is so toxic,

119
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,600
 but for some reason you just feel like

120
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,660
 you have to keep going back there.

121
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,640
 Hashtag my life, am I right?

122
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,400
 Now, of course, for some of these things,

123
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,220
 the consequence of giving into temptation

124
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,380
 might not be so serious.

125
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,940
 Like licking empty your hand rails,

126
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,020
 yeah, it's a bit gross, you might get a bit sick,

127
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,540
 you might end up on YouTube even,

128
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,220
 but in the long run, it's okay.

129
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,480
 Screaming in a restaurant for no reason,

130
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,660
 it's a bit embarrassing, but people will get over it.

131
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,780
 Eating a lot of marshmallows, well, technically,

132
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,680
 I don't think that's even really wrong in the first place.

133
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,420
 But for some things,

134
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,940
 like the things we have just listed above,

135
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,280
 the consequence of not getting a handle

136
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,240
 can be pretty serious, are pretty serious.

137
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,080
 And so today, as we continue in the book of James,

138
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,960
 we come to a couple of passages that teach us

139
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,080
 how to stay strong in temptation.

140
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,340
 And I'm not joking when I say our lives

141
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,840
 might literally depend on how we handle

142
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,180
 these things in our lives.

143
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,240
 So you're still paying attention?

144
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,800
 Okay, good.

145
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,440
 Let's get into it then.

146
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,940
 James 1, 13, follow me if you can, please.

147
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,400
 Scripture says this,

148
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,040
 "When tempted, no one should say, 'God is tempting me.'

149
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,480
 For God cannot be tempted by evil,

150
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,460
 nor does he tempt anyone.

151
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,820
 But each person is tempted when they are dragged away

152
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,840
 by their own evil desire and enticed.

153
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,600
 Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin,

154
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,060
 and sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death."

155
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,580
 You know, there's a funny thing that happens in languages

156
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,660
 where sometimes words can sound the same,

157
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,360
 but have completely different meanings.

158
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
 Right, this happens in Cantonese.

159
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,680
 You know, you have something called tong yim chi, right?

160
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
 Which they sound the same,

161
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,360
 but the meaning is completely different.

162
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,640
 So for example, mou hei, right?

163
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,040
 In Cantonese, there's a phrase called mou hei.

164
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,760
 Mou hei can mean, "I'm out of breath, I'm tired,

165
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,280
 I need to take a break."

166
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,080
 Or mou hei can also mean,

167
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,640
 "A weapon that you use to fight or attack someone with."

168
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,480
 Right?

169
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,200
 Sounds the same, different meaning.

170
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,900
 In English, we have these words too, right?

171
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,240
 They are called homonyms.

172
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,720
 Is that right, English teachers?

173
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
 Right, homonyms.

174
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,200
 Sound the same, completely different meaning.

175
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,880
 For example, the word bark, okay?

176
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,960
 Bark can be the sound a dog makes when it's excited

177
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,520
 or trying to get your attention.

178
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,360
 Or it can be like the outer layer of a tree, right?

179
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,160
 Same sound, different meaning.

180
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,520
 Rock, for example, right?

181
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,360
 Can be chunks of granite or stone

182
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,160
 that you see lying around on the ground.

183
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,240
 Or it could be a Hollywood movie superstar.

184
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
 Same word, different meaning.

185
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,280
 Now I'm telling you this

186
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,360
 because there is a homonym happening here

187
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,640
 in this passage in the Greek.

188
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,920
 The word is perissamos.

189
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,920
 And it's a word that can mean both trials and temptations.

190
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,460
 Now last week, Pastor Carla talked to us about trials,

191
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,560
 right, about how trials can be something

192
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,760
 that we learn to take joy in.

193
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,360
 Can even be seen as a gift from God.

194
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,520
 Why is that?

195
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,040
 Well, because trials can be used to refine us,

196
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,040
 shape us, build us up so we can be,

197
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,480
 in the word of James himself, lacking in nothing.

198
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,500
 Trials can be a good thing if we embrace them

199
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,520
 in the way that we're supposed to.

200
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,800
 In fact, scripture reassures us that time and time again,

201
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,720
 God can and use trials in our lives

202
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,920
 to make us to be more like Jesus.

203
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,580
 For our own good, for the good of the community,

204
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,720
 and for the glorification of his name.

205
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,240
 And yes, they are tough and challenging to get through,

206
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,680
 but trials are a journey well worth taking.

207
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,760
 However, temptation is very different.

208
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,460
 Because temptation does not seek to glorify God

209
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,420
 or to build up his name.

210
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,760
 But temptation seeks to tear us down,

211
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,280
 to destroy us, to shame us,

212
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,700
 and ultimately to lead us into death.

213
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,680
 The point we need to understand is this,

214
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,620
 where trials and tests may come from God,

215
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,920
 the temptation to sin will never come from God.

216
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,960
 God never entices us to sin against him.

217
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,280
 It's not in his nature, it's not in his personality,

218
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,200
 it's just not the way he works.

219
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,280
 I say this is important for us to understand,

220
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,360
 because in order for us to get a handle on temptation,

221
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,640
 we need to know God's character.

222
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,840
 'Cause often what I find for myself at least is this,

223
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,600
 when I fall into temptation, I start to blame God

224
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,500
 for the place that I've put myself in.

225
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,520
 In fact, if we look to the very beginning of time,

226
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,520
 when we see how sin enters into this world,

227
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,400
 we see Adam and Eve blaming God.

228
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,680
 Adam and Eve are tempted to eat the tree,

229
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,720
 from the only tree that God told them,

230
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,100
 "Do not eat fruit from this tree, it's off limits."

231
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,080
 And they take fruit from that tree.

232
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,040
 And when God comes to the Garden of Eden

233
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,280
 and he confronts Adam about it,

234
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,760
 notice his reaction, Adam says this,

235
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,160
 "Well, it's the woman you put with me,

236
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,440
 "she gave me some of the fruit, and that's why I ate it."

237
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,720
 And then God asked Eve what happened,

238
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,300
 and Eve defects blame and she says,

239
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,680
 "Well, the serpent deceived me, that's why I ate the fruit."

240
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,320
 In other words, what Adam and Eve are saying,

241
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,400
 "You know what God, it's not our fault,

242
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,900
 "this is on you God, it's your fault.

243
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,080
 "If it wasn't for this woman,

244
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,440
 "if it wasn't for this serpent,

245
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,520
 "we would never be in the place that we are now."

246
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,840
 Like I said, how about in your own life?

247
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,180
 Do we ever find ourselves blaming God for our own mistakes?

248
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,640
 Remember what we just said,

249
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,520
 God will never entice us to sin,

250
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,460
 because God can have nothing to do with evil.

251
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,720
 Let's go back to verse 13 for a minute, okay?

252
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,320
 I think if we look at the verse this way,

253
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,720
 it's gonna highlight it quite well.

254
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,240
 We're gonna read it again,

255
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,800
 but this time notice the homonym, okay?

256
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,900
 It's been phrased in a slightly different way

257
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,840
 with this homonym in mind.

258
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,260
 Verse 13 reads like this,

259
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,820
 "When tested, no one should say God is tempting me,

260
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,400
 "for God cannot be tempted by evil,

261
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,680
 "nor does he tempt anyone."

262
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,280
 So I'll say it again, just to drive it home.

263
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,080
 God does not tempt anyone to sin.

264
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,160
 He is only good all the time,

265
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,240
 and for that reason, we can put our trust fully in Him.

266
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,900
 One more point before we carry on, okay?

267
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,120
 When I'm talking about temptation here,

268
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,240
 we have to understand that temptation itself is not sin.

269
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,040
 It's the giving into temptation, crossing that line,

270
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,900
 that's when it becomes sin.

271
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,160
 Right, after all, scripture tells us

272
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,240
 that Jesus was tempted in every single way,

273
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,180
 just as we are, yet he did not sin.

274
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,740
 That's Hebrews 4:15.

275
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,320
 So the question then becomes this,

276
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,380
 well, where does the temptation to sin come from?

277
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,520
 Verse 14, "But each person is tempted

278
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,040
 "when they are dragged away

279
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,440
 "by their own evil desire and enticed."

280
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,680
 So there's a small list here

281
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,540
 that tells us the sources of temptation.

282
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,380
 First, it says this, "Our own evil desire."

283
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,880
 Again, this is one of these uncomfortable truths

284
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,040
 that we have to embrace.

285
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,920
 And the fact is, all of us in this room,

286
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,320
 all of you guys watching online,

287
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,660
 all of us, no matter who you are,

288
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,600
 are capable of doing evil.

289
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,960
 And in this passage, James is trying to remind us

290
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,600
 that there is a sense of responsibility we have to take.

291
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,980
 He's really trying to stress that here.

292
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,520
 When we make a mess of things, when we mess things up,

293
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,120
 when we fall into sin through temptation,

294
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,780
 we have to own up to it.

295
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,840
 That's on us.

296
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
 Now, of course, this isn't saying

297
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,240
 that we only do evil all the time.

298
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,960
 Later in the letter, James is encouraging the readers

299
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,520
 and the hearers to pair the faith and the works together

300
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,280
 in order to do good things, to glorify God's name,

301
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,960
 to reach the community, to help other people,

302
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,620
 like widows and the orphans.

303
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,400
 But this is a reminder to us that as human beings,

304
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,160
 which I'm sure most of us in this room are,

305
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,240
 evil is a reality that sits within all of us.

306
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,080
 Now, you might be thinking again, evil, really?

307
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,240
 That's kind of a harsh word to use, isn't it?

308
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,800
 I mean, I know I do bad things, but is it really evil?

309
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,820
 Again, let's expand our thinking a little bit

310
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,600
 because the way evil is being used here isn't to,

311
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,080
 isn't like maybe in our imagination

312
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,720
 or the really evil things that come up to our mind.

313
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,860
 But evil is used to describe anything

314
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,360
 that falls short of God's standard.

315
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,280
 Our selfish desires, our greed, our lust, dishonesty,

316
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,400
 fits of rage and anger, neglecting the poor and the needy.

317
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,520
 All of us in this room are capable of evil acts,

318
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,320
 both big and small.

319
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,000
 And when we fall into those places,

320
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 we have to take responsibility of our own sin.

321
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,920
 So there is our own evil desires.

322
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,160
 However, there are also temptations

323
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,000
 that come to us from other sources.

324
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,360
 This is what James is talking about

325
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,720
 when it says we are dragged away and enticed.

326
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,160
 And the fact is we have a very evil enemy,

327
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,480
 a very real enemy, Satan and his minions

328
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,820
 and all the other devils that work for him

329
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,180
 who will do whatever they can to entice you

330
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,140
 to give into your own temptation.

331
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,240
 There are also people with bad intentions,

332
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,720
 people who don't necessarily have your best for you.

333
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,080
 These are people that might try to use you,

334
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,520
 try to abuse you, different ways to try and trick

335
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,760
 and manipulate you into doing things you know aren't right.

336
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,760
 And when James uses the words dragged away and enticed,

337
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,440
 the original hearers and the original readers

338
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,880
 of this letter would have immediately come up

339
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,080
 with images of things like traps and hooks

340
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,840
 that were used for like fishing and hunting

341
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,160
 to hunt and catch animals.

342
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,880
 So maybe as a bit of reflection, we can ask it like this.

343
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,540
 Do you ever find yourselves being preyed upon by evil?

344
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,360
 I mean, you're out there trying

345
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,760
 to live your best life for Jesus,

346
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,380
 but it seems like these temptations,

347
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,920
 these things just keep trying to trip you up,

348
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,840
 things trying to hunt you down

349
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,900
 and put evil thoughts and desires into your mind.

350
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:12,120
 For example, maybe just an example, right?

351
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,920
 You've just really had a wonderful time with God

352
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,840
 with your small group.

353
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,920
 Maybe you went out to do some outreach and it was amazing.

354
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,240
 You sat down with a stranger

355
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,560
 and you shared your life with them.

356
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,920
 And it was just a really good time of worshiping God together

357
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,480
 seeing him at work in the life of your small group

358
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,540
 and your community.

359
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,220
 People were deeply impacted by God this evening

360
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,140
 and it was great.

361
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,260
 But now you come home and it's quiet.

362
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,380
 Maybe you're alone.

363
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,940
 Maybe the family's already asleep.

364
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,540
 And suddenly it's as if, you know,

365
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,420
 these things just start happening in your brain,

366
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,660
 all these hooks, all these temptations.

367
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,020
 Turn on the computer, do this, do that.

368
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,500
 Check it out, nobody's gonna know.

369
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,740
 You had a tough night, you had a tiring day,

370
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,300
 you need to relax.

371
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,020
 Now, of course, the context might be slightly different

372
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,900
 from everyone here.

373
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,020
 But I think with a little bit of self-reflection

374
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,940
 and honesty, we know how this works in our own lives.

375
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,020
 Right, we get those urges.

376
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,780
 We get hooked, we get trapped.

377
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,700
 And even though we know we're not supposed to go there,

378
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,260
 suddenly we find ourselves right back in the middle

379
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,660
 of the mess we saw we left behind that last time.

380
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,900
 It's like what Paul says in his letter to the Romans.

381
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,980
 Romans 7, 19.

382
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,580
 "For I do not do the good I want to do,

383
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,580
 "but the evil I do not want to do, this I keep on doing.

384
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,340
 "Now, if I do not," sorry,

385
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,540
 "if I do what I do not want to do,

386
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,740
 "it is no longer I who do it,

387
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,300
 "but it is sin living in me that does it."

388
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,620
 Well, how do we respond when things like this happen to us?

389
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,020
 When we go through this rollercoaster,

390
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,540
 what's the right response?

391
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,460
 Well, one of the dangers is for us to play down

392
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,020
 the seriousness of sin and temptation.

393
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,020
 You know, the concept of temptation,

394
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,380
 especially it's something often gets trivialized, right?

395
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,940
 In media, in the things we see around us,

396
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,780
 it gets trivialized.

397
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,300
 We make it into this thing where it seems kind of fun,

398
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,660
 or we can float around with temptation a little bit.

399
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,980
 It's okay, it's fun and exciting.

400
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,620
 Let's see how far I can go,

401
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,780
 how far I can get away with this.

402
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,420
 And we begin telling ourselves a lie.

403
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,180
 We begin telling ourselves things like,

404
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,060
 "It's not so bad,

405
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,940
 "because it's not really hurting anybody,

406
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,820
 "so why not go there?"

407
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,420
 Church, this is a lie.

408
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,860
 And in fact, James gives us a pretty graphic picture

409
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,420
 of what happens when we follow that path,

410
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,940
 when we give into temptation and let sin run our lives.

411
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,860
 Listen carefully.

412
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,140
 After desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.

413
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,140
 And sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death.

414
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,300
 I mean, it sounds like something out of a horror movie,

415
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,900
 right, at least in my imagination,

416
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,420
 this is the kind of picture that comes up.

417
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,940
 But the reason why James is using such vivid

418
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,660
 and graphic language is that he's trying to highlight

419
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,860
 that temptation is not something

420
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,620
 that we can just mess around with.

421
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,140
 As we mentioned earlier,

422
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,100
 the consequences of giving into temptation

423
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,100
 is a very serious thing.

424
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,220
 And when we allow temptation to grow and develop,

425
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,580
 it tells us it turns into sin,

426
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,740
 and sin leads to one place only, and that is death.

427
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:43,460
 The word used here by James is conceived,

428
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,740
 and he uses it to evoke the picture of pregnancy.

429
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,700
 But James uses it somewhat ironically

430
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,940
 because in a normal, healthy conception and birth,

431
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,260
 right, in a normal, healthy circumstance,

432
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,620
 birth leads to joy and new life.

433
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,700
 I mean, I will never know how hard it is

434
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,820
 for a woman to carry a child in the womb for nine months,

435
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,460
 that whole journey, it's tiring, it's tough.

436
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,340
 But what I do know is that at the end of that,

437
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,180
 there is great joy in celebrating new life.

438
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,460
 But in this case, there is nothing good

439
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,740
 that comes from giving birth.

440
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,500
 Because in this case, we are giving birth to sin.

441
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,620
 And as it says in Scripture,

442
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,260
 sin, when it is full grown, gives birth or leads to death.

443
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:37,620
 Again, listen, church, it's important to remember

444
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,020
 because like we said, there are times

445
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,060
 when we feel like we can just walk in temptation

446
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,060
 and get away with it.

447
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,140
 It doesn't hurt anyone, we're thinking.

448
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,180
 It's not gonna be a big deal.

449
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,140
 Or we try and justify it by saying things like,

450
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,240
 you know, if you only knew the stress that I'm facing,

451
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,100
 if you only knew the pressures that I'm up against,

452
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,940
 you would understand why I have to turn to these things.

453
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,940
 But the path is clear.

454
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,640
 When we succumb to our temptations, it leads to sin.

455
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,580
 And sin, when it grows up,

456
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,260
 Romans 6, 23 says it in a different way,

457
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,920
 same message though.

458
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,820
 The wages of the consequence of sin is death.

459
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,660
 So put it in a very simple diagram.

460
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,500
 It might look a bit like this.

461
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,980
 Temptation leads to our own evil desires.

462
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,820
 We fall into sin, which leads to death.

463
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,060
 Now, when we focus on the word death,

464
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,940
 again, it seems kind of harsh.

465
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,020
 I mean, it's like one of these Bible verses, right?

466
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,860
 That Christians use to bash other people,

467
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,000
 to scare people to believing in Jesus.

468
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,200
 And besides, it's not even true, is it?

469
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,640
 Because I know a lot of people

470
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,280
 who don't seem to worry about sin or temptation.

471
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,820
 They just do whatever they want to do

472
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,960
 whenever they want to do it.

473
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,220
 And life seems to be fine for them.

474
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,460
 They don't seem to be dying.

475
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,660
 In fact, it seems like they're having a great time with life.

476
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,820
 So it's important, again, to understand what James means

477
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,880
 when he uses the word death.

478
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,520
 It's not so much a literal physical death,

479
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,840
 although I think we can all imagine scenarios

480
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,140
 where giving into temptation will literally lead you

481
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,940
 to an actual physical death.

482
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,180
 But I think the bigger meaning,

483
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,560
 if we expand the definition a little bit,

484
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,400
 death, what James is talking about,

485
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,160
 is a life separated from God's truth.

486
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,840
 Death is a life separated from the fullness

487
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,900
 that Jesus promises his believers,

488
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,020
 which is why he reminds us, verse 16,

489
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,760
 "Do not be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters."

490
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,760
 Do not be deceived.

491
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,200
 Because yes, on the surface,

492
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,880
 it might seem as though people living that way,

493
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,300
 it's good, it's fine.

494
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,860
 It might appear as though those who live

495
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,220
 without any worry about sin and temptation ever,

496
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,260
 all figured out, they do whatever they want to do,

497
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,300
 follow their own desires, that's the way to live your life.

498
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,100
 Again, just being honest in a moment of reflection here.

499
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,940
 I've often thought this to myself.

500
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,200
 I wonder if you have too.

501
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,320
 Sometimes I feel like life would be so much easier

502
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,520
 if I wasn't a Christian.

503
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,580
 I think for me, this is one of the biggest temptations.

504
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,220
 I see how people live,

505
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,960
 and I see when people don't seem to care

506
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,860
 about resisting temptation or doing the wrong thing,

507
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,500
 it looks really good.

508
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,540
 It's very tempting for me.

509
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,780
 They just do whatever they want, whenever they want,

510
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,260
 and it always looks fun.

511
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,140
 And I sometimes find myself looking with envy and jealousy.

512
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,300
 I begin to ask God questions like, "Come on, Jesus.

513
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,440
 "How come I had to be called into ministry?

514
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,780
 "Why do I have to care so much

515
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,960
 "about what you think and feel and say?

516
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,280
 "Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?"

517
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,560
 How about you?

518
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,560
 Where have you been deceived?

519
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,400
 Where have you ever felt like giving into temptation

520
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,300
 is better than a life with Jesus?

521
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:25,800
 Brothers and sisters, do not be deceived.

522
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,040
 Temptation and sin lead to one place only,

523
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,840
 and that is death.

524
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,920
 Because all these enticing things we see before us right now,

525
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,580
 one day, they're not gonna exist anymore.

526
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,860
 It's like flowers that fade.

527
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,360
 It's like a vapor in the wind.

528
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
 One day, these things will not exist.

529
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,160
 And in the end, that only thing that will remain

530
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,200
 is the truth of God's Word and His love for us.

531
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,700
 And so therefore, when we live outside of that truth

532
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,240
 and that love, that is death.

533
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,940
 And yes, it might not literally kill you

534
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,540
 right there on the spot,

535
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,320
 but it does mean that you will be living a life

536
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,220
 less than the genuine full version of God,

537
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,420
 of who God created you to be.

538
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,360
 Remember what Jesus said in John 10, 10.

539
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,800
 "The thief, the enemy, sin comes to steal,

540
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,160
 "kill, and destroy.

541
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,660
 "But I have come that they, that y'all,

542
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,740
 "might have life and have it to the full."

543
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,640
 So what do we do?

544
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,440
 Is there something to help us

545
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,580
 out this road of self-destruction?

546
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,620
 Well, good news is yes.

547
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,220
 Because remember what we said earlier?

548
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,020
 It's not in God's nature for Him to entice us to sin.

549
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,560
 It's not in His nature to lead us into temptation.

550
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,960
 God will never ask you to sin.

551
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,900
 But rather, this is what God does do for us.

552
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,040
 Verse 17, James 1.

553
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,400
 "Every good and perfect gift is from above,

554
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,300
 "coming down from the Father of heavenly light,

555
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,940
 "who does not change like shifting shadows.

556
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,280
 "He chose to give us birth through the word of truth,

557
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,780
 "that we might be a kind of first fruits of all He created."

558
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,680
 So this is the truth then.

559
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,620
 The God we serve is good and He is perfect.

560
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,920
 Everything that comes from God is good and perfect.

561
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,760
 And when sin and temptation shifts and changes

562
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,860
 and hides in the dark, God is light.

563
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,500
 And God is unchanging, which means God is trustworthy.

564
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,200
 But notice something really cool here, Will.

565
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,600
 This is some of the coolest parts that I noticed.

566
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,940
 Remember just now when James was talking about

567
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,740
 how sin leads to temptation,

568
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,680
 which leads to gives birth to death.

569
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,880
 He was using that birth analogy.

570
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,920
 Well, James picks up on that here once again.

571
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,420
 But this time, the path is quite different.

572
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,320
 "Whereas evil desires ending up giving birth

573
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,060
 "to sin and death, God gives us birth

574
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,020
 "through the word of truth.

575
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,600
 "And that leads to us becoming the first fruits

576
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,500
 "of all He created."

577
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,500
 So if we were to put this into a diagram,

578
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,040
 it looks like this.

579
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,540
 God gives us truth, gives birth to truth,

580
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,520
 which makes us into the first fruits of God's creation.

581
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,380
 Now, if you remember back to the Old Testament,

582
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,720
 the first fruits are the first and best part

583
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,560
 of every single harvest.

584
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,720
 In the Old Testament times, God's Lord commanded

585
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,200
 that we all gather up the first fruits

586
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,460
 and present them to God.

587
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,460
 They are holy.

588
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,900
 They belong to God.

589
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,100
 In other words, what James is trying to tell us here

590
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,440
 is that all of us in this room,

591
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,880
 yes, we are capable of sin and evil,

592
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,440
 but you are also the best of God's creation.

593
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,400
 We belong to God.

594
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,880
 Every single person in this room

595
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,780
 is a unique, sacred possession of God.

596
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,280
 And you weren't meant to live a life

597
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,280
 that's constantly wracked by sin and temptation,

598
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,260
 but you were born, you were created

599
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,460
 to live a life of truth and flourishing.

600
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,220
 You were made to represent the best of who God is,

601
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,800
 the best of God's love.

602
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,200
 That's who you are.

603
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,640
 That is your identity.

604
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,040
 So how do we live there instead?

605
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,740
 How do we move from a life of sin and temptation

606
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,040
 into that place?

607
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:36,180
 Okay, now I know this sermon so far

608
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,380
 sounded a little bit scalding, right?

609
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,620
 It sounded a bit like, you're just a bunch of sinners.

610
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,620
 We all are sinners.

611
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,580
 Everyone needs to stop being tempted.

612
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,780
 Stop sinning, behave yourselves,

613
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,520
 pull yourself up by your bootstrap, Hayden,

614
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,460
 and you're gonna be okay, all right?

615
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,620
 And you're sitting here like,

616
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,500
 dude, I brought a friend with me today.

617
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,500
 Okay, this is, we don't need this right now.

618
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,460
 Stay with me, please, okay?

619
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,400
 Ultimately, this is not a message

620
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,940
 about making you feel to feel bad and act right.

621
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,220
 Because the answer is, right, the answer to escaping sin

622
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,180
 is not to just modify your behavior,

623
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,020
 to do better, to try harder.

624
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,780
 There is a way out of temptation,

625
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,660
 but it's not by gritting your teeth

626
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,360
 and trying to live life better.

627
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,400
 Rather, it comes from a loving, true relationship with God.

628
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,640
 When we go to chapter four in James, it tells us this.

629
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,900
 This is how we do it.

630
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,980
 This is the way out.

631
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,540
 Submit yourselves then to God.

632
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,640
 Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

633
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,780
 Come near to God and he will come near to you.

634
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,820
 Wash your hands, you sinners.

635
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,060
 Purify your heart, you double-minded.

636
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,500
 So for those of us listening right now,

637
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,600
 you're feeling like you're sick and tired

638
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,900
 of being sick and tired.

639
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,700
 You're feeling like, yes, I know.

640
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,900
 I don't want to do these things anymore.

641
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,640
 I just don't know how to stop.

642
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,740
 Those of us who are feeling a bit hopeless

643
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,940
 because you've tried and tried and tried,

644
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,580
 but things never seem to get better,

645
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,420
 at least not for the long run.

646
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,520
 It's a bit of success.

647
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,060
 Right back to square one again.

648
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,820
 Here's the good news.

649
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,460
 There is a way out.

650
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,460
 There is a way out, and it all comes from a relationship

651
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,300
 with the God who sees you not as a sinner,

652
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:39,240
 not as death, but he sees you as his first fruit.

653
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,740
 It's in a relationship with the God

654
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,080
 who wants to give you good and perfect gifts.

655
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,380
 And this is what he calls us to do.

656
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,880
 These are some very real and practical steps

657
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,720
 that we can take in order to live the life

658
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,280
 that God has called us to live.

659
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,860
 The first step is this.

660
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
 We submit to God.

661
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,220
 Now I know, again, the word submit

662
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,200
 often has some very negative connotations to it

663
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,900
 because when we abuse people who are in submission to us,

664
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,880
 who are under our authority,

665
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,600
 that can lead to some really bad things,

666
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,580
 to abuse, to hurt, to pain.

667
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,780
 But remember what we said just now.

668
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,040
 God is trustworthy.

669
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,360
 He is the giver of only good things.

670
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,020
 So when we choose to submit to God,

671
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,420
 we don't have to fear because God is good.

672
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,060
 And for those of you who are like, you know what?

673
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,900
 I don't like to submit to anybody.

674
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,940
 I run my own life.

675
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,300
 Well, the truth is everybody submits to something.

676
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,400
 When you live your own life, when you go that path,

677
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,900
 you're submitting to sin and temptation.

678
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,240
 You're still in submission.

679
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,200
 It might not feel like it at that time.

680
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,020
 So the point is this.

681
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,780
 We have to make a choice.

682
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,720
 We either choose to submit to God who gives us life

683
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,600
 or we submit to sin that leads us into death.

684
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,260
 The second thing we do is this.

685
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,240
 It tells us to resist the devil

686
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,700
 and he will flee from you.

687
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:19,140
 Now I know when we talk about the devil and the enemy,

688
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,580
 it sounds evil and scary.

689
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,180
 And the devil might appear to be powerful

690
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,620
 and able to do a lot of things,

691
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,580
 but in reality, the devil is a coward.

692
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,460
 He is a coward.

693
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,520
 And when he's resisted with the prayer

694
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,420
 that claims the victory of Jesus on the cross,

695
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,200
 he knows he's beaten.

696
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,760
 He knows he's been defeated.

697
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,980
 Now his tactic, the enemy's tactic

698
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,660
 will always be try to trick you, to scare you,

699
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,600
 to whisper lies into your ear, to tell you that,

700
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,200
 "You know what?

701
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,760
 "Don't bother.

702
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,600
 "We've been here before.

703
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,060
 "We all know how this ends.

704
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,840
 "You won't be able to resist.

705
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,980
 "So let's just come with me straight away.

706
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,540
 "Why are you bothering with all this Jesus stuff?"

707
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:09,220
 Church, listen to me when I say this.

708
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,080
 That is the lie.

709
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,020
 That is the lie from the pits of hell.

710
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,920
 You can resist the devil.

711
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,260
 And when you resist the devil, he will run.

712
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,320
 Remind yourself that ultimately,

713
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,660
 the enemy has already been defeated

714
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,400
 because of what Jesus did on the cross

715
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,200
 and his resurrection from death to life.

716
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,760
 Satan's power in this life might be very real,

717
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,880
 but it's also very limited.

718
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,000
 His kingdom will not last forever,

719
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,580
 but God's kingdom will.

720
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,480
 So fear not.

721
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,640
 Stand firm, resist the devil, and he will run.

722
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,420
 He will flee from you.

723
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,280
 And the best place we find the strength

724
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,820
 and the protection to stand firm is to do this.

725
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:00,320
 Draw near to God, and he'll draw near to you.

726
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,900
 This is a promise.

727
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,900
 Draw near to God, and he'll draw near to you.

728
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,200
 Now again, honestly speaking,

729
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,600
 for me, this is the hardest thing to believe.

730
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,640
 Because as a young boy growing up,

731
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,220
 I was always terrified of admitting I was wrong,

732
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,140
 especially with my parents.

733
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,980
 Now we've done a lot of work in this,

734
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,220
 especially in the past few months.

735
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,380
 Me and my mom have had some really good conversation

736
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,480
 in this area.

737
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,120
 But honestly, growing up,

738
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,620
 anytime I would make a mistake,

739
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,700
 I would be so afraid to tell my mom what had happened

740
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,620
 because I was fearful of the punishment

741
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,540
 that might await me on the other side.

742
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,240
 Terrified.

743
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,940
 This also happened in school.

744
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,020
 One of the things that I hated most in school,

745
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,720
 I grew up in a British boarding school,

746
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,480
 and every now and then, almost every day even,

747
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,680
 my housemaster would pull me into his office and say,

748
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,460
 "Hey, Ellison, tell me what you've done wrong."

749
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,220
 I hated that question because on any given day,

750
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,200
 I'd done multiple things wrong.

751
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,060
 And so I would be afraid.

752
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,300
 If I told him something he didn't already know,

753
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,160
 I'd be in more trouble than I already was.

754
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,500
 "Oh, yeah, sorry, sir, I missed physics today."

755
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,740
 "You missed physics?

756
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,100
 "I'm talking about that history homework

757
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,280
 "you didn't hand in for the past three weeks already.

758
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
 "What's going on?"

759
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,540
 But maybe you can relate.

760
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,260
 Many times in life, when we make a mess of things,

761
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,680
 the natural inclination is to hide.

762
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,800
 The natural inclination is to pull back,

763
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,200
 to cover ourselves up.

764
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,900
 And we can easily start to do this with God.

765
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,340
 We fall into temptation, we sin,

766
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,540
 and we begin to think of ourselves as unworthy.

767
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,100
 We begin to think God doesn't want anything

768
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,340
 to do with us anymore.

769
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,380
 We begin to think He's gonna punish us

770
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,560
 to keep His distance from us, maybe even reject us.

771
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:02,020
 James reminds us here that anytime we go close to God,

772
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,500
 anytime we draw near to God,

773
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,400
 no matter in what situation we're in,

774
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,260
 His response will never be to stay away

775
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,700
 or to put further distance between you and Him.

776
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,880
 Remember the story of how Jesus encounters lepers,

777
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,840
 when He sees lepers?

778
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,020
 Everyone else would run away from lepers in Jesus' time,

779
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,780
 but He was the one who moved towards the unclean.

780
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,580
 Remember the story of the prodigal son,

781
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,360
 how the prodigal son, the younger son ran away,

782
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,760
 but as he comes back, the father's there,

783
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,760
 waiting, running to the son, not to punish, not to scold,

784
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,260
 but to love, to embrace, to celebrate.

785
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,080
 And God feels the same way about you.

786
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,740
 This is a promise.

787
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,740
 No matter who you are, no matter what you've done,

788
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,720
 no matter how many times you've messed up,

789
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,720
 if we decide to submit, to go close to God,

790
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,560
 His response is always to come nearer to you.

791
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,660
 It's really that simple.

792
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:14,700
 When we approach God, He will never, ever, ever reject us.

793
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:21,740
 So how do we respond then?

794
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,140
 God is ready and He's waiting.

795
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,940
 We need to do some self-reflection here.

796
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,880
 So I wonder if you just take a time,

797
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,380
 forget about people around you for a second, okay?

798
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:39,120
 Some of the things that we're wrestling with

799
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,360
 in this room right now might be really big things.

800
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,660
 I understand that.

801
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,000
 There might not be enough space and time

802
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,960
 in this moment right now

803
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,300
 to truly get to the depths of those.

804
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,860
 There might be a long journey ahead of you,

805
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,140
 is what I'm saying.

806
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,980
 It might require a lot of prayer,

807
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,080
 a lot of support from your community,

808
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,280
 maybe even some professional therapy.

809
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,080
 There might be a long road.

810
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,280
 It's a big mess.

811
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,460
 But the encouragement here is this.

812
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,220
 We have to start somewhere.

813
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,000
 So maybe we can start right here, right now.

814
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,500
 So you might wanna close your eyes right now

815
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,400
 and just listen to what God has to say to you.

816
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,000
 (gentle music)

817
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,700
 And perhaps right in this moment,

818
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,440
 you have to make a decision

819
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,500
 about how you're gonna live your life,

820
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,780
 who you're gonna choose to submit to.

821
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,420
 When we go back and forth,

822
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,580
 James in this passage calls it double-mindedness.

823
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,760
 We can't make our minds up.

824
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,820
 We can't seem to make our minds up.

825
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,360
 Who do we want to live for?

826
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,660
 Who do I want to follow?

827
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,260
 (gentle music)

828
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,000
 So maybe what you need to do right now

829
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,900
 is as simple as this.

830
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,040
 It's just to make your mind up once again.

831
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,340
 Not everything's gonna become perfect immediately,

832
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,180
 but that's okay.

833
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,080
 It's a journey.

834
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:22,580
 But what we can do is take that first step towards God.

835
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,440
 And as you do that, be reassured, church,

836
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,280
 my brother, my sister, all that awaits you is love,

837
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,660
 is mercy, it's grace and forgiveness.

838
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,160
 And in this process, James also encouraged us to do this.

839
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,340
 He says, "To purify our hearts."

840
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,640
 Because remember, this isn't just

841
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,680
 about behavior modification.

842
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,140
 Purifying your heart means that you're willing

843
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,120
 to change from the inside out.

844
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,420
 You're willing to truly confess and repent

845
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,760
 and to make a real change in the way

846
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,760
 you've been living your life and who you've been living for.

847
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,160
 But be confident also.

848
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,200
 That you don't have to do this in your own power,

849
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,780
 but we have a Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God

850
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,800
 that leads us and guides us.

851
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,720
 Jesus has already done the work of paying the debt of sin

852
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,520
 so we can live pure and holy lives.

853
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,880
 And maybe your prayer this morning is to ask for God

854
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,620
 to give you a heart that's in tune with His.

855
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,220
 And as we do this church, this is how we submit to God.

856
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,000
 This is how we draw close to God.

857
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 And the enemy flees because he has no power

858
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,600
 in God's presence.

859
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,580
 And you shake off the chains of temptation and sin

860
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:15,740
 in order to embrace the freedom and the fullness

861
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,680
 which God has given you to live.

862
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,780
 You are His first fruits, church.

863
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,580
 You are made to reflect God's love,

864
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,580
 God's goodness to kindness,

865
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,460
 so that everyone around you might know the goodness,

866
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,320
 the kindness and the love of God.

867
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,600
 So my prayer for us is this,

868
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:41,600
 that we may live every day drawing nearer and nearer

869
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,940
 to the God who loves us.

870
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,980
 (gentle music)

871
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,740
 So Father, I thank you for every person

872
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,620
 in this room right now,

873
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,280
 and all of us, all those who are joining online.

874
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:03,100
 Father, I thank you that no matter what state we're in,

875
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:08,820
 where we come near to you, you embrace us,

876
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,680
 you reassure us, you love us.

877
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,900
 No matter how broken we are,

878
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,400
 Isaiah 42, three says, "A bruised reed he will not break,

879
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,460
 "a smoldering wick he will not snuff out.

880
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,180
 "As long as there's breath in our lungs,

881
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:31,940
 "Lord, we can come to you and you draw near to us."

882
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,780
 So Father, with these things we're wrestling with,

883
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,180
 with sin and temptation and evil that tries to drag us down

884
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,100
 and entice us and entangle us,

885
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,380
 I pray for freedom from these things.

886
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,780
 I pray that you would give us strong hearts

887
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,340
 and strong minds, not empowered by own will,

888
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,220
 but motivated by your love,

889
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,980
 and powered by the Holy Spirit,

890
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,060
 we would know what the fullness of life is

891
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,180
 when we walk in step in freedom with you.

892
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,980
 So Jesus, we love you.

893
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,700
 Walk with us in this journey.

894
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,780
 Help us up when we fall.

895
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,120
 Help us to encourage each other in this.

896
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,260
 And may we truly be a community,

897
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,500
 be a people that lives as your first fruits,

898
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,760
 the best, the best of who you created us to be.

899
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,760
 We thank you for this in your beautiful name, amen.
